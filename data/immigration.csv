The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio filed lawsuits against the sheriff’s offices in Geauga and Seneca counties in May and August, respectively. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the suit against Geauga County can move forward.

“It's important to understand the government works for us. Public records belong to the public. We're only asking for records that we're entitled clearly to receive,” said Freda Levenson, the ACLU of Ohio’s chief legal officer.

The ACLU of Ohio requested documents regarding contracts and communication with U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement.

“Specifically, we want to know how the government is detaining immigrants, the location, the conditions, the cost, the numbers. We've heard of appalling conditions in these facilities. We have humanitarian concerns, legal concerns, financial concerns,” Levenson said. “Taxpayers, residents of Seneca County have a right to know how their law enforcement officers are being deployed, how their facilities are being utilized, how the money is being spent.”

Six jails in Ohio currently serve as detention centers for ICE, including the Geauga County Safety Center and the Seneca County Jail, both of which are managed by the sheriff’s offices.

The other four jails in Ohio that hold ICE detainees are the Butler County Sheriff’s Office in Hamilton, the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker, the Mahoning County Justice Center and the Northeast Ohio Correctional Facility in Youngstown.

In line with the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on immigration and increase ICE enforcement, five sheriff’s offices in Ohio have signed 287(g) contracts with ICE — agreements that allow local law enforcement to take on some federal immigration enforcement duties.

The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office entered 287(g) contracts in February. Sheriff’s offices in Butler, Fayette, Lake and Portage counties also have 287(g) contracts.

“The ACLU of Ohio is committed to protecting immigrants' rights,” Levenson said. “We also are committed to being a watchdog for government transparency and accountability.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents surrounded a home Thursday in the Chambersburg section of South Trenton. The agents failed to gain entry to detain an unknown number of people inside.

Advocates, elected officials and a number of community members stood behind the yellow police tape while the situation unfolded. ICE later left the scene.

“Evidently, ICE was not able to effectuate a warrant, and so they left the scene,” Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said. “It just showed from the beginning that they did not have a legitimate purpose for being there.”

ICE acknowledged receipt of a WHYY News request for comment, but did not immediately answer questions. Gusciora described the scene as a “standoff.”

“We’re claiming victory because we prevented a family and others from being detained,” said Ana Paola Pazmino, executive director of Resistencia En Accion NJ.

She said the organization responded to the Bayard Street home after receiving a call Thursday morning.

The caller informed Resistencia En Accion NJ that ICE agents attempted to arrest three men who were entering a vehicle to get to work. Pazmino said ICE managed to detain one individual, but the other two fled. At least one entered the home.

“ICE agents are outside,” Pazmino said while the standoff was still active. “They’re roaming the streets. They have about seven unmarked cars. They don’t have warrants.”

Pazmino said ICE agents berated and intimidated bystanders with “degrading” remarks. Law enforcement cordoned off the street. Advocates, upon their arrival, confronted ICE.

“There’s children inside. People are hiding in closets calling us to see what’s going on,” Pazmino said.

The Trenton Police Department did not immediately return calls for comment regarding ICE’s operation. Gusciora said the Trenton Police Department is not assisting ICE.

“There’s an attorney general’s directive that they’re not to collaborate, but we’re here because of the protests and that we’re trying to protect the peace of the neighborhood,” Gusciora said.

A Radio Jornalera NJ livestream of the confrontation showed the Trenton Police Department detaining Asma Elhuni, an organizer with Resistencia En Accion NJ’s rapid response team. According to the organization, she’s since been released with a summons.

Pazmino said the organization has photos and videos of local police allowing ICE to cross the police tape.

“Even if we are trying to say that we’re not working with ICE agents federally, police and localities need to do a better job of not allowing them into these spaces, because children are terrified,” Pazmino said.

Gusciora said residents are upset with ICE’s actions in Trenton. And so is he.

“My family is a family of immigrants,” Gusciora said. “They came 100 years ago, and they contributed to the economy and made America a better nation.

Officials were on the lookout for anything that could render an immigrant deportable, the department initially told the Associated Press (AP), potentially affecting up to 55 million people.

""We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,"" the department later told Newsweek in a statement.

Why It Matters

The administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly made clear that it is taking a tough stance on immigration and border security, with the State Department playing a key role in determining eligibility for visa applications from overseas. It also monitors ongoing temporary visas, such as student and cultural exchange programs.

What To Know

The State Department's assertion that all visa holders were subject to continual vetting is not necessarily new information, with various instances of visas being revoked in recent months, particularly those of foreign students.

The federal government as a whole is taking an increasingly tougher approach to legal immigration, with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) recently announcing its agents would be on the lookout for anti-Americanism from benefits applicants going forward.

Any such expressions could see visa extensions, green cards or naturalizations denied.

The State Department's message on Thursday appeared to reflect a similar sentiment, with officials confirming to Newsweek that the agency was looking for any indicators of ineligibility, such as visa overstays, threats to public safety and criminal activity.

With several million legal immigrants in the U.S. at any one time, it remained to be seen how such ongoing vetting could be achieved.

A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek that officials were reviewing all available information as part of vetting processes, including law enforcement and immigration records.

Since January, the spokesperson said, the department had revoked twice as many visas as during the same period last year.

What People Are Saying

USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser, in a news release earlier this week: ""America's benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible.""

What's Next

The language from the State Department on Thursday indicated a renewed effort to check up on immigrants within the U.S., but it was not immediately clear how such check-ins would take place.

The ministry said in a statement that the agreement had been concluded but that terms were still being worked out. It added that Uganda prefers that the migrants sent there be of African nationalities, but did not elaborate on what Uganda might get in return for accepting deportees.

The U.S. embassy in Uganda declined to comment on what it called ""diplomatic negotiations,"" but said that diplomats were seeking to uphold U.S. President Donald Trump's ""policy of keeping Americans safe.""

The Trump administration has been seeking ways to deter migrants from entering the country illegally and to deport those who already have done so, especially those with criminal records and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home country.

Human rights activists criticized the deportee deal as possibly going against international law.

Henry Okello Oryem, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, on Wednesday had denied that any agreement on deportees had been reached, though he said his government was in discussions about ""visas, tariffs, sanctions, and related issues."" He also suggested that his country would draw the line at accepting people associated with criminal groups.

""We are talking about cartels: people who are unwanted in their own countries. How can we integrate them into local communities in Uganda?"" he said at the time.

Oryem and other Ugandan government officials declined to comment Thursday.

Opposition lawmaker Muwada Nkunyingi suggested that such a deal with the United States would give the Ugandan government legitimacy ahead of elections, and urged Washington not to turn a blind eye toward what he described as human rights and governance issues in Uganda.

Uganda's leaders will rush into a deal to ""clear their image now that we are heading into the 2026 elections,"" Nkunyingi said.

Human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio likened a deportee deal to human trafficking, and said it would leave status of the deportees unclear. ""Are they refugees or prisoners?"" he said.

""The proposed deal runs afoul of international law. We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,"" he said. ""That I can keep your prisoners if you pay me; how is that different from human trafficking?""

In July, the U.S. deported five men with criminal backgrounds to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini and sent eight more to South Sudan. The men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Vietnam sent to Eswatini are being held in solitary confinement until they can be deported to their home countries, which could take up to a year.

A legal challenge in the U.S had halted the deportation process of the eight men in South Sudan but a Supreme Court ruling eventually cleared the way for them to be sent to South Sudan.

Uganda has had challenges with the U.S. after lawmakers passed an anti-homosexuality bill in 2023 that punishes consensual same-sex conduct with penalties including life imprisonment. Washington threatened consequences and the World Bank withheld some funding.

“There is nothing holding the school districts accountable in any meaningful way,” she said.
“They are testing boundaries,” she said of the Trump administration.","The Trump administration has rescinded federal guidance requiring schools to provide a broad range of services to students who are not proficient in English.

Those services include language acquisition classes, supports for disabilities and access to grade-level curriculum materials.

The guidance was issued in 2015 under President Barack Obama. At that time, the Education and Justice Departments told school districts that failing to provide such services would violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which seeks to prevent discrimination based on race and national origin.

But under President Trump, the White House has pursued a near-reversal of the federal government’s interpretation of Title VI. Instead of using the law to seek support for racial and ethnic minorities, as it was established to do, the administration has often argued that efforts to help groups such as immigrant and Black children are discriminatory toward other students.

The rescission was first reported by The Washington Post.

In a statement, the Education Department said the rescinded guidance “was overly prescriptive and micro-managing of how states implement federal English language programs.”

The statement added: “States have vastly different needs for this important population of students and are best equipped to determine how best to educate these students while following all applicable federal laws.”

School districts might not immediately change their practices in response to the rescission. Many are committed to providing these services.

But experts cautioned that without federal pressure, some districts would weaken their supports for students learning English. Staff cuts at the Education Department have drastically reduced the number of employees who support local schools in the areas of language-acquisition and civil rights.

Jill Siegelbaum, a former lawyer at the agency whose position was eliminated earlier this month, said she was concerned that districts would respond to the rescission of the guidance by failing to integrate students learning English into the mainstream school population.

“There is nothing holding the school districts accountable in any meaningful way,” she said.

She also pointed out that the underlying laws and regulations regarding the rights of students learning English had not changed since the 1980s.

“They are testing boundaries,” she said of the Trump administration. “And they don’t seem to have any problem challenging laws that have been repeatedly tested, examined, re-examined and relied upon for significant periods of time. That is true across the board.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21trump-news-english-learners-gmth/21trump-news-english-learners-gmth-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 17:57:19.948250

While the government initially said it would focus only on dangerous criminals, thousands of people are being arrested daily, with the New York Times estimating this week that the government is on track to deport 400,000 people in 2025.

Authorities have gone after working immigrants through unprecedented raids of restaurants, construction sites, and farms – as well as in courthouses where immigration agents arrest those attending civil appointments needed to help legalise their status.

“Obviously Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuary.","The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has threatened to “flood” Boston with immigration agents following Mayor Michelle Wu’s refusal to drop the city’s sanctuary policies.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said during a Wednesday interview on ""The Howie Carr Show,"" a conservative radio program, that the agency would expand its presence in the area. His comments followed a news conference on Tuesday at which Wu said that Boston would “not back down” from its policy of limiting police from cooperating with ICE on civil immigration enforcement efforts.

Lyons said that sanctuary policies like Boston's are detrimental to safety.

“We’re definitely going to, as you’ve heard the saying, flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said on the radio show. “Obviously Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuary. … So 100%, you’re going to see more ICE presence.”

When asked about Lyons’ interview, Wu’s office directed NBC News to the mayor’s comments to reporters on the topic at an unrelated Thursday event.

“This is a beautiful, diverse, incredible city, and I have said it now very directly: This administration needs to stop attacking cities to hide their own failures,” Wu said.

Boston has a robust immigrant population, with more than 28% of its residents being foreign-born as of 2021. China, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Vietnam make up the top countries of origin. In recent years, crime has continued to drop steadily, with homicides reaching a historic low by the end of 2024. Robberies, aggravated assaults and motor vehicle thefts and fraud related offenses have also dropped across Massachusetts, according to data released by the state.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration came to a head last week, when the Justice Department sent letters to 35 sanctuary jurisdictions demanding they end the immigration protections. The DOJ ordered the jurisdictions to submit plans by early this week to show that they are taking steps to ditch the policies, threatening to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn’t comply.

“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,” the letter, signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, said. “This ends now.”

Wu hit back in a heated letter to Bondi on Tuesday, calling the attorney general’s demands an “attack” on U.S. cities and a tactic to “make Americans fearful of one another.”

“On behalf of the people of Boston, and in solidarity with the cities and communities targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion, we affirm our support for each other and for our democracy,” Wu wrote. “Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone.”

The Boston mayor further slammed the DOJ’s demands during a news conference outside City Hall that same day.

“You are wrong on the law and you are wrong on safety,” Wu said. “Most of all, you are wrong on cities.”

Boston’s immigration protections stretch back to 2014, when the city enacted the Boston Trust Act aimed at promoting trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. The legislation, which was amended in 2019, allows the Boston Police Department to collaborate with ICE on issues of “significant public safety” — including human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking and cybercrimes — but keeps the department out of civil immigration enforcement. Most recently, at the end of 2024, the City Council adopted a resolution that reaffirmed the act.

“The Trust Act’s provisions have been instrumental in fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all residents, ensuring that immigrants can engage with local law enforcement without fear of deportation,” the resolution said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250821-michelle-wu-ew-1155a-f833bf.jpg",N,,2025-08-21 17:57:34.656882

The blowup in Navis' courtroom comes after was charged in May with obstructing federal officers and attempting to hide a person to avoid arrest. Authorities said Dugan tried to help a man who is in the country illegally evade U.S. immigration agents who wanted to arrest him in her courthouse.

Dugan is seeking to have , arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore is immune to prosecution. A ruling on that motion by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman is pending.

Navis was presiding in his courtroom that day in the case of Enrrique Onan Zamora Castro, of Milwaukee, who faced a misdemeanor charge of operating a vehicle without a valid driver's license for the second time in three years.

A court transcript shows that Navis objected to sheriff's deputies attempting to detain Castro on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, without a valid federal warrant.

""In my courtroom, a person cannot be detained without lawful authority,"" Navis said in the transcript.

The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Andrew Herrmann, said Navis had no right to see the warrant, according to the transcript. Herrmann did not respond to a voicemail seeking comment.

According to the transcript, Navis said, ""I've been instructed by the judges of this county to require warrants before individuals are detained in my courtroom.""

None of the four Walworth County judges returned emails seeking comment.

Walworth County Clerk of Courts Michele Jacobs said deputies routinely arrest people on warrants in the courthouse.

Walworth County Sheriff Dave Gerber and ICE officials did not respond to email messages seeking comment.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas.
The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews.
But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.
Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders’ social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.","In a written answer to a question posed by The Associated Press, the department said that all U.S. visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye toward any indication that they could be ineligible for the document.

Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked and, if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation.

The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization.

“We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department’s new language suggests that the re-vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread.

Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders’ social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.

“As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said.

Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters to leaders of these jurisdictions, including to Wu, demanding that they abandon their sanctuary policies.
We are going to keep making Boston safe, as she’s failing to do with the sanctuary policies,” Lyons said of Wu.
Under a 2017 Supreme Judicial Court decision, local authorities cannot detain someone just because federal immigration authorities believe they are subject to civil removal.
“You can see all the success we’re having nationwide, and people are now understanding exactly the law enforcement mission of ICE,” Lyons said.","Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, said more federal agents are needed in Boston to counteract Mayor Michelle Wu's policies.

The head of ICE said Wednesday that the agency was preparing to increase its presence in and around Boston, potentially ratcheting up tensions between local leaders and federal law enforcement officials.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, made the comments during an interview on “The Howie Carr Show” when he was asked to respond to Mayor Michelle Wu’s defiance of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda.

“100% you will see a larger ICE presence,” Lyons told Carr.

As Lyons oversees ICE’s efforts to enact President Donald Trump’s mass deportation goals, federal officials are targeting “sanctuary” jurisdictions where policies limit the ways in which local police can cooperate with federal immigration agents. Boston is one of these places, and Wu has engaged in a monthslong feud with the Trump administration on the topic.

There is no one set legal definition of what makes a place a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The Department of Justice recently published a broad list of sanctuary jurisdiction criteria and named a number of cities, states, and counties that the federal government says have “policies that materially impede enforcement of federal immigration statutes and regulations.” Massachusetts as a whole is not on that list, but Boston is.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters to leaders of these jurisdictions, including to Wu, demanding that they abandon their sanctuary policies. Wu issued her response during a large press conference she convened outside City Hall on Tuesday.

“Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law,” the mayor said.

Carr played clips of Wu’s speech for Lyons and asked him if he would direct ICE to “surge” into Boston and Massachusetts in a similar manner to some of the enforcement activity taking place in Washington, D.C.

“We’re definitely going to, as you’ve heard the saying, ‘flood the zone,’ especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said.

He referenced a monthlong operation ICE conducted in Massachusetts in May, where almost 1,500 people were detained. Earlier in the year, ICE arrested some 370 people through an “enhanced operation” that federal officials directly blamed Wu and local sanctuary policies for.

Wu says that the city regularly works with federal law enforcement to find and detain people with criminal warrants. Lyons maintains that Wu and leaders like her are willingly releasing violent “criminal aliens” back onto city streets.

“We are going to continue to do our mission. We are going to keep making Boston safe, as she’s failing to do with the sanctuary policies,” Lyons said of Wu.

An ordinance known as the Boston Trust Act, which the City Council unanimously reaffirmed in anticipation of Trump’s return to the White House, is Boston’s sanctuary policy. It dictates that Boston police officers cannot ask individuals about their immigration status, make arrests based solely on ICE administrative warrants, or share certain information with ICE. It does allow the BPD to work with ICE on matters of “significant public safety importance,” like human trafficking, child exploitation, and cybercrimes.

Wu and many of her allies in the city say that the Trust Act improves public safety by allowing people to report crimes to the BPD without fearing that doing so could impact their immigration status.

Even if Wu or another Boston mayor were to abandon the Trust Act, state law would still limit how the BPD could interact with ICE. Under a 2017 Supreme Judicial Court decision, local authorities cannot detain someone just because federal immigration authorities believe they are subject to civil removal.

“In Boston we comply with and follow all of the laws: city, state, and federal. We will not back down from the communities who have made us the safest major city in the country,” Wu told reporters at an unrelated event Thursday when asked about Lyons’s comments.

Lyons, who previously served as the head of ICE’s Boston Field Office, told Carr that he still has many friends within the BPD that want to enthusiastically work with ICE but are worried about the repercussions if they do so.

“We have so many men and women on the Boston Police Department and other jurisdictions that are so pro-ICE, that want to work with us, and that are actually helping us behind the scenes,” he said.

Spokespeople for the BPD did not return requests for comment about Lyons’s remarks Thursday.

In June, the Wu administration began to formally request details on people being arrested by immigration agents in the city. ICE said publicly that it would comply.

However, Wu said this week that the agency is not responding to the city’s Freedom of Information Act requests. Boston is now filing an administrative appeal insisting that ICE produce the documents, and Wu said that her administration is prepared to use “every legal tool available” to get the public information.

“It’s been two months without a response and without the real facts,” she said Thursday.

The exact contours of what an increased ICE presence in Boston could entail are unclear. With the passage of Trump’s signature domestic policy legislation earlier this summer, ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency. The agency’s annual budget is set to increase from about $8 billion to about $28 billion. Those dollars will help it massively increase detention space, deportation flights, and staffing.

A hiring spree is underway, with ICE offering perks like hefty signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness. The agency’s official recruitment webpage claims that “America has been invaded by criminals and predators,” in its attempts to draw in new recruits.

The number of people detained by ICE nationally has steadily increased since Trump began his second term. About 70% of the current detainees do not have a criminal conviction, according to data compiled by analysts at Syracuse University through the use of public records requests.

The ministry said in a statement that the agreement had been concluded but that terms were still being worked out. It added that Uganda prefers that the migrants sent there be of African nationalities, but did not elaborate on what Uganda might get in return for accepting deportees.

The U.S. Embassy in Uganda declined to comment on what it called “diplomatic negotiations,” but said that diplomats were seeking to uphold President Trump’s “policy of keeping Americans safe.”

The Trump administration has been seeking ways to deter migrants from entering the country illegally and to deport those who already have done so, especially those with criminal records and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home country.

Human rights activists criticized the deportee deal as possibly going against international law.

Henry Okello Oryem, Uganda’s state minister for foreign affairs, on Wednesday had denied that any agreement on deportees had been reached, though he said his government was in discussions about “visas, tariffs, sanctions, and related issues.” He also suggested that his country would draw the line at accepting people associated with criminal groups.

“We are talking about cartels: people who are unwanted in their own countries. How can we integrate them into local communities in Uganda?” he said at the time.

Oryem and other Ugandan government officials declined to comment Thursday.

Opposition lawmaker Muwada Nkunyingi suggested that such a deal with the United States would give the Ugandan government legitimacy ahead of elections, and urged Washington not to turn a blind eye toward what he described as human rights and governance issues in Uganda.

Uganda’s leaders will rush into a deal to “clear their image now that we are heading into the 2026 elections,” Nkunyingi said.

Human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio likened a deportee deal to human trafficking, and said it would leave the status of the deportees unclear. “Are they refugees or prisoners?” he said.

“The proposed deal runs afoul of international law. We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,” he said. “That I can keep your prisoners if you pay me; how is that different from human trafficking?”

In July, the U.S. deported five men with criminal backgrounds to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini and sent eight more to South Sudan. The men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Vietnam sent to Eswatini are being held in solitary confinement until they can be deported to their home countries, which could take up to a year.

A legal challenge in the U.S had halted the deportation process of the eight men in South Sudan but a Supreme Court ruling eventually cleared the way for them to be sent to South Sudan.

Uganda has had challenges with the U.S. after lawmakers passed an anti-homosexuality bill in 2023 that punishes consensual same-sex conduct with penalties including life imprisonment. Washington threatened consequences and the World Bank withheld some funding.

Democrats have slammed Republicans for rejecting their attempts to conduct oversight at facilities where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold detained migrants awaiting deportation. Some state lawmakers were also denied entry to Alligator Alcatraz last month, the detention center in the Florida Everglades.

They have also been critical of President Trump’s robust immigration agenda, with turmoil rising after lawmakers joined with protestors outside an ICE center in New York earlier this year and anti-ICE protests sprung up in Southern California and beyond in opposition to an uptick in deportation raids after the administration sent National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles to quell demonstrations.

Families of those detained and human rights groups have said their loved ones are suffering from abuse while in ICE custody, such as a lack of clean water and electricity.

“We’re talking about pregnant women. We’re talking about children,” Ossoff told MSNBC’s Alicia Menendez. “We’re talking about people who have no business being in one of these horrible detention centers.”

“And, you know, I believe that the American people have rejected this draconian and inhumane approach to interior enforcement,” the lawmaker continued. “But in terms of my Republican colleagues, no spine is yet visible in the Senate.”

The Georgia Democrat also noted that the treatment is “indefensible” citing what he said is over 500 credible reports of abuses.

House and Senate Democrats joined forces to send a Wednesday letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem hoping to address the alleged injustices.

“Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, [DHS] has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health and violate federal law,” Democrats wrote in a letter to Noem inquiring about operations at Alligator Alcatraz.

A sanctuary jurisdiction is a city, county, or state that has implemented policies that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement, particularly ICE.
The hold gives ICE time to arrive and make a federal immigration arrest after local criminal proceedings are finished.

Amid a federal takeover late last week, the Trump administration reversed course and agreed to leave the police chief in control of the Metropolitan Police Department after city government officials filed a lawsuit. Still, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the district’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law, and the following day included immigration enforcement to their tasks. Six Republican-led states agreed to deploy their crop of federal troops to assist in Washington.

“I don’t think it’s even about crime. It’s about control and sliding towards authoritarianism,” Ronald Claude, director of policy and advocacy with the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, told Capital B. “It’s the same approach they did since 2016 when it comes to the border, saying there’s chaos at the border, the border is running amok. … Instead of actually looking at the data” to “further their own political objectives.”

The only increase in numbers is the amount of individuals ICE has detained, according to Claude and a July report published by the Prison Policy Initiative.

Last week’s orders from Bondi marked a shift from the police department’s previous stance as a sanctuary jurisdiction, in which law enforcement officers did not notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an undocumented person was charged with a crime or released from custody — actions that could have led to potential deportation.

“It’s all about deportation,” Claude said. “Instead of who feels unsafe walking outside their house. Instead of how much funding has gone into activities for teens after 5. Instead of how much has gone into homelessness, rent is going up every single year — we missed those issues.”

Trump’s federal takeover announcement also came within the same week that Bondi released a list of 35 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” which are cities, counties, and states accused of enacting policies that hinder federal immigration efforts. Bondi threatened legal action and to withhold victim compensation funds against these areas, signaling a replicated push that primarily targets Black and brown immigrant communities, many of whom are undocumented or presumed to be.

Those threats “clearly violate the 10th Amendment,” according to an analysis written by Spencer Reynolds, senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. The amendment, he said, “provides that powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states as independent sovereigns in our system of federalism.”

If this administration’s efforts in Washington are about “who provides safety and what is safety — and if you ask our communities like Black immigrants and Black folks — I guarantee you it is not seeing tanks coming through your streets or police that makes us feel safe,” Claude said.

So what does Bondi’s threat mean now for other mayors and Black families living in the district and beyond? Read on to find out.

What is a sanctuary jurisdiction, and has this kind of crackdown happened before?

This wasn’t the first time Trump and his attorney general have escalated its crackdown on what they deemed then as “sanctuary cities” or jurisdictions. A sanctuary jurisdiction is a city, county, or state that has implemented policies that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement, particularly ICE.

In 2020, following nationwide protests over George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police, officials used a legal loophole to deploy the National Guard to the district and sent unidentified federal agents to Portland, Oregon, leading to thousands of arrests, most of which were later dismissed.

Officials in places like New Jersey and Oregon labeled the Trump administration’s threats at the time as political theater — “bullying” and “election-year stunts.” In March 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Trump-era cases against sanctuary cities after former President Joe Biden’s Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Merrick Garland, withdrew the government’s support.

This time around, it took less than a week in August for Washington and other sanctuary locations to become direct targets for Trump. Two days after the Aug. 3 carjacking of a former Department of Government Ethics official, Bondi revealed the list, and by Aug. 8 Trump signed an executive order that temporarily deployed federal troops into the district.

“We have seen time and again that when law enforcement is militarized, it is our Black, Brown, and immigrant neighbors who suffer the most,” Guerline M. Jozef, founder and executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said in an Aug. 13 press release in response to Trump deploying the National Guard into Washington.

On Aug. 5, Bondi named 12 states and Washington, D.C., four counties — Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, and San Diego and San Francisco counties in California — and 18 cities in 10 states within communities that have a large population of documented and undocumented Black residents.

Additionally, Washington, D.C., was listed as a “state.” And the five boroughs — each a separate county — that make up New York City were not individually listed in the Justice Department’s county-level breakdown of sanctuary jurisdictions.

Claude said that other locations on the list must “keep fighting” as Boston Mayor Michelle Wu did, rejecting Bondi’s one-week deadline to respond to her letter of intent.

“This is not an option,” Claude said. “We’re imploring folks to go to your city council meetings, push your city council, push your town commissioner, if that’s what you have, your governor, your mayor, because they have a voice. They can do something. They can stand up.”

What is a 48-hour immigration hold?

A 48-hour immigration hold, also known as an ICE detainer, is a request from ICE to local law enforcement agencies, asking them to hold someone for up to 48 hours after they would otherwise be released from jail, so ICE can take custody for possible immigration enforcement.

This typically happens when a person under arrest, regardless of their socioeconomic status, is flagged as potentially removable due to their immigration status. The hold gives ICE time to arrive and make a federal immigration arrest after local criminal proceedings are finished.

Arrests now increasingly occur in jails and near courthouses. Two recent examples: Rony Dieujuste in Palm Beach, Florida, and Marlon Parris in Phoenix. Neither of those locations appears on the DOJ’s sanctuary jurisdiction list.

With three years remaining in the Trump administration, recent executive orders appear to disproportionately impact undocumented individuals, unhoused people, and residents of low-income communities — particularly those who are Black or Latino — compared with their white counterparts in similar circumstances, according to advocates and civil rights groups.

“President Trump speaks of poor and homeless people as if they are debris to be swept away, not human beings with dignity and dreams,” Jozef wrote in the Aug.13 press release. “Moving people without a real plan is not leadership — it’s cruelty dressed up as policy. This is the kind of dehumanization that turns poverty into a crime and erases the humanity of our most vulnerable neighbors.”

Are all immigration arrests happening in designated sanctuary jurisdictions?

While sanctuary jurisdictions have historically attempted to shield undocumented residents from deportation — often by refusing to detain people for ICE — federal and state law enforcement agencies are adapting.

“Many cities and states have tried to offer sanctuary for immigrants by refusing to rent jail space to ICE … but it is not enough,” Jacob Kang-Brown, author of Hiding in Plain Sight, a report published by the Prison Policy Initiative, said in a press release. The report reveals the role of locally run jails in Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

Bondi said in the Aug. 5 press release that several lawsuits had already been filed against local governments. These lawsuits demand that judges order jurisdictions to abandon their sanctuary policies and comply with Trump’s April executive order, which, in part, seeks to block undocumented people from receiving federal benefits.

In Louisville, Kentucky, under Democratic leadership, Mayor Craig Greenberg recently announced compliance with the DOJ’s demands, citing fear of losing millions in federal funds if kept on the list. In an interview with Spectrum News, Greenberg said the city would reinstate 48-hour courthouse holds.

Black people in the U.S. are arrested at 2.5 times the rate of their white counterparts, despite similar criminal activity rates, according to a report by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Once entangled in the criminal legal system, Black migrants are often flagged by ICE, creating a pathway from routine traffic stops to deportation proceedings. Among the most frequent forms of police contact leading to deportation are simple traffic violations.

Do sanctuary cities affect crime rates?

The simple answer is no.

Research released by the University of New Mexico this February shows that sanctuary cities do not have higher crime rates than non-sanctuary jurisdictions. But even in sanctuary cities, immigration enforcement remains a serious concern. Bondi said she sent letters of intent to the mayors of 35 such jurisdictions, giving them one week to respond and affirm that they will not obstruct federal deportation efforts.

As deportation efforts increase, those accused of overstaying their green cards, visas, or other forms of entry — regardless of their immigration status — must remain vigilant, advocates have said.

“It doesn’t make me feel safe when I look across the street at my neighbor, and you’re knocking on their door randomly to see their papers and to deport them or separate families,” Claude said. “That doesn’t keep anyone safe, and it causes more harm.”

“We reject it,” Jozef said in the Aug. 13 press release. “Our neighborhoods need increase[d] congressional funding, housing, healthcare, and humane immigration policies — not troops in the streets.”

These warnings are imperative, especially since simple traffic violations are among the most common reasons police come into contact with immigrants who later face deportation, according to a report by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.

Dieujuste, the Haitian immigrant who was living in Florida, was arrested following a traffic stop for allegedly driving under the influence.

“The Trump administration is leveraging jails at a new scale, using local contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service and existing policing practices in order to expand detention,” Kang-Brown said in the report’s press release.

The Prison Policy Initiative’s report revealed that ICE’s reported headcount of 57,200 detainees as of June is incomplete. The report found an additional 26,200 people held in jails and prisons for immigration-related reasons who were not included in ICE’s public records.",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2226825501-1-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-21 15:56:52.018651

But the judge, citing a Supreme Court decision last year that limited the power of agencies to rely on their own interpretations of the law, said the State Department’s historical tradition wasn’t entitled to deference.

The ruling came in a lawsuit filed in July on behalf of people from Afghanistan, Burma, Togo, Somalia and Iran who won the right to apply for visas under the so-called diversity visa program. The immigration lawyer who filed the case, Curtis Morrison, said he viewed the ruling as a mixed bag even though it doesn’t give his clients an immediate way to enter the U.S.

Morrison noted that the ban Trump issued in June, a reboot of similar policies he issued during his first term, promises that the latest policy will be reviewed by September. “There is a possibility that the ban goes away some day,” the attorney said.

In a press conference held Tuesday, the Tribe firmly denied the reports and issued a statement to clarify its stance on the controversial issue.

The clarification follows a Washington Post article that listed the Tribe’s land as one of three potential sites in Colorado for a facility to detain undocumented immigrants.

Here is the Southern Ute Indian Tribe’s statement:

The Southern Ute Indian Tribe (Tribe) is aware of recent media coverage regarding the expansion of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities across the country, including in the State of Colorado. We recognize that these reports have placed the Tribe at the center of a highly polarizing national issue, and we want to be clear: the Tribe has not entered into any agreement with ICE regarding detention operations.

The Tribe was surprised to learn of its inclusion in a planning document referenced by the Washington Post, which listed potential ICE facility sites. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), confirmed to the Washington Post that the document was created by ICE but is outdated and unapproved. The relationship between the Tribe and ICE has been mischaracterized. The Tribe was not notified nor consulted prior to the release of this information. It is important to note, there have been no discussions between Tribal Council and federal authorities on this matter.

The Southern Ute Indian Tribe remains committed to protecting the Tribal Membership and upholding its sovereignty. Any future consideration of detention-related arrangements would require Tribal Council approval and be guided by the Tribe’s core principles and values. The Tribe appreciates the opportunity to clarify its position and urges the public and media to respect the sovereignty and integrity of Tribal governance.

The appeals court, the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court, took an unusually long time to rule, weighing Trump’s appeal for nearly 11 months after oral arguments last fall.
Legal obstacles The civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.
The appeals court declined in June to reconsider.","Trump, in a social media post, claimed “total victory.”

“I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,” he wrote.

The decision came seven months after the Republican returned to the White House. A sharply divided panel of five judges in New York’s mid-level Appellate Division couldn’t agree on many issues raised in Trump’s appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive.”

After finding Trump flagrantly padded financial statements that went to lenders and insurers, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered him last year to pay $355 million in penalties. With interest, the sum has topped $515 million. Additional penalties levied on some other Trump Organization executives, including Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr. — bring the total to $527 million, with interest.

An ‘excessive’ fine

“While the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants’ business culture, the court’s disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” Judges Dianne T. Renwick and Peter H. Moulton wrote in one of three opinions shaping the appeals court’s ruling.

Engoron’s other punishments, upheld by the appeals court, have been on pause during Trump’s appeal, and the president was able to hold off collection of the money by posting a $175 million bond.

The court, which split on the merits of the lawsuit and Engoron’s fraud finding, dismissed the penalty in its entirety while also leaving a pathway for an appeal to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. Trump and his co-defendants, the judges wrote, can seek to extend the pause on any punishments taking effect.

The panel was sharply divided, issuing 323 pages of concurring and dissenting opinions with no majority. Rather, some judges endorsed parts of their colleagues’ findings while denouncing others, enabling the court to rule.

Two judges wrote that they felt New York Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit against Trump and his companies was justifiable and that she had proven her case but the penalty was too severe. One wrote that James exceeded her legal authority in bringing the suit, saying that if any of Trump’s lenders felt cheated, they could have sued him themselves, and none did. One judge wrote that Engoron erred by ruling before the trial began that the attorney general had proved Trump engaged in fraud.

In his portion of the ruling, Judge David Friedman, who was appointed to the court by Republican Gov. George Pataki, was scathing in his criticism of James for bringing the lawsuit.

“Plainly, her ultimate goal was not ‘market hygiene’ … but political hygiene, ending with the derailment of President Trump’s political career and the destruction of his real estate business,” Friedman wrote. “The voters have obviously rendered a verdict on his political career. This bench today unanimously derails the effort to destroy his business.”

In a statement, James focused on the part of the case that went her way, saying the court had “affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud.”

“It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,” James said.

The appeals court, the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court, took an unusually long time to rule, weighing Trump’s appeal for nearly 11 months after oral arguments last fall. Normally, appeals are decided in a matter of weeks or a few months.

Claims of politics at play

Trump and his co-defendants denied wrongdoing. At the conclusion of the civil trial in January 2024, Trump said he was “an innocent man” and the case was a “fraud on me.” The Republican has repeatedly maintained the case and the verdict were political moves by James and Engoron, both Democrats.

Trump’s Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to the lawsuit, among other documents, as part of an investigation into whether she violated the president’s civil rights. James’ personal attorney Abbe D. Lowell has said investigating the fraud case is “the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign.”

Trump and his lawyers said his financial statements weren’t deceptive, since they came with disclaimers noting they weren’t audited. The defense also noted bankers and insurers independently evaluated the numbers, and the loans were repaid.

Despite such discrepancies as tripling the size of his Trump Tower penthouse, he said the financial statements were, if anything, lowball estimates of his fortune.

During an appellate court hearing last September, Trump’s lawyers argued that many of the case’s allegations were too old and that James had misused a consumer protection law to sue Trump over private business transactions that were satisfactory to those involved.

State attorneys said that while Trump insists no one was harmed by the financial statements, his exaggerations led lenders to make riskier loans and that honest borrowers lose out when others game their net worth numbers.

Legal obstacles

The civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.

On Jan. 10, he was sentenced in his criminal hush money case to what’s known as an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction on the books but sparing him jail, probation, a fine or other punishment. He is appealing the conviction.

And in December, a federal appeals court upheld a jury’s finding that Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and later defamed her, affirming a $5 million judgment against him. The appeals court declined in June to reconsider. Trump still can try to get the Supreme Court to hear his appeal.

Trump also is appealing a subsequent verdict that requires him to pay Carroll $83.3 million for additional defamation claims.

Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.

The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.

As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.

But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.

The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

Trump’s moves also fly in the face of another truth: Crime is no bigger an issue in DC than it is anywhere else in the United States.
Washington, DC, is a great stage for beta-testing how willing the rest of the US is to go to achieve Trump’s dream of autocratic rule.
So, it is not that surprising Trump would attempt such heavy-handed tactics in a soft occupation of DC, particularly in a city that was once famously nicknamed “Chocolate City”.
But what Trump is doing to DC in 2025 is not quite unprecedented – not for him, and not for the federal government.","Washington, DC, youth activist Afeni Evans has become the most recent symbol of US President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the city’s police.

On August 15, Metro Transit Police officers pepper-sprayed and forced the 28-year-old Evans to the ground at the Navy Yard subway stop for allegedly committing fare evasion. Evans and other Harriet’s Wildest Dreams volunteers were at the station on “cop watch” to ensure the federal takeover would not lead to harassment of Black youth. Yet, it happened to three Black youths anyway, prompting Evans to intervene, which led to her arrest.

After public protests in DC and on social media, she was released to cheering crowds outside the court, and the charges against her were dropped the next day.

Like with so many other issues related to Trump and his attempts at autocracy, his use of the National Guard and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to stifle community ecosystems especially impacts Washington’s Black, Brown and Queer residents. This effort to squash potential dissent is more than a distraction from the Epstein files controversy or America’s economic troubles.

Locally, it is a partial end to the District of Columbia’s half-century of home rule, which otherwise makes the city independent of direct federal oversight. Nationally, it is an open question about whether DC can remain a site of protest, a place where marches and other gatherings can effect change or even occur at all in the current autocratic climate.

Trump’s executive order announcing his takeover of DC’s police force on August 11 should not have come as a surprise, especially given his attempts to bring the federal government’s power to bear in California back in June. “Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia”, the order reads, stating that the “increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic… poses intolerable risks to the vital federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”.

But the truth is, Trump’s executive order manufactured a crisis out of far-right fantasies. Six days before Trump’s announcement, two teenagers carjacked Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old former staffer at the Department of Government Efficiency, in DC’s Logan Circle. “We’re going to do something about it. That includes bringing in the National Guard,” Trump said in the aftermath of the incident.

However, the two alleged carjackers in police custody were from Hyattsville, Maryland, in Prince George’s County, and not DC.

Trump’s moves also fly in the face of another truth: Crime is no bigger an issue in DC than it is anywhere else in the United States. At the beginning of the year, a joint report from the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) showed that the city’s violent crime rate had dropped by 35 percent in 2024, reaching its lowest rate since the mid-1990s. “Armed carjackings are down 53%,” according to the report.

Washington, DC, is a great stage for beta-testing how willing the rest of the US is to go to achieve Trump’s dream of autocratic rule. DC remains a majority-minority city, with Black Washingtonians making up a plurality (43 percent) of the population, despite 30 years of middle-class (mostly white) gentrification – white Washingtonians make up 39 percent of DC’s population.

So, it is not that surprising Trump would attempt such heavy-handed tactics in a soft occupation of DC, particularly in a city that was once famously nicknamed “Chocolate City”. In a capital where more than 90 percent of voters chose former Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, Trump is also sending the unvarnished and racist message that Black folk, and especially Black youth, are criminals.

Imposing a heightened police presence and hundreds of National Guard soldiers on a multiracial city is nothing but a wannabe strongman’s attempt to appear strong to his anti-Black supporters.

DC is also known as a place that holds significance for Queer Americans. One out of every seven adults in the nation’s capital identifies as LGBTQIA+, roughly 80,000 Washingtonians in all. Northwest DC, particularly communities like Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Adams Morgan, and parts of Shaw and Columbia Heights, became a relatively safe space in the 1960s and 1970s for Queer culture and businesses to thrive. The inaugural National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights began in DC in 1979.

It should not shock anyone that an anti-Queer Trump administration would also target DC’s Queer and migrant spaces. The federalised police presence in DC has been especially noticeable along the 14th Street and U Street corridors, including the installation of not-so-random checkpoints over the past couple of weeks. Inevitably – between the National Guard, federal law enforcement and anti-immigrant agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in conjunction with the MPD – they have made dozens of arrests, and smothered nightlife and business traffic in these communities.

Trump, in his own ham-fisted way, is also attempting to erase DC’s history as one of protest and resistance. As the US evolved into a superpower, and DC transformed into the international community’s superpower city during and after World War II, the city also became a place for protest, particularly for racial justice and civil rights. Examples include the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, as well as a series of antiwar protests against Vietnam between 1965 and 1971. Marches and protests for the Equal Rights Amendment, for a Gay Rights Bill, for Chicano rights, Indigenous rights, and migrant and refugee rights came alongside civil rights marches and protests throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Massive protests like the 2017 Women’s March, the George Floyd protests in 2020 and the Free Palestine protests last year have made DC a target ripe for government overreach.

But what Trump is doing to DC in 2025 is not quite unprecedented – not for him, and not for the federal government. In 2018, during Trump’s first term as president, the US National Park Service (NPS) sought to shrink the available sidewalk space around the White House for protests “by 80 percent”, and to charge demonstrators permit fees “to allow the NPS to recover some of the costs” of public safety provisions. On June 1, 2020, the National Guard and the US Park Police tear-gassed, lobbed concussion grenades and violently arrested George Floyd protesters at Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House – all so that Trump could do a photo-op nearby on the steps of St John’s Church, calling himself “your president of law and order” along the way.

Trump has followed in the footsteps of another “law and order” president, Richard Nixon. In May 1971, Nixon unleashed the National Guard and local police against thousands of antiwar demonstrators in DC, in what became known as the Mayday protests, leading to more than 12,000 arrests over a three-day period.

In 1932, President Herbert Hoover authorised the use of military force against a ragtag group of 20,000 unemployed and unhoused World War I veterans known as the Bonus Army. At the height of the Great Depression and looking for the bonus money Congress owed them, the military responded with gas grenades, bayonets, flamethrowers and tanks, destroying their shantytowns along the National Mall and Anacostia River. Two veterans died, while the Army injured thousands of others. The resulting tear gas cloud over the city also led to the death of an infant.

Trump and his small army of occupiers are trying to make an example out of the nation’s capital, to destroy the DC of the past century, its vibrancy and resistance. The irony, of course, is that one of Trump’s first acts in his second term was to pardon more than 1,500 insurrectionists who had been part of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a deadly and treasonous event.

Now, Trump wants to cower Washingtonians into accepting autocracy.

DC’s legacy as the national seat of power, as an international city, and as the centre of the so-called Free World, is in peril.

According to city officials and eyewitnesses, at least three Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests occurred this week, with no advance warning and little public explanation from federal authorities. The arrests — two on Tuesday morning and one on Monday — took place in public spaces, including a construction site and a bus stop, in an area known for its high immigrant population.

""This has long been a heavily immigrant community,” said Alexandria City Councilman Canek Aguirre, who visited the sites where the arrests happened. “But ICE doesn't exactly tell us what they're doing, and we’ve definitely seen an uptick in cases the past week or two.”

One of the arrests occurred at the Eaton Square apartment complex on Monday around lunchtime. Aguirre says several construction workers were taken while working on a roof.

“Their food was still there, the equipment, the vehicle was left wide open,” he said. “We don't even know who these folks were, where they were taken, or where they went.”

Video footage shared with WUSA9 shows two more arrests Tuesday morning — one at a bus stop on Glebe Road around 9:30 a.m. and another shortly after back at Eaton Square.

Evelin Urrutia, executive director of Tenants and Workers United, confirmed her organization is tracking at least three cases.

“These arrests are not targeting criminals, they're targeting workers,” she said. “There’s a lot of panic, but our community is strong. Still, this is affecting everyone — schools, families, the whole city.”

Councilman Aguirre criticized what he called “unconstitutional tactics,” particularly as arrests could happen during school dismissal.

“Imagine you’re picking up your kid from school or waiting for the bus to get to work, and you’re suddenly surrounded,” he said. “You’re basically profiling people at that point.”

“We’re definitely going to … flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons told “The Howie Carr Show” on Wednesday.

“Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary. Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger ICE presence.”

It comes after the city’s mayor on Tuesday publicly rejected Attorney General Pam Bondi’s ultimatum to ax its sanctuary city law — or risk cuts to federal funding.

“Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law, and Boston will not back down from who we are or what we stand for. We will not back away from our community that has made us the safest city in the country,” Wu bellowed at a raucous press conference.

Lyons slammed the mayor’s resistance, insisting Boston’s sanctuary status was only making the streets more dangerous given that local cops can ignore ICE detainers — illegal migrants convicted of crimes can essentially be cut loose back into the community.

“That’s the issue we’re seeing in so many jurisdictions,” Lyons said.

“We have so many men and women on the Boston Police Department and other jurisdictions that are so pro-ICE, that want to work with us and that are actually helping us behind the scenes.”

“That’s what I think local leaders don’t understand, is they need to talk to the men and women on the ground, because … there are so many of these criminal aliens that keep getting released to go out and commit more crimes that the local law enforcement have to deal with.

The Pentagon declined to specify how many civilian employees are expected to participate in the program.","The Pentagon is recruiting civilian employees to join Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign and asking staff to sign up for deployments to immigration enforcement facilities across the United States.

The defense department has posted a job listing requesting volunteers for civilian federal employees apply to join a “volunteer force” supporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations. On Wednesday, the department reportedly emailed civilian employees asking them to take up this opportunity.

“The Secretary of Defense has authorized DoD civilian employees to participate in details to the Department of Homeland Security to contribute to its operations along the Southern Border and its internal immigration enforcement activities,” reads the email, obtained by 404Media. Roughly 950,000 civilian employees work for the Pentagon.

Selected employees will reportedly “offer critical support” to Ice and the border patrol “as they fulfill the President’s intent to ensure a safe and orderly immigration system”.

A US defense official confirmed the initiative, telling the Guardian: “The Secretary of Defense memorandum signed on Jun 1, 2025, ‘Detailing of Department of Defense Civilians Employees to Support the Department of Homeland Security’ allows DoD civilians employees to participate in a detail for up to 180-days, supporting the Department of Homeland Security’s operations on the southern border.”

The official said volunteer duties may include “data entry, operational planning support, processing and throughput logistics, and logistical support”.

The job posting warns deployment locations “are not negotiable” and conditions “could be austere”. Assignments last up to 180 days at facilities along the border and throughout the US interior, and detailing means the staff keeps their salary and benefits.

The recruitment effort stems from a June memorandum issued by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, that authorizes the civilian employee deployments “in support of the President’s priority of securing our borders”. The memo specifically enables both reimbursable and non-reimbursable details to DHS for southern border operations and “internal immigration enforcement”.

The Pentagon initiative comes as the Trump administration works to expand immigration enforcement personnel, infrastructure and operations across the country. The Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by Trump last month, includes budget for an additional 10,000 Ice agents, and Ice is reportedly offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 and has reduced its age requirements in an effort to expand its forces.

Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported that DHS had reassigned dozens of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) employees to Ice.

Meanwhile, new detention facilities are being established in Nebraska, Florida and at military installations including Fort Bliss in Texas, which now houses migrants in tent structures with capacity for 5,000 people.

Ice arrests have surged nationwide, with northern California seeing a 123% increase in detentions between January and July compared to late 2024.

The administration has also begun deploying Ice agents alongside local police for routine traffic enforcement. In Washington DC, federal immigration agents now accompany police officers during moped traffic stops targeting food delivery drivers, most of whom are from Central or South America, according to reporting from the Washington Post.

The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, announced last week that approximately 1.6 million undocumented immigrants had left the US during her first 200 days in office, citing agency data. There is also a planned $20-50m ad buy dubbed “Stronger Border, Stronger America” to promote the work of the DHS set to launch in September.

The salary range for the volunteer positions spans from approximately $25,684 to $191,900 annually, with assignments requiring 76% or greater travel and no remote work options available, according to the job listing. Relocation expenses will not be reimbursed.

Agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) descended on the warehouse, in Edison, New Jersey, at 9am on Wednesday, the New York Times reported. Officers led some workers away in zip ties, employees told the Times, while people they deemed to have legal status in the US were given yellow wristbands.

Univision reported that the agents spent hours at the facility, during what CBP said was a “surprise inspection”. CBP told Univision the operation had begun as part of “routine efforts” to verify customs, employment and safety regulations.

CBP did not immediately respond to questions from the Guardian.

Videos taken by New Labor, a New Jersey-based labor and immigration reform organization, showed CBP vehicles at the site, along with unmarked SUVs. New Labor said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents were also at the raid.

“We have customs and border patrol [sic] holding the door open for their Ice counterparts to say they’re allowed in with us, and then they start doing immigration-related actions,” Amanda Dominguez, an organizer at New Labor, told News 12 New York.

“That is illegal. Ice still needs their own judicial warrant signed by a judge.”

Relatives of the workers gathered at the facility throughout the day, the Times reported, waiting for news about people inside.

“People were very upset and crying and angry, completely understandably,” said Ellen Whit, who works at Deportation & Immigrant Response Equipo (Dire), a New Jersey hotline that responds to calls about raids and from relatives of immigrants who have been detained, told the Times. “One girl’s father was taken. She was very, very upset.”

Workers described a chaotic scene as federal agents arrived. About 20 agents entered through the front door of the warehouse, witnesses told the Times, while other agents blocked alternative exits. Some people were injured amid the chaos, while others hid in the rafters of the warehouse for hours in an attempt to avoid the officers.

An analysis of new census data released on Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that between January and June, the foreign-born population in the United States — both lawful and unlawful residents — declined by nearly 1.5 million. In June, the country was home to 51.9 million immigrants, down from 53.3 million six months earlier.

Officials from the Trump administration have applauded the net outflow, asserting that pressures on government services have eased and that job markets have rebounded. And some supporters of the immigration crackdown say it hasn’t gone far enough.

But experts predict looming negative economic and demographic consequences for the United States if the trend persists. Immigrants are a critical work force in many sectors, and the country’s reliance on them is growing as more baby boomers retire.

After campaigning on a promise of mass deportations, Mr. Trump has introduced sweeping measures to reduce immigration. His administration has restricted access to asylum at the southern border, tightened visa requirements for students and tech workers and deployed thousands of federal agents to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The crackdown has led immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and has discouraged others from coming.

Lillian Divina Leite, 46, chose to use the government’s new self-deportation program to return to Brazil. A housekeeper in Charlotte, N.C., Ms. Leite said that she had begun to panic when she saw immigrants being “hunted down like hardened criminals.”

“I got really scared,” said Ms. Leite, who had fallen out of legal status after overstaying a six-month tourist visa.

“I thought, I haven’t done anything wrong in my life,” she said, “and suddenly I could be imprisoned.”

Despite the study’s findings, Kevin Lynn, executive director of the Institute for Sound Public Policy, which advocates for less immigration, said that foreign workers who enter lawfully continue to pour into the United States and undermine Americans.

“There has been no letup,” he said. “People coming here legally, whether on green cards or employment visas, are impacting American workers at all strata, whether low-skilled or high-skilled.”

Net migration — the difference between the number of immigrants arriving and departing — has turned negative, a shift that the chief Pew demographer, Jeffrey Passel, called a “demographic certainty” so far in 2025. His team’s analysis did not calculate a separate number for undocumented immigrants, who seem likely to represent the largest number of departures, because heightened enforcement probably diminished immigrants’ participation in the census survey that was used to make estimates, he said.

They may have been undercounted, which would suggest the drop is not as severe, or their low participation could mask an even more striking decline.

The United States experienced negative net immigration in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, when between 400,000 and one million Mexicans and Mexican Americans left, many under coercive repatriation programs.

Whether negative net migration becomes a lasting phenomenon depends on how far the Trump administration goes to achieve its goals, experts say, but the Pew findings echo trends identified by other recent studies.

In July, the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute projected net migration in 2025 would be flat or would even drop and predicted that the Trump administration’s policies would continue to squeeze out low- and high-skilled foreign workers at least through 2026.

“A rapid decline in immigration is going to cause economic harm,” said Tara Watson, an economist at the Brookings Institution and one of the authors of the report.

Political pushback and legal challenges could lead the Trump administration to ease its crackdown and, thus, soften the impact, she said. But legislation recently passed by the Republican-controlled Congress has significantly increased funding for immigration enforcement, suggesting that the restrictive approach could extend throughout Mr. Trump’s term.

If so, “we could go into a spiral of continued decline,” said Ms. Watson, which could undermine U.S. competitiveness for global talent.

“If things are really bad, we no longer are the place where people go to do science or tech, and that could have generational repercussions,” she said.

On Day 1 in office, Mr. Trump signed several immigration-related orders. Since then, his administration has intensified efforts to curb immigration, and the president recently celebrated the prospect of negative net migration.

As he wrote in a Truth Social post on Aug. 4: “Promises made. Promises kept. Negative net migration for the first time in 50 years!”

In addition to targeting undocumented migrants, the administration has introduced measures that have undermined legal immigration.

It has paused the refugee program, which offered green cards and a path to citizenship to people fleeing persecution. It has increased screening and vetting of visa applicants, which experts expect will reduce the numbers of foreign workers and students.

The Trump administration has ended several Biden-era programs that had allowed people from troubled countries such as Haiti to live and work temporarily in the United States. Thousands of immigrants are set to lose their protected status in coming months.

Migration across the southern border, which had begun to slow under asylum restrictions imposed late in the term of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has declined further since Mr. Trump returned to office.

Employment opportunities have long been the primary draw for immigrants, with migration typically slowing during economic downturns. During the Great Recession, more Mexicans without authorized status left the United States than arrived.

But the current decline is unfolding in response to stringent policies and at a time when the United States needs immigration to offset a falling birthrate and an aging population.

“We have more and more people over 65 and not in the work force,” said Dowell Myers, a demography professor at the University of Southern California. “A new baby won’t help us for 20 years, but a young immigrant helps us immediately.”

“If you take a sledgehammer to the labor force by cutting immigrant flows,” he said, “we are all going to be seeing the consequences in our everyday lives.”

Restaurants, farms and assisted-living facilities are already grappling with labor shortages that could become more pronounced, he said. Many of those roles are filled by undocumented immigrants, whose population reached 14 million in 2023, according to Pew, and who accounted for 4 percent of the total U.S. population and about a quarter of the foreign-born population.

California had the most unauthorized residents in 2023, at 2.3 million, followed closely by Texas, with 2.1 million. Florida had the largest increase, adding 700,000 for a total of 1.6 million.

Through mid-2024, the unauthorized population continued to grow at a fast clip, before starting to contract following policy changes in 2025, according to a preliminary Pew analysis.

About half of the 14 million undocumented immigrants in 2023 had been in the United States for more than a decade, and 4.6 million U.S.-born children have parents who are in the country without lawful status.

Pew’s estimates are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data, including the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said last week in a news release that a decline in the population of undocumented immigrants “is already being felt nationwide, from reduced strain on public services to a resurgence in local job markets.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is holding a record 60,000 immigrants in detention, and that number is expected to soar as planned facilities open. Confined immigrants often agree to be swiftly deported rather than languish in custody while awaiting court rulings on whether they can remain in the United States.

Patrick Garcia, executive director of Embrace Carolinas, an advocacy group in Charlotte, N.C., is aware of at least 10 families who have self-deported to South and Central America.

“Something that was rare has become normal,” he said, adding that “my prediction is that departures will increase as Christmas and winter approach.”

“People are making as much money as they can to leave by the end of the year,” Mr. Garcia said.

Cratchit Aime, a Haitian immigrant in Springfield, Ohio, said he intended to return with his family to Brazil, where they had previously lived, to avoid being deported to his homeland.

Finally, on June 16, she received a call. Ms. Leite was booked on a United Airlines flight leaving on July 2 to São Paulo through Chicago. She landed in Brazil on July 3.

About two weeks later, she took delivery of $1,000 via Western Union.

“It’s a huge relief to be back home,” she said, adding that “police sirens still make me nervous.”

On social media, she has been busy offering tips for people who are eager to self-deport.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21nat-immig-decline-top-jfmc/21nat-immig-decline-top-jfmc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 12:11:33.479968

This is the third confirmed immigration arrest near a San Diego County School this month.

Federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested a man at the intersection of Park Dale Lane and Village Parkway around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. The man was on his way to work.

A video shared by the North County advocacy group Alianza Comunitaria shows bystanders asking to see an arrest warrant identifying the man. In the background, an agent said, ""It's a different guy.""

Later in the video, a bystander said, ""You said there would be a warrant."" The ICE agent responded, ""Not for him.""

Another video shows agents forcing the man into a truck as his wife and young daughter cry out for him.

Encinitas Union School District officials condemned the arrest. In a letter to parents, officials confirmed the man’s daughter is a student in the district.

“We are alarmed and disturbed by this event and its impact on children and families,” the district’s letter said.

State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, D-Encinitas, and Congressman Mike Levin, D-49, criticized ICE for the arrest.

Blakespear called it, “inhumane, barbaric and lawless,” while Levin demanded ICE provide, “a full and immediate explanation.”

The agency did not immediately respond to questions from KPBS.

As the videos circulated online, neighbors raised more than $25,000 so far to cover the family’s legal and basic living expenses through a crowdsourcing website.

“This working father and his family needs support from our community,” the fundraiser states.

Wednesday morning’s arrest is at least the third time federal immigration agents have arrested people near local schools. Similar enforcement tactics happened in Chula Vista and Linda Vista. News reports show similar arrests near schools in Oregon, Texas, Illinois and South Carolina.

In January, President Donald Trump rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected schools, churches and hospitals from immigration enforcement.

At least one protester was detained, and two people, including a journalist, were hit with pepper spray by federal immigration officers Wednesday morning after a standoff outside the agency’s San Francisco office became violent.

Protesters first faced off with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers outside the nearby immigration courthouse at 100 Montgomery St. after officers arrested a man inside.

“Why are you disappearing our community?” one protester yelled as officers guided the man into a waiting van and began to drive away.

The protest escalated, spreading to the Financial District ICE field office, which is often used as a holding facility for immigrants detained across the Bay Area.

One protester outside ICE’s Sansome Street office was tackled, zip-tied and taken inside shortly after about a dozen people, who followed officers on foot the half-mile from the immigration court, arrived.

Minutes earlier, as the group walked toward the office, an officer pepper-sprayed both a protester and a journalist.

About two blocks north of the immigration court, Gazetteer reporter Eddie Kim told KQED he was sprayed in the eyes while trying to record an altercation between an ICE officer and a protester. He said a person rolling a bicycle alongside the group was walking calmly when an ICE officer reached out and grabbed hold of the bike’s handle.

The officer then sprayed the protester and Kim with a pepper spray gel.

“It wasn’t provoked,” Kim told KQED. “It’s not like the bike was being moved to hit the agent or get in their way. It was just a person just walking with the group … There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene.”

Altercations between ICE and protesters outside the downtown court and field office have grown increasingly common since federal agents began arresting asylum seekers reporting to the buildings for mandatory status hearings and check-in appointments — a tactic that was unheard of until earlier this year.

In recent weeks, officers have also detained multiple protesters as tensions have escalated. Last Friday, two people were pinned to the ground and handcuffed before being walked into the Financial District ICE office.

“It’s also very clear that when people mobilize, it affects ICE in a major way,” Kim said. “They’re clearly affected by the presence of protesters to the point where they’re willing to deploy force against people who are not even an active threat.”

After hearing reports around 8:30 a.m., Wednesday, that a man had been arrested inside the immigration court building, protesters first gathered outside on Montgomery Street, standing in the way of the building’s lower-profile side door in an attempt to block ICE officers’ path to a line of waiting vans.

One protester who refused to stand back from the door was shoved to the ground, while another was pushed away toward the street.

Masked officers exited the building with the detained man, who was dressed in a suit and had his hands secured behind his back. They escorted him to the vehicle as protesters yelled for them to stop.

Protesters popped a front tire of the van before it took off south down Montgomery Street, along with two other vehicles. One officer yelled that a protester who ran down the street had a knife, and the officer reached for his gun but did not unholster it.

At least 20 protesters moved into the streets and crosswalks surrounding the court building, attempting to block the vans’ path. Some held bicycles and others stood in front of cars, trying to keep them in place.

An ICE officer shot a weapon, producing a white powder into the leg of a protester jostling with others over a bike.

At the same time, the dozen or so people who migrated to Sansome Street began to head north, some running in the street.

Following the protester’s detention at the field office, many of the protesters who had traveled to Sansome Street dispersed. Others remained at the courthouse on Montgomery Street midmorning.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/250820-ICE-ACTIVITY-JCL-03-KQED.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 10:51:55.411741

We're going to keep making America safe,” Lyons said Wednesday in an interview on the ""Howie Carr Show.""

Asked if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning something similar to President Donald Trump's recent takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., Lyons said there would definitely be more of an ICE presence in Boston in the wake of Wu's comments this week.

“We’re definitely going to … flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said. “Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary. Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger ICE presence.”

Patricia Hyde, Boston's acting ICE field office director, also spoke Wednesday about Wu's comments, appearing in an interview on Fox News.

""Sanctuary policies don't make anyone safer, they don't make the community safer,"" she said. ""As far as, you know, the City of Boston and Mayor Wu not backing down, the men and women of ICE are not backing down.""

""I know what a safe Boston looks like, and this isn't it,"" Hyde added. ""This is a public safety crisis. Sanctuary policies don't make anyone safer... The men and women of ICE, unlike Mayor Wu, we took an oath and we swore to uphold our oath to protect the cities and communities where we work and where we live, and that's what we're going to do, despite the obstacles.""

Wu posted a response to Hyde's comments on Bluesky on Thursday morning, saying ""Actually I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States with my hand on @bpl.boston.gov's 1782 edition Aitken Bible--also known as the Bible of the Revolution.""

The U.S. Department of Justice sent out letters last week giving Boston and other sanctuary cities until Aug. 19 to submit a plan of compliance. The agency threatened to pull federal funding and even file civil suits if Boston did not comply.

Wu released her written response on Tuesday morning and held a press conference at City Hall Plaza, flanked by other local leaders, including U.S. Sen. Ed Markey.

""Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,"" Wu said. ""Boston will not back down from who we are and what we stand for.""

In her letter, Wu said that the courts have consistently held that local public safety laws like the Boston Trust Act, which prohibits local police from working with federal agents if there is not a criminal warrant, are ""valid exercises of local authority and fully consistent with federal law.""

In the latest case, armed men in bulletproof vests arrested a father in front of an Encinitas elementary school Wednesday morning while his young daughter watched, officials said.

In a video of the incident posted to Instagram by a parent group, the men, at least one with his face covered, can be seen pulling a man dressed in a neon orange safety shirt and work boots out of a pickup truck.

The incident occurred at Park Dale Lane Elementary in Village Park, at 7:30 a.m., after the father had left the drop-off line, local officials said. During the arrest, bystanders asked the agents for a warrant signed by a judge; they apparently did not provide one.

The men making the arrest wore labels on their vests that referred to federal agencies. One was marked “ERO,” which is the acronym for Enforcement and Removal Operations, an arm of ICE. Other vests said “ATF,” the acronym for another federal law enforcement agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the arrest.

In a statement, state Senator Catherine Blakespear said the men making the arrest “appear to be federal police working for ICE” but they did not show identification, and they gave no reason for the arrest. The man had just pulled over to drop his daughter at school, Blakespear said, when agents “abruptly separated him from his child and family.”

“This is inhumane, barbaric, and lawless. We should all be outraged,” Blakespear said. She referred to the current state of the country as a “police state… where any person can be apprehended on the street without probable cause for arrest.”

Andrée Grey, the superintendent of the Encinitas Union School District, said in a statement that the arrest, which was witnessed by parents, students and school staff, had caused an atmosphere of “fear and trauma.” Grey said the district’s policy is to not share any information with authorities unless through a court order or judicial subpoena.

In a statement posted to social media, the Parents of Encinitas Union School District said the man’s daughter “has suffered a life-altering loss” and is “a victim of policy.” The group posted a gofundme link to help the family.

If the arrest is immigration-related, it marks a pattern of at least three incidents outside schools in San Diego County in the last two weeks.

On August 6, ICE arrested a woman while she was dropping off her child at Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista, and on August 14, ICE made a similar arrest of a father outside Linda Vista Elementary.

After the Linda Vista raid, ICE responded to Times of San Diego and said that any rumors that ICE agents were targeting the school were “smears.” School superintendents argue that even if the arrests happen just outside school grounds, instead of on school property, their proximity still deeply affects the community.

On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing ICE to make arrests in schools, churches and hospitals, areas that had previously been off-limits to protect essential services and prevent disruptions for children.

In a statement responding to the arrest at Park Dale Lane Elementary posted on social media, U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, D-Carlsbad, said that raids at schools like this one are “wrong and unacceptable,” and that he had personally asked the Department of Homeland Security to cease this practice. “No child should face that fear, particularly not when being dropped off at school,” he said.

When a parent is deported, a family may face a choice of whether a child will stay with a qualified family member in the U.S., move to a foreign country or enter the child welfare system.

Speaking on “The Howie Carr Show” Wednesday, Lyons said his response to Wu’s stated intention to defy the federal order is that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly referred to as ICE, is “going to keep making Boston safe, as she’s failing to do with the sanctuary city policies.”

“We did Operation Patriot March which yielded over 1,000 arrests, and now you’re going to see more ICE agents come to Boston to make sure that we take these public threats out that she wants to let go back in the communities,” Lyons said. “We’re going to keep making America safe.”

Asked by Carr if ICE was planning to “surge” the city of Boston akin to President Donald Trump’s crime crackdown in Washington, D.C, where ICE agents have reportedly appeared alongside the National Guard and federal agents, Lyons said there would be a larger presence in Boston following Wu’s remarks on Tuesday.

“We’re definitely going to … flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said. “Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary. Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger ICE presence.”

Lyons’ radio interview represented one of the first indications of how the Trump administration is reacting to a defiant press conference held by Mayor Wu on City Hall Plaza Tuesday, when she stated that the city has no intention of complying with Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order to dismantle its local sanctuary law.

“The U.S. Attorney General asked for a response today, so here it is,” Wu said at the press conference. “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law, and Boston will not back down from who we are or what we stand for. We will not back away from our community that has made us the safest city in the country.”

Bondi had given Wu a Tuesday deadline to respond to a letter she sent last week to leaders of cities and states identified by the Department of Justice as sanctuary jurisdictions, with an order to “eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal law enforcement.”

In Boston, the law on the books enshrining its sanctuary status since 2014 is the Trust Act, which prohibits local police and other city departments from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when it comes to detaining illegal immigrants on civil warrants.

City officials say the law still allows for local cooperation with the feds on certain criminal matters like drug, weapons and human trafficking.

But Lyons said ICE has been finding that the state of Massachusetts, including Boston, has been ignoring ICE detainers or releasing “criminal aliens” convicted of crimes in the United States and abroad back into society, while again referencing the nearly 1,500 illegal immigrant arrests made during Operation Patriot.

“So not only do we have to go ahead and go after the ones we were targeting, but we have to also deal with jurisdictions releasing criminal aliens in real time while we’re out there working the streets,” Lyons said. “It’s not making anyone safer.”

Lyons also stated that Boston Police, while prohibited in some instances from cooperating with ICE by way of the city’s Trust Act, is often helping federal authorities “behind the scenes,” unbeknownst to Mayor Wu.

Those Boston police officers can’t cooperate openly with ICE out of fear of “getting in trouble or getting fired,” Lyons said.

“That’s the issue we’re seeing in so many jurisdictions,” Lyons said. “We have so many men and women on the Boston Police Department and other jurisdictions that are so pro-ICE, that want to work with us and that are actually helping us behind the scenes.

“And that’s what I think local leaders don’t understand, is they need to talk to the men and women on the ground, because … there are so many of these criminal aliens that keep getting released to go out and commit more crimes that the local law enforcement have to deal with. We can take that violent criminal alien instantly out of the neighborhood,” the ICE director added.

Attorney General Bondi has also threatened to prosecute city officials and withhold federal funds unless Boston cooperates with mass deportations, Wu said at Tuesday’s press conference.

Bondi elaborated on potential consequences for Boston and other identified sanctuary jurisdictions that failed to comply with her directive on a Monday Fox News appearance.

“If they don’t comply with us, we’re going to work with other agencies to cut off their federal funding,” Bondi said. “We are going to send in law enforcement just like we did during the LA riots, just like we’re doing here in Washington, D.C. And if they’re not going to keep their citizens safe, Donald Trump will keep them safe.”

Wu said on a “Java with Jimmy” podcast appearance Wednesday that efforts to cut federal funding to cities that the president dislikes are illegal, as the $300 million in federal funds Boston relies on each year is earmarked through Congress based on census counts that determine how much money is allocated to municipalities.

by Deirdre Schifeling, she/her, Chief Political and Advocacy Officer, ACLU

Earlier this summer, Congress approved its most harmful budget in a generation. H.R. 1 or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” made the biggest cut to Medicaid since it was created in the 1960s and funneled that money to fund President Donald Trump’s racist anti-immigration agenda.

Instead of strengthening Medicaid, Congress took an axe to it. Instead of reining in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abuses, Congress gave the agency billions more to terrorize our communities and detain families.

As Congress returns to their home states to meet with constituents and conduct in-district business during the August recess, the preceding six months must be top of mind. Representatives are facing the judgment of their constituents and must answer for their actions: did they capitulate to the Trump administration, or did they fight back? In turn, the American people must make clear that lawmakers’ attacks on our health care and civil liberties are unacceptable.

Below, we outline what you need to know about this year’s devastating federal budget bill — and how we can fight against this attack.

Cuts to Medicaid Threaten Our Lives

Medicaid is a critical resource across the country, especially for children and people with disabilities. Politicians’ vote to cut Medicaid, a program that provides coverage for an estimated 70 million patients, means that in every single state and congressional district, people are closer to rationing medication, missing essential medical treatments, and losing access to the care they need.

Unsurprisingly, the most vulnerable among us will feel the brunt, including 12 million people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid. Medicaid coverage is a lynchpin to ensure people can exercise their right to live in their own homes, rather than dehumanizing institutions. Denying these supports and care forces people into institutions, stripping them of the liberty and autonomy our Constitution protects.

Martha Haythorn, a 25-year-old woman with Down syndrome from Georgia, is among the people whose freedom is endangered by cuts to Medicaid. She shared with the PBS Newshour that Medicaid helps her access her community. “I deserve to be there,” she said. “Without these benefits, I can’t do that. Is it really worth taking away someone’s benefit, someone’s life, someone’s accommodation?”

Courtney Leader of Missouri told CNN that she wrote to her senator, Josh Hawley, to share how Medicaid has helped her keep caring for her daughter, who has brain damage and cerebral palsy, at home. “Without Medicaid, we would lose everything — our home, our vehicles and, eventually, our daughter,” she wrote. Sen. Hawley was one of the 50 Senators who voted to cut Medicaid.

Medicaid also covers care for the two-thirds of people living in nursing facilities, and for the nearly 14 million people with mental health conditions or substance use disorders. Millions more could lose insurance coverage because of unclear rules and red tape created by new paperwork requirements and related reporting systems for Medicaid coverage.

The impact of H.R. 1 will be felt by people across the country, regardless of their incomes, for decades. Medicaid and other federal funds limited in H.R. 1 keep rural hospitals open, support medical training and clinical research, and ensure that people can get the care they need throughout their lifetimes. Finally, Congress’s cuts reduce the federal share of Medicaid funding, forcing states to cut services to meet budget shortfalls and further compounding the harm to our communities.

Access to health care is essential to our bodily autonomy and our freedom. Without these essential programs, our right to live fulfilled lives and control our futures will be greatly diminished.

Additional Risk to Reproductive Freedom

H.R. 1 also carries out one of the most dangerous goals of Project 2025: “defunding” Planned Parenthood by banning Medicaid patients from using their insurance there. This ban not only means that Medicaid patients can’t use their insurance for birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing, and other preventive care at Planned Parenthood — it also puts access to abortion access at risk even in states where abortion is legal.

A federal court blocked this “defunding” so Medicaid patients can continue to use their insurance for care at Planned Parenthood for now, but the legal battle will surely continue. If Planned Parenthood is truly “defunded,” hundreds of health centers would close, including a quarter of the country’s remaining abortion providers. Patients already struggle to access abortion, and, without Planned Parenthood, that could get even worse.

The ability to access timely reproductive health care will also worsen. There simply are not enough health care providers to serve the millions of patients seen by Planned Parenthood. The Trump administration has already attacked other essential reproductive health providers by withholding funds in the Title X family planning program, leaving patients with even fewer options for care. As a result, patients face longer wait times, travel, and delays in care.

For patients like Jamie Benner-Clemons, “defunding” Planned Parenthood could mean the difference between life and death. Benner-Clemons went to Planned Parenthood when she did not have health insurance. The cancer screening she received caught her breast cancer before it was too late. “The urgency of the health center staff saved my life,” she shared with Planned Parenthood.

Cuts to Medicaid will further endanger pregnant people nationwide. Medicaid covers 40 percent of births in the U.S. Without this coverage during pregnancy, many women would not get essential prenatal care. In rural areas, especially, these cuts will make pregnancy more dangerous. Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people, told The 19th, that “already we’re seeing [pregnancy care] deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”

Cutting Health Care to Fund Detention Camps and Deportations

The politicians who supported H.R. 1 took health care away from millions, while giving $170 billion in taxpayer dollars to an immigration police force larger than most of the world’s militaries and detention camps that could, over time, hold 750,000 children, immigrants with legal status, and other long-time residents from our communities. This sends a clear message that, for politicians, care for people with disabilities is out, while $50,000 bonuses for new ICE agents are in.

This budget will reshape, perhaps permanently, immigration enforcement and detention in the U.S., funneling $45 billion into private prison companies and mass tent cities where few people can find a lawyer. This administration has already cut funding for services for unaccompanied children.

At a time when there are increased deaths in custody and appalling conditions at some of the new immigration camps, ICE is already cashing in on its new allowance and is set to expand detention to almost 110,000 beds in the next six months. This is dangerous and unprecedented. We need members of Congress to bring oversight to these expanding sites.

Meanwhile, in multiplying the number of immigration agents on our streets, H.R. 1 is funding a police state where parents — including U.S. citizens — who take their kids to school or the hospital may be asked to “show their papers” by masked agents or even be detained in private prisons and tent cities without counsel or due process.

We’ve already seen how the Trump administration’s immigration machine is terrorizing our communities. Masked ICE agents across the country have refused to provide identification during arrests, where they have forcibly taken people away in unmarked vehicles and left families with no information on where their loved ones are or whose custody they’ve been taken into. Already, there have been numerous cases of people impersonating ICE officers to threaten and harm people who are immigrants. As these raids and arrests grow more common and more aggressive, it is essential that immigration agents can be identified as such, which is why the VISIBLE Act — a commonsense transparency measure that requires DHS and ICE agents to wear visible identification — was just introduced in the Senate. As ICE agents multiply around the country with this new budget windfall, Congress must pass this bill immediately to protect community safety.

Americans Will Hold Congress Accountable

The politicians who voted for this budget monstrosity chose to sacrifice their constituents’ health, rights, and dignity. The American people will hold them accountable.

This August, the ACLU and our partners hosted events across the country to call out the politicians who supported this reckless attack on our health care, our civil liberties, and our very ability to survive. ACLU People Power volunteers mobilized their communities to town halls and confronted their Congress members about their decisions.

In Colorado, 50 constituents walked into Representative Jeff Hurd’s district lobby, holding signs and leaving hand-written notes at his office.

In Arizona, constituents attended a town hall hosted by the ACLU of Arizona in Representative David Schweikert’s district. Speakers and constituents alike focused on the $170 billion turbocharge of the president’s deportation machine, which has been fraught with abuses of power by the federal government and was paid for through cuts to Medicaid for people with disabilities.

Recent public polling demonstrates how extremely unpopular this bill is with Americans across the country. Two-thirds of the American public (64 percent) opposes H.R. 1. We must make this opposition clear to Congress by showing up at public events, calling, writing, and visiting congressional offices to let politicians know how unhappy constituents are, and how much H.R. 1 hurts our communities, our rights, and our society.

Republican leadership in Congress are preparing to create a multi-billion dollar slush fund for the Trump administration to use as their budget, as well as attach countless policy riders that risk our civil rights and liberties. We have the opportunity to tell our representatives to vote no on any of these poison pill spending bills that restrict our rights and we must. Join People Power today to stay informed about what Congress is up to and how you can get involved to protect all of our rights. Together we will fight and win.

ICE officials told 25 Investigates that 42-year-old mother of three Jemmy Jimenez Rosa was transported from Maine to Burlington, Massachusetts for her release.

She is out and home with her family tonight.

“A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation’s laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused,” a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said. “Lawful Permanent Residents presenting at a U.S. port of entry with previous criminal convictions may be subject to mandatory detention and/or may be asked to provide additional documentation to be set up for an immigration hearing.”

Rosa’s family says she was detained on August 11 at Logan Airport while returning from a family vacation in Mexico with her husband and their three young daughters. She was in custody until Wednesday, August 20.

Husband Marcel Rosa, a U.S. citizen, says he handed over all the passports and his wife’s green card when they landed at Logan. He says his wife came to the United States legally from Peru at the age of nine, and she has held a green card ever since. The US Government renewed her green card again in July. Still, he says an officer pulled Jemmy aside for additional questioning. She was taken into a room alone.

“I walked in, and my wife’s head was just down, and you could tell her whole spirit was just crushed,” he recalled.

Jemmy was held at Logan for four days without access to her medication, a phone call, or even a shower before being transferred to a facility in Maine, according to her family and their attorney.

Rosa says his wife suffers from high blood pressure, is diabetic, and takes medication to treat mental health conditions. She has been hospitalized twice for treatment during her detention at Logan, Rosa says.

25Investigates reporting on those allegations caught the attention of Massachusetts Congressman Stephen Lynch

“This case obviously raised some red flags in terms of the delay and what services are available to her as a legal permanent resident,” Lynch said.

Lynch explained he was told by CBP agents that Jemmy did not request a phone call.

“That’s sort of a weak excuse; they should have informed her of that right,” Lynch said. “There were some medical issues that needed to be addressed. Those were not addressed until she was transferred up to Maine.”

Lynch also explained that he was told Jemmy was brought to Maine because there were no open beds in any similar Massachusetts facilities.

25 Investigates has asked CBP and ICE officials twice regarding the allegations of Jemmy’s detention, but has not heard back.

Rosa says when his wife was detained initially, the officer brought up a decades-old marijuana case. At age 20, Jemmy pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession and served probation.

However, 25 Investigates was there when Jemmy’s criminal record was wiped clean this week.

Her attorney argued in Massachusetts District Court that Jemmy wasn’t given proper counsel when she agreed to the plea 22 years ago. The judge and prosecutor agreed.

With that decision, her attorney filed a motion with the federal court to release Jemmy. He says after that, and one day after 25 Investigates reporting, he was notified that ICE was preparing for her release.

Lynch told Boston 25’s Kerry Kavanaugh that he hopes to visit Logan Airport to see the holding areas.

“Definitely worth looking into, especially where there’s a delay to getting a person access to medical care,” Lynch said.

The family has launched a GoFundMe to help cover legal and unexpected expenses.

The Farm Workforce Modernization Act puts farm workers and their families on a pathway to legalization.","Known as the “Gateway to Cheese Country” and the “Cheese Capital of the USA,” the community of Monroe is a central part of Wisconsin’s dairy history. Besides this fame, the town of 10,000 or so also shares a lot with other small towns in the Midwest. Drive around the city’s courthouse square and you’ll see the offices of local lawyers, some banks and a few bars.

One thing that sets Monroe apart is the area’s relatively recent influx of immigrants.

According to the Applied Population Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Green County, where Monroe is located, has experienced a 229% increase in Latinos from 2000 to 2019. That growth has not been accompanied by a surge in murders, robberies, pet-eatings or any other crimes that the current administration has leveled against migrants. Instead Monroe has seen a rise in the number of Mexican restaurants and bilingual masses at the local Catholic church, as well as hardworking community members hoping to make a better life for themselves.

Which makes the recent events at Monroe’s W&W milk processing plant especially infuriating. Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) acquired W&W earlier this month , and workers describe an ownership philosophy vastly different from the positive work environment and commitment to employees they experienced under the previous owners. Short of formally firing the workers employed there, DFA instituted the E-Verify system as part of their management plan, possibly to avoid the Trump administration’s destructive crackdowns. While this system allows employers to confirm the employment authorization of new hires, employees taking part in the walkout say that in contrast to the previous owners, DFA is requiring verification of all employees, even those who have been there 10-plus years. Not surprisingly, DFA’s decision has triggered a strike and the formation of a legal assistance fund for workers who most likely will lose their jobs after years at the plant.

Across rural America

It’s not an isolated instance; immigrants are being unjustly targeted in similar ways elsewhere in rural America. In Long Prairie, Minnesota, a town much like Monroe, meat processing workers, many of whom received legal status to work with the humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration created for people experiencing potential violence or harm in Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, or Haiti, had their permits revoked by Trump. Hundreds of workers also lost the legal right to work in the United States at a JBS pork production facility in Ottumwa, Iowa, as the current government ended their Temporary Protection Status (TPS). Like humanitarian parole, TPS, which began in 1990, grants people from certain countries work permits who flee disasters like hurricanes or wars.

Throughout the Midwest, milk processing and meat packing firms in rural areas constitute an agro-industrial archipelago where workers, many of whom are immigrants, play a key role in making our food system operate. But instead of being rewarded for years of hard work, immigrants face persecution. Insisting on programs like E-Verify — a voluntary system with documented shortcomings — and removing legal protections terrorize hardworking people. Immigrants and their families deserve better, including legal pathways to remain and work in the country.

In a nutshell, revoking legal protections unfairly turns workers into criminals by making them ineligible to work here. More to the point, these tactics are par for the course when it comes to the current administration’s cruel, underhanded and racist approach to enforcing our country’s outdated immigration system.

This toxic mix of cruelty and racial profiling is on display when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest immigrants at courthouses after their asylum cases are dismissed, making them vulnerable for deportation. The racial profiling is even more blatant when migrants are stopped outside schools or at Home Depot parking lots because of how they look and where they are. Some get thrown to the ground and handcuffed just because they question the reason they are being detained.

An endless vicious cycle

The problem with such tactics — aside from the ethical and legal problems of encouraging government agents to trample on people’s constitutional rights — is efficiency. Immigration hardliners and Trump loyalists like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made it a goal for ICE to fill the for-profit deportation complex with 3,000 arrests per day, having no qualms separating families, arresting children or people who have been model citizens for decades.

ICE has a sordid history of workplace enforcement actions in the past that have proven widely unpopular and non-productive.

We can go back to the Bush administration’s mass raids in places like Worthington, Minnesota, and Postville, Iowa, to show how ICE agents’ large-scale enforcement actions in rural communities tear families apart and leave communities with a long process to heal culturally and economically. What we know over a decade later is that arresting and deporting hundreds of people in such ways does not lead to U.S. citizen workers taking the positions formerly held by immigrants, but the deported people being replaced by, well, another round of immigrants.

But for Trump 2.0, plans for the agro-industrial archipelago are different. Instead of staging mass actions to arrest workers, the government is doing this work digitally. Put otherwise, a faceless bureaucracy revokes programs and permits, giving a contrived legal pretext for ICE to enter communities and arrest people.

Let’s be clear — immigrant workers at these places were trying to “do it the right way.” But this government effectively took the legal carpet from under them as they were trying to scrape a living together for themselves and their families. To threaten these people with deportation is the ultimate in punching down, terrorizing hardworking and community-building people we should be welcoming instead of demonizing.

Real immigration policy reform does not underhandedly manufacture undocumented people, or target people who contribute to the economy, but involves doing the hard work of creating fair, workable policy in Congress. Nor should immigrants be welcomed on a whim of the administration as was the case when white South Africans were given refugee status while suspending protections for thousands of others. Why this special treatment? Most people seeking refugee status are people of color — the South Africans are white.

There are various serious initiatives currently in Congress that could actually improve the lives of immigrants. The bipartisan Dignity Act provides a pathway for citizenship for DREAMers (youth who came to the U.S. without authorization and either attend college or plan to do so) and a work permit system for all other undocumented people. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act puts farm workers and their families on a pathway to legalization. California U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla’s more sweeping Renewing Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 grants lawful permanent resident status — green cards — to people who have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least seven years and do not have a criminal record.

Immigrants come to this country for a variety of reasons, including suffering the effects of flawed trade deals, as well as experiencing war and famine. Many continue to suffer here, working jobs that are ill-paid and dangerous in places like Monroe and Long Prairie. Our current government oppresses them further with draconian and dishonest tactics, scoring cheap political points instead of engaging in actual law enforcement.

Those among us who really care about public security should think long and hard on how this government is entrapping immigrants instead of reforming and enforcing the law.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-19_Monroe-Cheese-workers-Protest_Wisconson-Bailout-the-People-Movement.-Bryan-Pfeifer.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 08:56:52.741959

Walworth County Sheriff Dave Gerber, who was elected in 2022, did not return calls and emails from a Journal Sentinel reporter seeking comment.
None of the four Walworth County judges returned calls or emails seeking comment.
Walworth County has historically been cooperative with ICE efforts, drawing criticism from ACLU of Wisconsin.","A court commissioner in Walworth County says he was forced out of his position after he asked to see an immigration arrest warrant from a sheriff's deputy trying to take a man into custody.

Peter Navis, the county's circuit court commissioner for the past four years, said he resigned after he was told he could voluntarily leave or be fired over the July 15 incident in his courtroom.

The incident is the latest flare-up between judges and the Trump administration as it conducts a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. And it underscores the lack of universal rules on how to deal with immigration arrests in courtrooms.

One of the highest-profile examples is that of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan, who is charged with obstructing federal officers for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant elude arrest.

In the Walworth County case, Navis said he was told by three of the county's judges that Navis had misstated their position about whether immigration warrants had to be shown before an arrest can be made in court.

Judges appoint and can fire commissioners, who exercise similar functions as judges, such as accepting pleas and holding preliminary hearings, in the early stages of a case.

Navis said he was wrong to make a sweeping statement about the judges' stance, but said he stands by his position that deputies should have shown him a warrant before making an arrest.

""There is no avoiding this is a larger issue in the country about how these things are handled ... Every state and county in the country probably has to confront this issue,"" Navis, 45, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview.

""The fact that there were no discussions about how this would happen in Walworth County, and that it was happening in my courtroom for the first time, made it stressful.""

Navis recalled an emotional scene in his courtroom as he objected to the deputies taking the man into custody without showing a warrant. But Navis said he couldn't prevent it.

""They are the deputies,"" he said, ""so it's not like I could physically get down from my bench and stop them from doing it.""

Routine day at Walworth County courthouse turns stressful, chaotic

It was a typical traffic day in Navis' court on July 15. Between 30 and 50 people were crammed in the courtroom.

Then, about 15 minutes before the first case was to be called, a deputy told Navis that someone was going to be arrested on an immigration warrant, Navis recalled.

Deputies often make arrests in traffic court, Navis said, but usually on behalf of other counties. This arrest was for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Navis said he called Walworth County Judge Kristine Drettwan for guidance. Navis said Drettwan told him how she would handle the matter. He declined to share what Drettwan said.

She then told him he had authority to conduct matters in his courtroom ""as he saw fit,"" Navis recalled.

Drettwan did not return calls and emails seeking comment.

Navis said he asked the deputies about the arrest plan and to see the warrant. Deputies refused on both counts, he said.

""In other situations, the warrants were issued by courts in Wisconsin and they are readily available,"" Navis said. ""The type of warrant and authority claimed was different and that’s why I asking for it, to see if there was lawful authority.""

In a transcript of the hearing obtained by the Journal Sentinel, Navis said the sheriff's office was failing to follow a court order that deputies show a warrant.

""The failure to inform the Court of this impending action calls into question whether this Court can trust the Sheriff’s Office in the future,"" Navis said.

The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Andrew Herrmann, said Navis had no right to see the warrant.

Navis countered that the defendant, named in the transcript as Enrrique Onan Zamora Castro, was out on a signature bond but was now being detained without evidence of a warrant.

According to online court records, Castro, 33, of Milwaukee, was facing charges of operating without a valid license for the second time in three years. Wisconsin court records show he was previously convicted of felony stalking and disorderly conduct in Milwaukee County, in 2023 and 2025. He received probation in both cases.

Navis then added that he had been instructed by the county's judges to prevent an arrest without a warrant.

A short time later, ICE officers appeared with deputies to make a second arrest, according to the transcript.

At that point, Navis says, ""I’ve been instructed by the judges of this county to require warrants before individuals are detained in my courtroom.""

Judges, sheriff's office decline to comment

Walworth County Clerk of Courts Michele Jacobs, who learned of the incident soon after, said deputies routinely arrest people on warrants in the courthouse.

""Deputies were executing a warrant, something they have done for years in the courtroom ... The commissioner was asking questions about it and it became an incident,"" Jacobs said. ""It did not go the way it usually goes.""

Walworth County Sheriff Dave Gerber, who was elected in 2022, did not return calls and emails from a Journal Sentinel reporter seeking comment. A spokeswoman said the sheriff had no comment.

ICE officials did not respond to questions about the case.

The incident soon came to the attention of Walworth County's four judges: Drettwan, Daniel Johnson, Estee E. Scholtz and presiding judge, David Reddy. Scholtz beat Navis for an open judge's seat in April 2024.

Navis said Scholtz, Johnson and Drettwan met with him late in the day on July 21; Reddy was not present.

According to Navis, the judges said he misstated their position. However, Navis said they didn't ask him to explain and gave him an ultimatum: resign or be fired.

Jacobs, the clerk of courts, confirmed she too was at the meeting, but declined to comment because it is a personnel matter.

None of the four Walworth County judges returned calls or emails seeking comment.

Navis, who according to Jacobs made $138,195, formerly worked as a corporation counsel and a private judge.

The county is accepting applications for a new court commissioner and hope to have a new person hired in early fall, she said.

After Navis said he would resign, he was allowed to gather his personal belongings in the presence of a county employee and then was escorted out of the building.

""It was a very normal course of what we would do if someone resigned or terminated. They no longer have free reign of the building,"" she said.

Walworth County has historically cooperated with ICE, according to ACLU

Walworth County, home to about 100,000 people and located in south-central Wisconsin on the Illinois border, has been in the news before because of immigration.

As a wave of Nicaraguan immigrants arrived in the college town of Whitewater, critics including Donald Trump — who was not president at the time — blamed crime and other issues on the new arrivals. City officials disputed that.

Walworth County has historically been cooperative with ICE efforts, drawing criticism from ACLU of Wisconsin.

As Trump's immigration crackdown has continued, other Wisconsin counties have also found themselves caught between federal enforcement priorities and local authority.

In Milwaukee, ICE and other federal agents made several arrests in the Milwaukee County courthouse, raising questions about their authority in local courthouses.

In some cases, local prosecutors have clashed with federal immigration officials over attempts to deport crime defendants or witnesses before their cases conclude.

In Dane County, a woman who ICE says is in the U.S. illegally and is charged with drunk driving resulting in the death of two teens. State prosecutors are seeking to have the defendant returned to state custody to ensure ICE does not deport her before she can face charges.

In Milwaukee County, a man is charged with trying to get a victim in his case deported before he could testify against him.

In the case of Dugan, her legal team is arguing she was acting in her legal capacity as a judge. Both sides are awaiting how U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman will rule on the defense's motion to dismiss the charges.

Amnesty International has reviewed documentation which shows that AI tools Babel X and Palantir’s Immigration OS have automated capabilities that enable constant mass monitoring and surveillance, often for the purpose of targeting non-US citizens.

The human rights organisation added that its research shows how these tools are being used by the US government to track migrants and that the tools also “carry a high risk of being used as part of the ‘Catch and Revoke’ initiative”.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio launched the AI-powered “Catch and Revoke” to cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups.

The AI-driven ‘Catch and Revoke’ initiative combines social media monitoring, visa status tracking, and automated threat assessments of foreign individuals on visas, including international students.

However, critics warn that Pro-Palestinian sentiments have often been conflated with antisemitism or pro-terrorism, leaving people vulnerable to being caught in an AI-enabled social media net.

Erika Guevara-Rosas, Senior Director for Research at Amnesty International, said the “coercive ‘Catch and Revoke’ initiative risks supercharging arbitrary and unlawful visa revocations, detentions, deportations and violations of a slew of human rights”.

She also said it is “deeply concerning that the US government is deploying invasive AI-powered technologies within a context of a mass deportation agenda and crackdown on pro-Palestine expression”.

Babel X

Babel X is provided by Babel Street, which has partnered with 84% of US national security agencies.

Babel X can gather sweeping amounts of data from a single identifier, such as a person’s name, email, or phone number.

Amnesty said that information gathered by Babel X can be used by US authorities to make a decision about revoking an individual’s visa.

However, it warns that “probabilistic technologies used to draw inferences about individuals’ intent have massive margins for error, can often be discriminatory and biased, and could lead to falsely framing pro-Palestine content as antisemitic”.

Amnesty said that Babel X has been “tasked specifically with monitoring refugees and asylum seekers” and warns that it “risks rendering individuals suspicious by default, and subjecting them to the risk of visa revocation, detention and deportation”.

Immigration OS by Palantir

In April 2025, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $30 million contract to track “self-deportations” and identify priority deportation cases, particularly visa overstays.

The Immigration OS system serves as an upgrade to a previous Palantir system which had been used by ICE since 2014.

Amnesty claimed that the Immigration OS “automates an already deeply flawed and unaccountable process that has a history of disregarding due process and human rights”.

During the first Trump administration, in 2020, Amnesty International wrote to Palantir about its human rights due diligence processes.

In response, Palantir said it “shares your organization’s concern with the potential serious human rights violations against migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers at the US–Mexico border”.

‘Due diligence’

In July, Amnesty contacted Palantir Technologies and Babel Street for comment.

Babel Street did not respond, but Palantir Technologies said its product was not used to power the “Catch and Revoke” effort.

However, Palantir said its Immigration OS “does include work that directly serves” ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Amnesty said the “Trump administration’s public intention to engage in mass deportations” meant the companies “could have reasonably foreseen the risk of harm being seen across the country and reconsidered entering into these contracts”.

“Had Palantir and Babel Street adequately carried out human rights due diligence, these companies could and should have similarly declined to engage in these mass deportation efforts,” said Guevara-Rosas.

She called on Palantir and Babel Street to “conduct and publish the full findings of human rights due diligence processes” .

“Unless Palantir and Babel Street can demonstrate they can use their leverage as suppliers to improve the serious human rights consequences borne by the policies of their clients,” said Guevara-Rosas, “these companies should immediately cease their work with the US administration related to immigration enforcement.”",https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6795130/river/?height=400&version=6795199,N,,2025-08-21 06:56:44.972864

“Every year, you make us tell you how we help thousands of day laborers get jobs across the city.
The immigration raids in the valley have even extended to students and schools.","While residents celebrated 818 Day across the San Fernando Valley, a coalition of pro-immigrant organizations took to the streets outside Van Nuys City Hall to demand an end to federal immigration raids in the 818.

The “All Eyes on the Valley” rally on Aug. 18 brought attention to the predominantly Latino communities in the valley that have been terrorized by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

“There’s nowhere else I’d rather be on 818 Day than in these streets,” said Carla Orendorff, organizer with Aetna Street Solidarity and the San Fernando Valley Homeless Union. “Because we have so much to fight for, we have so much to live for and our resistance is life.”

Since the President Donald Trump administration chose to target Los Angeles in early June, the valley has seen increasing instances of unidentified masked men with no federal warrant arresting people off the street.

In fact, between June 6 and July 20, Panorama City was the most targeted area where the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) LA Rapid Response Network received calls from.

Many of those being detained are street vendors and day laborers, as federal immigration authorities target areas where they work, notably outside home improvement stores. Dozens have been detained in immigration raids outside the Home Depots in the City of San Fernando, North Hollywood and Van Nuys.

Megan Ortiz is the executive director of the Instituto de Educación Popular del Sur de California (IDEPSCA), a nonprofit organization that operates five of the seven day laborer centers in LA. Three of those centers are co-located with Home Depots.

“Across those day labor centers, they have been raided 12 times,” said Ortiz. “Six of the 12 raids at the Home Depot co-located day labor centers have happened at the Van Nuys Home Depot.”

These detainments can often be violent and dangerous. In Pacoima, a tamales vendor suffered a heart attack when Border Patrol agents grabbed her from behind; in San Fernando, a day laborer broke his leg when fleeing from ICE agents; and in Van Nuys, CBP agents broke windows and dragged laborers out of their vehicles.

Last week in Monrovia, Roberto Carlos Montoya died while fleeing ICE agents. The day laborer was handcuffed when he was hit by a car.

“Two federal judges have said that this is illegal,” said Cal Soto, workers’ rights director at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). “Today they continue to illegally arrest people on the corner based on the color of their skin, the language they’re speaking and the type of work they’re seeking. Shame!”

Raids are still taking place despite a temporary restraining order (TRO) being issued by a federal district judge and upheld by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“I’m a lawyer. We’re fighting this case in the courts,” said Soto. “But I can tell you one thing, the lawyers and the judges are not going to enforce our human rights. It’s the people on the streets who are going to enforce it.”

Ortiz questioned why the city hasn’t done more to protect the day laborer centers, when these are spaces funded by the city.

“I would like to know from the office of the city attorney if I can obtain a protective order against my day labor centers,” said Ortiz.

“Every year, you make us tell you how we help thousands of day laborers get jobs across the city. You make us fill out a thousand reports telling y’all [about] all the money that day laborers are bringing to the city economy,” she continued. “Yet you are allowing, day by day, for these workers to be disappeared and stolen from our neighborhoods, from their families.”

Immigration authorities have also targeted those documenting and witnessing the raids.

At a raid outside the Lowes in Pacoima, one U.S. citizen was violently pulled out of his vehicle and detained by federal agents while documenting, spending hours in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody before being released. Days later, he still had marks on his wrists from the handcuffs.

At the Van Nuys Home Depot, one of the day laborers center’s staff members and three volunteers documenting the raid were arrested by federal authorities and held for 50 hours in the Metropolitan Detention Center before being released.

The immigration raids in the valley have even extended to students and schools.

Last week, outside Arleta High School, nearly a dozen masked Border Patrol agents detained, handcuffed and later released a 15-year-old San Fernando High School Student with mental disabilities who was waiting in a vehicle with his grandmother.

A CBP spokesperson claimed they were not targeting the school, but were conducting an operation aimed at a “criminal illegal alien,” whom they mistook the child for.

In Van Nuys, an 18-year-old rising senior at Reseda Charter High School was detained while walking his dog. He is still being held in custody while awaiting deportation.

“He is like many students who come here with a dream to do better. He should be starting his senior high school year right now, and instead, he is in detention, where he is afraid,” said Lizette Becerra, LA Unified School District (LAUSD) educator and former teacher of the teen.

“This is not what students need to be worrying about. All students, all children, regardless of their immigration status, have the right to a free and fair education,” she continued. “We as teachers have the moral and legal obligation to protect our students. We would take bullets for our students. We will protect them from ICE.”

Demonstrators called for the release of illegally detained workers and an end to family separations; for Mayor Karen Bass to take action to protect immigrant Angelenos; protection of day laborers; a stop to the targeting of immigrant rights organizations; a ban on ICE at schools; and a cancellation of rent and mortgage payments for those affected by the raids.

“We will organize, and we will defend, and we will fight back,” said Orendorff. “We will not accept any more kidnappings or abductions. No more killing of our people.”",https://i0.wp.com/sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250818_All-Eyes-on-the-Valley_SN_12-scaled-e1755744606165.jpeg?fit=1900%2C1267&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-21 05:56:36.253634

The ""informational item"" – championed by Commissioner Jeremy Matlow, who recently announced his mayor campaign – would look into current litigation in South Miami that questions whether Florida cities and towns are required to enter immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. City staff would also consider the ramifications of Tallahassee piggybacking onto the lawsuit.

But there was deep concern from Commissioners Dianne Williams-Cox and Curtis Richardson over potential retaliation from Governor Ron DeSantis, who has ousted public officials who he says are thwarting Florida law.

Around 30 people filled the city commission chamber at City Hall to speak out against the controversial immigration agreement.

The agreement, according to the ICE website, allows ""ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations to partner with state and local law enforcement to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S..""

Several speakers denounced the agreement and said they could no longer trust in local law enforcement. Others spoke on rising fears in the community following an immigration raid in Collegetown in May. Still others expressed disgust with the city for not putting the topic on the Aug. 20 agenda for a public discussion.

""We've seen U.S. citizens being stopped by law enforcement and unlawfully detained on the basis of their perceived ethnicity,"" said Alejandro Garcia. ""We've seen the opening of a massive detention camp in the Everglades and now a second facility being planned in Baker, all at enourmous cost to the taxpayer and with no other aim, it seems, except to deny these people being held their with adequate access to legal counsel.""

The group of speakers said that the decision at the meeting was ""a win"" and a step in the right direction.

Commission expresses concern over state level retaliation

To kick off the conversation sparked by public speakers, Mayor John Dailey expressed his stance on the matter: ""I will tell you I stand firmly, firmly against violations of basic human rights whether they're Tallahassee citizens, citizens of the state of Florida, the United States. I too look at what's going on across the country and I am very deeply disturbed of the videos that I'm seeing in other communities.""

Dailey asked TPD Chief Lawrence Revell to come to the podium to explain what it is local law enforcement does in the terms of the agreement, but comments from the audience such as ""shame"" and loud boos caused the mayor to shut down the discussion as he passed the gavel to Williams-Cox to address other topics.

After a short break, the board reconvened for public hearings and Dailey continued the paused conversation.

According to Revell, one officer has completed the training on immigration policies but has hit some hiccups in the credentialing process.

""(Staff) ran into some problems on the federal side, not our side. So as I understand, he is not credentialed... but we have complied with the training,"" Revell said. He continued saying there is no set amount of officers needed to partake in the training but of the 396 within TPD, they selected only one officer.

Richardson expressed concern about the governor and attorney general's threats toward commissioners and elected officials who sought to thwart the agreement.

""There was some (speakers) who indicated that we should state a position or take a position and if don't do that we would be afraid of being removed from office,"" Richardson said.

""I'm not going to speak for anyone else other than Curtis Richardson. It would not be in my best interest to put myself in a position to potentially be removed from office. The residents, the voters of this community that elected me to office, elected me to address all the issues facing our community,"" he continued. ""If put in that position, having to defend myself and pay those legal costs ... I am not willing to do that.""

Williams-Cox added that the community would not be served if sitting commissioners were ousted by the governor and replaced by ""folks who he knows will do what it is he wants to have done.""

""It's not that I'm scared, what it is is that you've got to be the adult in the room and understand that there are other things that we are responsible for ... other people are counting on us as well,""

Matlow took a more aggressive stance on the issue in comparison: ""I want to say we are not legally required to enter the 287(g) agreement. It's not in the legislation and it hasn't been affirmed by the court of law. I understand the governor and the attorney general have issued threats and made an opinion, but we're not a nation of kings, presidents nor governors are not kings.""

""In a moment in time when all across our community people our terrified, to not at least stand up and say let's ask a judge to affirm what Ron DeSantis is saying is accurate isn't the leadership we need to see in a city like Tallahassee.""

Resolution to take another stand on 'dehumanizing' immigration policy fails

Following the unanimous vote, Commissioner Jack Porter, who was attending online, urged her colleagues to pass a resolution similar to one passed by Miami Beach condemning the ""dehumanizing and violent rhetoric and targeting"" of immigrants.

""It's for the residents of Tallahassee to know where we stand on the issue,"" Porter said.

Dailey said he would need to study the Miami Beach resolution, adding that the commission had already made it clear during the meeting where it stood on the policies of the Trump administration.

The vote ended in a familiar 3-2 split, with Dailey, Williams-Cox and Richardson against creating a resolution.","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PTAL/83927568007-raid-at-const-site.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-21 09:57:13.635883

Since being sworn in for a second term in January, Trump has targeted top US universities over claims they are politically biased towards ""woke"" politics and has charged – without evidence – that they have engaged in antisemitic policies.

The administration has characterised widespread campus protests and sit-ins in the United States calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza as being ""antisemitic"", and moved to expel foreign students and professors who took part in them.

Trump has made the question of student protest, particularly by foreign scholars, a flashpoint political issue.

* The underlying policy is obviously what matters, but the juvenile names aren’t helping: “Nebraska announced plans Tuesday for an immigration detention center in the remote southwest corner of the state as President Donald Trump’s administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations. The facility will be dubbed the ‘Cornhusker Clink,’ a play on Nebraska’s nickname of the Cornhusker State and an old slang term for jail.”

* The first, but not the last: “A senior White House official is decamping for K Street — the first instance this year of a prominent aide to President Donald Trump leaving for a lobbying gig. Trent Morse has been serving since January as deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of the Office of Personnel, which vets candidates for thousands of roles across the federal government.”

Two existing governors, Christopher J. Waller and Michelle W. Bowman, were appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term.","In addition to emails, text messages and voice mail records, the subpoena also requested any messages sent or received through the encrypted WhatsApp messaging service, as well as “similar applications.”

The records request revealed the extent to which the administration has sought to pierce powerful federal confidentiality protections for patients and their medical providers as part of the government’s pressure campaign to end all transition care for children.

Officials briefed on the investigation have previously described subpoenas to hospitals and doctors on transgender care as part of an effort to determine whether any laws have been broken, and to provide leverage for negotiations with health care providers who provide transgender care. Investigators could eventually seek criminal charges if evidence of fraud is uncovered, officials said.

The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s gender and sexuality development clinic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department investigations of pediatricians and children’s hospitals are just one component of the Trump administration’s campaign against pediatric gender care.

In May, nine leading children’s hospitals across the country received letters from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, demanding data on children’s gender-related treatments. Those letters applied explicit financial pressure to the hospitals, saying that “hospitals accepting federal funds are expected to meet rigorous quality standards.”

In June, the F.B.I. put out a call to the public to report hospitals and doctors who were performing gender-related surgeries on minors. Last month, a top Justice Department official announced at an event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission that manufacturers of drugs used in transgender care were under investigation for possible violations of drug marketing laws.

Even in blue states with laws that broadly allow such care, hospitals and clinics have sharply curtailed gender-related treatments for transgender youth amid the threats from the federal government. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, for example, shuttered its renowned clinic for transgender care last month.

Inside the Shake Shack, Mr. Miller declared that the jeering would directly result in the administration’s throwing more resources at lowering crime rates that Mr. Trump has called “totally out of control” but that have actually fallen sharply the past two years.

“I’m glad they’re here today,” Mr. Miller said of the hecklers, “because me, Pete and the vice president are all going to leave here and, inspired by them, we’re going to add thousands more resources to this city to get the criminals and the gang members out of here.”

The White House and Mr. Miller did not immediately respond to requests for comment on who would be joining the crackdown effort.

The shouting and booing provided a melodramatic foil for Mr. Miller and the other officials to cast themselves as fighting against a lawless city ruined by liberal maniacs. “All these demonstrators that you’ve seen out here in recent days, all these elderly white hippies, they’re not part of the city and never have been,” Mr. Miller said.

He cast the administration’s actions as being in the interests of the city’s Black residents, arguing that the crackdown would help people who are most affected by crime in the city. “This is not a city that has had any safety for its Black citizens for generations, and President Trump is the one who is fixing that,” he said. But so far, most of the troops have been seen near monuments and tourist zones — places like Union Station.

The train hall had fallen onto hard times during the pandemic with a rise in crime (it was seen as grim bellwether in Washington when the Starbucks in Union Station closed up shop) and has not rebounded as well as some of the other busier parts of the city.

In that way, it made for a handy backdrop for the officials’ impromptu news conference. They certainly seemed to make the most out of their clash with the yammering protesters in the station. “We’re going to ignore these stupid white hippies that all need to go home and take a nap because they’re all over 90 years old,” Mr. Miller said at one point as the defense secretary and vice president smirked.

Mr. Vance, for his turn, had this to say about the people who were booing him: “We’ve traded, now, some violent crazy people who are screaming at kids, with a few crazy liberals who are screaming at the vice president. But I think that’s a very worthwhile trade to make because we want our people to be able to enjoy our beautiful cities.”

He was asked whether the White House planned to extend the federalization of Washington’s police department beyond 30 days. Like other members of the administration who have been asked this question, he was noncommittal. “If the president of the United States thinks that he has to extend this order to ensure that people have access to public safety, that’s exactly what he’ll do,” Mr. Vance said.

A reporter pointed out to him that polls showed that most people in Washington were strongly opposed to the administration’s actions in the city.

“I don’t know what poll you’re talking about,” Mr. Vance said. “Maybe the same polls that said Kamala Harris would win the popular vote by 10 points.”

And then he said: “OK, we’re going to stop there. We’re going to grab a quick bite with some of the soldiers here in the National Guard.”

The Foreign Malign Influence Center, created by Congress in 2022, coordinates efforts across intelligence agencies to monitor threats to elections and public debate. During the last election, intelligence officials held regular briefings to warn of attempts by Russia and other countries to manipulate the vote in the United States.

The center also issued warnings about deepfake videos that spread false information about Vice President Kamala Harris, and about videos from Russia that sought to spread false claims about damaged ballots and illegal voting.

But Republicans have criticized the Biden administration’s election-defense efforts, saying that its attempts to counter foreign disinformation curtailed the free speech rights of conservatives. Early in the second Trump administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency shut down its election-defense efforts, while Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the F.B.I. to dismantle its malign influence task force.

Even though the Foreign Malign Influence Center was created long after the 2016 presidential election, Ms. Gabbard has been deeply critical in recent weeks of its examination that year of Russian election interference. She has said the 2016 assessment was flawed, and has accused Obama administration officials of a “treasonous conspiracy,” comments that have earned Mr. Trump’s praise.

Because the center was created by Congress, it is difficult for Ms. Gabbard to eliminate it outright. Instead, the memo said she would fold its operations into another part of her office, called Mission Integration, that oversees national intelligence officers.

The reorganization plan also shrinks two other centers and folds them into the Mission Integration office. One of the centers is dedicated to cybersecurity, and the other focuses on chemical, biological and nuclear threats.

In a social media post Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Gabbard said her reorganization plan was a first step toward making her office more efficient and agile, saving taxpayers $700 million a year and “rooting out deep state actors.”

The memo said that the National Intelligence University, which is akin to a military war college that trains midcareer intelligence professionals, would enroll its final students in the fall. Over the course of the school year, it would move its academic programs to the National Defense University and other government schools. The National Intelligence University, based in Bethesda, Md., will close no later than June 1, 2026, the memo said.

The proposal immediately generated criticism on Capitol Hill among Democrats, many of whom were concerned about Ms. Gabbard’s decision on Tuesday to revoke the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, including two Senate staff members. Many of those affected had worked on Russia analysis or foreign threats to U.S. elections.

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was in need of “thoughtful reform,” and that he and his colleagues would review her plan.

“But given Director Gabbard’s track record of politicizing intelligence — including her decision just yesterday to revoke security clearances from career national security officials — I have no confidence that she is the right person to carry out this weighty responsibility,” Mr. Warner said.

Ms. Gabbard’s office said that so far, she had decreased the number of employees at the office from 1,800 to 1,300, a figure reported earlier by Newsmax. According to the memo to Congress, Ms. Gabbard’s office was extending voluntary early retirement until March 31, 2026, to further shrink the work force.

“It is my commitment to you, and my charge to the O.D.N.I. leadership team, that we will continue to drive efficiencies across the organization,” Ms. Gabbard wrote in the memo.

According to Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Ms. Cook obtained a $203,000 loan on a property in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 2021 and declared her intent to make it her primary residence. Two weeks later, according to a letter he posted on social media, she purchased an Atlanta condominium with a $540,000 mortgage and said that it would be her primary residence. The following year, the letter added, she listed the Atlanta condo for rent.

Mortgage lenders want to know if you intend to use a property as your primary residence. Generally, the best interest rates and loan terms (say, a 30-year mortgage instead of a shorter one) go to those people. If it is your one and only home, you are likely to do everything you can to make the payment each month.

Lenders will often charge a higher interest rate for a second home or a property you intend to use as a rental since the risks there are higher. If you run into financial trouble, after all, you will be more likely to stop making payments on the rental property than on the home where you live.

To Mr. Pulte, it “appears” that Ms. Cook has “falsified bank documents and property records” to get a better deal. A spokeswoman for the Fed did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Ms. Cook.

According to Rocket Mortgage, one of the biggest lenders in the United States, you can’t have two primary residences. People’s life circumstances can change quickly though, and it is fine to rent out your old home after purchasing a new one if the mortgage allows that. You are just supposed to make lenders aware of your plans and changing circumstances.

It is not unusual for people in the public eye to find themselves the subject of real estate scrutiny. This year, documents emerged showing that Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, declared three separate properties to be his and his wife’s primary residences. The Trump administration has lobbed similar accusations at Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, and Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California.

Prosecutions of such matters tend to be rare, but they are not unprecedented. Last year, Baltimore City’s former state’s attorney was found guilty of making a false mortgage application. In that case, the conviction hinged on the origin of the down payment funds.

Judge Berman said that although Trump’s Justice Department had argued that there was precedent for unsealing grand jury testimony, there were no “special circumstances” that would justify it — and that the transcript “pales in comparison to the investigation information and materials in the hands of the Department of Justice.”

The department has already undertaken a “comprehensive investigation” and “assembled a ‘trove’” of documents, interviews and exhibits, the judge wrote.

“The government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein files,” Judge Berman wrote. Its request to unseal the meager transcript “appears to be a ‘diversion’ from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the government’s possession.”

The federal government has 100,000 pages of files and materials that “dwarf the 70-odd pages of Epstein grand jury materials,” the judge said. Indeed, the Justice Department is to begin providing some files about the Epstein case to lawmakers on Friday, the chairman of the House of Representatives’ main investigative committee said this week.

In the six years since Mr. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial, his death has inspired myriad conspiracy theories.

His proximity to powerful people inspired conspiracy theorists who have promoted the idea that America is controlled by a cabal of politicians and the wealthy. His death in federal custody, which was ruled a suicide, has also spurred improbable notions about an assassination.

Top aides to Mr. Trump championed some of those theories before they entered government, and Mr. Trump had promised to release information about the investigation. However, the administration’s failure to disclose any revelations has threatened to drive a wedge between the president and some of his most fervent supporters.

The Justice Department announced last month that it had closed an “exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein.” The review “revealed no incriminating ‘client list’” or evidence that “Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals,” the department and the F.B.I. said in an unsigned memo. The government indicated that there would be no more disclosures about Mr. Epstein.

The announcement set off a furious backlash.

The issue effectively brought the House to halt last month, but Republican leaders expressed hope that the Trump administration’s requests to release grand jury testimony might mollify hard-right lawmakers and their constituents, who believe the material will implicate Democrats.

But before lawmakers left for their August recess, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for its files on the Epstein case. The department said it would begin providing files to the committee by Friday — but the grand jury materials will remain secret.

Grand jury evidence, tailored by prosecutors to make their case, is presented in proceedings that almost always remain secret.

The Trump Justice Department’s request that Judge Berman unseal the transcripts was among several made to federal courts in New York and Florida in recent weeks, part of an effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to stem criticism that the government was hiding information.

Judge Berman’s opinion came about a week after a different Manhattan judge denied the government’s request to unseal transcripts from its investigation into Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime companion of Mr. Epstein. Ms. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sexually exploiting and abusing teenage girls in concert with Mr. Epstein.

In July, a federal judge in Florida denied a request by the Justice Department to release transcripts from two federal grand juries there that investigated Mr. Epstein in 2005 and 2007.

Confidentiality was a central concern for the judges considering the Justice Department’s requests.

The judge overseeing Ms. Maxwell’s case, Paul A. Engelmayer, said that unsealing grand jury materials “casually or promiscuously” would erode confidence in people called to testify before future panels.

In his opinion, Judge Engelmayer said the Justice Department’s argument that the grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information was “demonstrably false.”

Doing so, in fact, “would expose as disingenuous the government’s public explanations for moving to unseal,” he wrote.

Echoing his colleague, Judge Berman said that the grand jury testimony in Mr. Epstein’s case was “merely a hearsay snippet.”

Michael Gold contributed reporting from Washington.

“In the past, the agency and department secretaries have always, or almost always, followed that guidance,” Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who leads the committee, said in an interview. “But in this administration, it is clear that we need to move far more of that language on how the money should be spent into the bills themselves.”

The changes may not survive negotiations with the House, where Republicans have been far more deferential to Mr. Trump. And they may not have a chance to be enacted, given the White House’s determination to have its way on spending. But proponents say that at the very least, the safeguards could strengthen the position of Congress in future legal battles over funding.

The guardrails are largely technical and include putting instructions into legislative text that would have previously been spelled out in nonbinding reports.

For example, officials say that detailed tables on spending for major agencies such as the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services are now being added to the text of the bills themselves, to try to assure that the funds are used for their specified purposes. The guardrails also include significant new requirements for reporting to Congress on terminating contracts and grant awards, as well as for making substantial reductions in the federal work force.

The changes come as the White House Office of Management and Budget and its director, Russell T. Vought, have sought to assert extraordinary executive branch control over spending, arguing that the levels set by Congress are a ceiling, not a floor. Mr. Vought has said that congressional negotiations need to be less bipartisan, and has called the decades-old budget law empowering Congress on spending unconstitutional.

That claim is disputed on Capitol Hill, where the congressional power of the purse is considered paramount.

“I believe members of Congress who know their districts and states should decide how taxpayer dollars get spent — not faceless political appointees, and not any president who wrongly believes they hold the power of the purse instead of Congress,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. She said she would continue to press for more restraints on the administration.

In March, Ms. Murray joined Ms. Collins in a letter to Mr. Vought protesting his unilateral decision to not spend nearly $3 billion in emergency funds out of a $12 billion allocation by Congress, arguing that he was overstepping his power.

Along with Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, they also challenged the budget office’s decision to take down a legally required website tracking the administration’s disbursement of money. An appeals court recently upheld a ruling ordering the White House to put it back online.

The website has since been restored, though Democrats say that not all the required information is available. Ms. Murray said the website shows that the White House has tried “to secretly and illegally exert even more control over funding approved by Congress.”

Even with the stronger language being added in the Senate, lawmakers cannot be certain that the White House will follow their directives. But Ms. Collins noted that the new safeguards would bolster Congress in any legal fight with the White House over intent with funding. “Then there is much stronger grounds if there is a lawsuit,” she said.

As August winds down, Congress is about to enter a critical phase of its spending debate ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline. For the first time in years, the Senate earlier this month considered individual spending bills on the floor, and approved three relatively noncontentious measures on military construction, agriculture programs and congressional funding.

When Congress returns after Labor Day, lawmakers would like to make more progress, though approving and sending the 12 annual spending bills to Mr. Trump is not a realistic possibility. That means Congress will either have to agree to extend funding at its current levels, or the government will shut down.

Other factors could intercede to complicate the fight. Senate Republicans have said that they intend to try to change rules governing confirmations in order to clear a backlog of nominees, a decision likely to embroil the chamber in a partisan fight. And the White House is threatening to cancel more congressionally approved funding by the end of the fiscal year, which could upend critical spending talks.

Ms. Collins said the White House should refrain from doing so, and leave the cutting to Congress.

“We understand that spending needs to change over time, but you don’t exclude the appropriations process,” she said.

She and other lawmakers say they believe their best case for protecting the spending power of Congress is to pass the annual spending bills with specific instructions, and have Mr. Trump sign them into law. Operating under what is known as a continuing resolution, as the government is now, provides the White House with more discretion to determine spending levels. Members of Congress say they want to limit that flexibility.

“If Congress thinks we should be more specific — and I happen to think we should be more specific with our appropriations directions — then we have to pass appropriations bills, not a continuing resolution, for the coming year,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota and a member of the Appropriations Committee.

If those bills pass and are signed into law, Ms. Collins said, “it is the way the system is supposed to work.”

The scientist, Vinh Nguyen, was one of 37 current and former national security officials whose security clearances were revoked on Tuesday. Many, though not all, had tangential connections to the intelligence agencies’ review of Russian efforts to influence and meddle in the 2016 election.

Ms. Gabbard has released documents about that intelligence inquiry and accused Obama administration officials of related crimes, an effort Mr. Trump has praised.

Lt. Gen. William J. Hartman, the acting N.S.A. director, called Ms. Gabbard in the days before the revocation and asked to see the evidence that Mr. Nguyen, the agency’s chief data scientist, had done anything that merited the revocation of his security clearance.

Ms. Gabbard rebuffed the request, the officials said. The list of people losing their clearance began to circulate Tuesday morning and was made public in the afternoon.

The N.S.A. referred all questions to Ms. Gabbard’s office, which did not return a request for comment.

Former officials have criticized the revocation of the 37 security clearances and the wider purge of national security officials. In an article in The Atlantic published on Wednesday, William J. Burns, the former C.I.A. director and a longtime diplomat, said the removal of public servants was part of a campaign of retribution.

“It is about breaking people and breaking institutions by sowing fear and mistrust throughout our government,” Mr. Burns wrote. “It is about paralyzing public servants — making them apprehensive about what they say, how it might be interpreted, and who might report on them. It is about deterring anyone from daring to speak truth to power.”

Mr. Nguyen, the son of a South Vietnamese general who fought alongside American forces in the Vietnam War, was recruited as a 17-year-old high school student to join the National Security Agency because of his math skills.

He rose through the ranks of the agency to become its chief data scientist. Friends and former colleagues of Mr. Nguyen said he had been in charge of developing artificial intelligence systems to improve the gathering of foreign communications. He has also been involved in the intelligence community’s work on quantum computing, which has the potential to break current encryption systems and revolutionize espionage.

In the days before Mr. Nguyen was dismissed, N.S.A. officials were concerned that his job was at risk, as conservative publications began to look at his work as the national intelligence officer in charge of cyber in 2016.

Reports in conservative publications had led to the ouster of the N.S.A.’s top lawyer, April Falcon Doss, in July. And the previous director of the agency, Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, was fired in the spring after Laura Loomer, the far-right conspiracy theorist, accused him of having ties to Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Former officials had expected General Hartman, who replaced General Haugh, to be nominated for the job permanently. But neither the Pentagon nor the White House has formally made that move.

There is no evidence Mr. Nguyen mishandled classified data, made poor analytic judgments or politicized his work. However, his role in the analysis of Russian election meddling in 2016 has been a focus of conservative news media, which under Ms. Gabbard has been enough to cost N.S.A. officials their jobs.

Mr. Nguyen’s job became endangered after Ms. Gabbard released a series of statements from an intelligence analyst about Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The analyst had questioned whether Russian attempts to hack computer networks linked to voting systems were given too little attention in the Intelligence Community Assessment being prepared after that election, according to officials.

“After being directed to conduct analysis of Russian-attributed cyberactivity for the I.C.A., I had been abruptly directed to abandon further investigation,” the analyst wrote, referring to the Intelligence Community Assessment.

The analyst worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency but had been assigned to work on the cyber team in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

In an article published on Aug. 8, Real Clear Investigations identified Mr. Nguyen as the analyst’s supervisor. The report suggested that Mr. Nguyen was likely to be the supervisor who had told the analyst that other Russian influence activities — not the hacking of voting systems — were a critical part of its campaign to meddle in the 2016 election.

Ms. Gabbard has charged that after the election, intelligence officials changed their view of Russian efforts to interfere. But in reality, officials did not change their views; they shifted their focus to Russia’s influence efforts.

During the campaign, intelligence analysts were most concerned about the potential for Russia to hack into election systems and change votes.

But after the election, analysts determined that Russia had largely abandoned its efforts to use cyber to directly hack the election infrastructure. Instead, intelligence officials began more closely examining Moscow’s efforts to influence the election through social media campaigns and, most critically, by releasing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee.

Neither Mr. Nguyen nor his other intelligence officers were directly involved in producing the Intelligence Community Assessment, according to former officials.

The effort to draft the assessment was rushed, with President Barack Obama wanting the work completed before he left office.

Mr. Nguyen had no involvement in the judgment that Republicans have taken issue with: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia favored Mr. Trump’s election.

In any case, most of the analytic work was done at the C.I.A., not at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where Mr. Nguyen worked, according to former officials.

In attacking Ms. Cook, the first Black woman to ever serve as a Fed governor, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pulte signaled anew their willingness to weaponize the instruments of government to influence monetary policy, even though experts long have warned that interfering with the Fed and its independence could bring about catastrophic economic and financial consequences.

The attacks fit a broader pattern for Mr. Trump and his top aides, who have increasingly targeted their political rivals, subjecting them at times to withering investigations and other forms of political retribution.

Mr. Pulte, despite holding what is typically a relatively low-profile role in the administration, has been particularly aggressive, leveling similar mortgage-fraud allegations against Adam Schiff, a U.S. senator who led congressional inquiries into Mr. Trump during his first term, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, who won a civil fraud trial against Mr. Trump before he returned to office.

In a statement released by the Fed on Wednesday evening, Ms. Cook said she had learned about Mr. Pulte’s allegations from media reports, and noted that the mortgage applications were from before she joined the Fed board.

“I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” she said in the statement. “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”

A Justice Department official confirmed the agency had received the referral.

When it comes to the Fed, Mr. Trump’s goal is to force down interest rates, which he believes will boost the economy and make repaying the government’s debt less expensive. The Fed has instead kept its benchmark borrowing costs steady this year, in part because officials are concerned that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will prompt a new round of price increases.

To achieve his goal, the president has embarked on an all-out campaign to pressure the Fed and its members, relentlessly lambasting its chair, Jerome H. Powell, and threatening to fire him, while also trying to subject the central bank to uncomfortable public scrutiny.

Mr. Trump recently seized on renovations underway at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, which are running around $700 million over budget and are expected to cost around $2.5 billion. The president visited the construction site in July after questioning whether there was evidence of fraud given the project’s swelling expenses. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to allow a “major lawsuit” against the Fed chair related to the renovations to go forward as he again called for lower borrowing costs.

The president is limited in his ability to remove an official from the central bank, a protection recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. Policymakers on the Board of Governors can be removed only for “cause,” which legal experts define as breaking the law or gross misconduct.

Ms. Cook has consistently voted with Mr. Powell and is generally seen as aligned with him on policy decisions. Ousting Ms. Cook, whose term as governor runs through 2038, would give Mr. Trump another seat on the seven-member board that he could fill with someone more likely to support cutting rates.

Mr. Trump already has had one seat to fill. Adriana Kugler, another Fed governor, resigned unexpectedly this month, several months before her term was set to expire in January. Mr. Trump has said he plans to nominate Stephen Miran, currently the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill out Ms. Kugler’s term. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate.

The White House has also started weighing potential replacements for Mr. Powell, whose term as chair ends in May. On Tuesday, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said there were “11 very strong candidates” under consideration, and told CNBC that he would begin meeting with them around Sept. 1 to narrow the list.

The chair has historically exerted significant influence over monetary policy decisions. But officially the position has just one of 12 votes on the Fed’s policymaking Open Market Committee, which is made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors and a rotating group of five of the presidents of the Fed’s 12 regional banks.

Two existing governors, Christopher J. Waller and Michelle W. Bowman, were appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term. So if Mr. Trump were able to replace both Ms. Cook and Ms. Kugler, he would have appointed a majority of the board. The governors, in turn, must approve candidates to lead the regional Fed banks, although it isn’t clear whether they could immediately force out existing presidents.

A specialist in international economics who has researched racial disparities in labor markets, Ms. Cook was a professor at Michigan State University when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appointed her to the Fed board in 2022.

Her confirmation was a narrow one: Vice President Kamala Harris broke a 50-50 tie in the Senate after Republicans voted overwhelmingly against her appointment.

One of the most prominent Black women in a field long dominated by white men, Ms. Cook has been an advocate for diversity in economics. She helped lead the American Economic Association’s summer program, which helps prepare students from underrepresented backgrounds for graduate programs in the social sciences.

In a letter posted Wednesday to social media, Mr. Pulte revealed that the housing agency had been investigating Ms. Cook on suspicion of mortgage fraud. It was the latest instance in which Mr. Pulte, a key political ally of the president, had personally targeted a member of the Fed; earlier, he helped stoke suspicion around Mr. Powell and drafted a letter for Mr. Trump firing the chair. The president ultimately opted not to dismiss Mr. Powell.

Mr. Pulte said his inquiry had found that Ms. Cook obtained loans for two homes in 2021 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Atlanta and indicated that both would be her primary residence. Ms. Cook later listed the latter dwelling for rent in 2022, according to Mr. Pulte, who cited “online records,” claiming she did not report any rental income on her ethics filings at the time.

In her most recent financial disclosure, Ms. Cook listed three mortgages, all of which she obtained in 2021, with interest rates ranging from 2.5 to 3.25 percent. She reported receiving income from rent on her residence in Ann Arbor in reports filed in 2024 and 2025.

Mr. Pulte echoed Mr. Trump’s calls for Ms. Cook to resign, posting at one point on X: “How can this woman be in charge of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?”

Mr. Trump has himself been found liable for lying to lenders to secure more favorable interest rates. A judge in New York last year found that Mr. Trump had inflated his net worth on loan applications, and imposed a fine of about $450 million, including interest. Mr. Trump has appealed the ruling.

“He’s a war hero, because we work together. He’s a war hero,” Mr. Trump said of the Israeli leader. “I guess I am too,” he added.

Israel in mid-June launched waves of airstrikes against Iran, hitting important nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan. It killed much of the country’s military chain of command along with several nuclear scientists. Then, on June 22, the United States used large bombs to strike the Iranian nuclear site at Fordo, which is buried under a mountain.

A recent U.S. assessment described Fordo as badly damaged, although it is difficult to precisely gauge the extent without access to the site.

During the interview, Mr. Trump also took credit for the return of hostages held in Gaza who have been freed since his election victory in November.

Hamas freed around 30 hostages during a cease-fire that began just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January, and another captive was released in May on the eve of the president’s visit to the Middle East.

They were among 240 hostages taken during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that set off the war in Gaza. About 105 hostages were freed during an earlier cease-fire, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. was president.

“I’m the one that got all the hostages back,” Mr. Trump said.

The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defense minister, in November 2024, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel has rejected the accusations, and the State Department in June imposed sanctions on four of the court’s judges in response to the warrants.

Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has frequently taken credit for resolving conflicts including those between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, between India and Pakistan and between Thailand and Cambodia. He also announced the cease-fire between Iran and Israel that ended the nearly two weeks of back-and-forth strikes in June.

In the interview with Mr. Levin, Mr. Trump said: “I’ve settled six wars, and we did Iran, and I wiped out their total nuclear capability, which they would have used against Israel in two seconds if they had the chance.” He compared that record favorably with those of his Democratic predecessors.

Iran has long said that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes. Though its ability to enrich uranium, which is needed for a nuclear weapon, was set back significantly by the U.S. and Israeli attacks, some experts believe that Tehran could eventually resume enrichment at other sites.

In response to the interview, Iran’s Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with the country’s Revolutionary Guard, on Wednesday described Mr. Trump’s remarks on Iran as “incoherent.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled the plans Aug. 19 in a news conference in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, while workers ran paint rollers up the steel bollards behind her.

When asked about the possibility that critics might call the heat-inducing paint job cruel, Noem said: ""Don’t touch it.""

Noem said the request to paint it black came from President Donald Trump.

""Too high to climb. Too narrow to squeeze through. And now, at the President's direction, it will be painted black – so hot to the touch that criminal illegal aliens won’t even try,"" Noem said in a post on X.

As USA TODAY has previously reported, hundreds of miles of 30-foot barrier at the border already pose a deadly threat to migrants who attempt to scale the fence.

Still, thousands of migrants have tried since President Donald Trump ordered construction of the 30-foot barrier during his first term.

During a historic period of migration following the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2022, the county hospital in El Paso, Texas, treated 326 people for injuries – or nearly one per day.

Some of the injuries were catastrophic: Nine people died that year after falling from the fence, which is roughly the height of a three-story building. From 2000 to 2019 – before the higher barrier was erected – the hospital registered a single death resulting from a fall from the border fence.

Coyote smugglers have taken to throwing rope ladders over the 30-foot barrier or using steel rods shaped to hook over the fence. Increasingly, they're tunnelling under the barrier.

Noem didn't tell reporters how much the paint job will cost. She praised Trump's war on illegal immigration, which Noem said has resulted in ""the most secure border in our nation's history.""

Illegal crossings have fallen dramatically border-wide under Trump's crackdown.

Migrant apprehensions have plummeted to fewer than 8,000 in July, compared with more than 104,000 during the same month a year ago, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

In El Paso Sector, which includes West Texas and New Mexico, interim Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar said the seven-day average for apprehensions currently sits at around nine, compared with around 400 at the same time last year.

She and her attorneys filed a lawsuit hoping the judge would compel police to enforce the city's noise ordinances and crack down on criminal activity near the ICE building.

Attorney Julie Parrish said for more than 70 days, her client, Cloud Elvengrail, has put up with yelling, loud bangs and people pounding on her door. Parrish said Judge Ellen Rosenblum's bench ruling essentially left matters up to the police officers' discretion, even though the judge felt for the plaintiff.

Parrish said the ruling was disappointing for Elvengrail who believes the city's noise ordinance from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. should apply to the noise she hears most nights.

""I don't think what we were asking for was unreasonable,"" said Parrish. ""We filed a writ of mandamus asking a judge to compel Portland police to do their job.""

Parrish believes police may be taking a cue from city leadership by allowing certain criminal activity by protesters to slide.

KGW contacted police and the city for reaction to the judge's decision.

Press officer Cody Bowman with Mayor Keith Wilson's office sent a statement saying, ""The City is grateful for the Court's thoughtful consideration of this matter.""

Parrish said a lot of complaint calls to 911 could be prevented with more policing at the ICE building.

""It's a cyclical pattern,"" she said, ""every night, the rioter protesters are acting well beyond what free speech laws allow. They're violating all types of time, place and manner restrictions.""

Parrish said they are not giving up the fight, especially since it's not just her client, but others in the building who may be suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

A fellow tenant at Gray's Landing apartments said he's concerned for his neighbors who are veterans.

In a letter sent to the local ICE field office Tuesday, the Sacramento City Council and Sacramento County Board Chairman Phil Serna said they had received reports of confined individuals held in “abhorrent conditions” at the John E. Moss federal building. Those conditions allegedly include limited water and food and a lack of access to restrooms and air conditioning.

“In light of this situation, we are requesting transparency on the conditions of the detained individuals … as well as access to tour the facilities to ensure the humane conditions and treatment of these individuals,” officials wrote in the letter.

The letter follows several reports from NorCal Resist that immigrants are being held overnight as part of their detainment. The organization, which has spent months monitoring arrests at the federal building, said there are estimates of more than 20 people who have been held in these conditions.

“It is important to note that this building was not designed for overnight stays,” said Giselle Garcia, programs director for NorCal Resist. “We denounce this practice and advocate for the immediate release of these community members.”

ICE, in an email statement on Friday, said the “query will be researched” but could not respond before The Sacramento Bee’s deadline when asked about NorCal Resist’s allegations. The agency did not respond to multiple follow-up emails this week.

Councilmember Eric Guerra, who spearheaded the letter, said he is hoping for an immediate response that allows elected officials to review the conditions of the facility.

“If someone is being held in unsanitary or unhealthy conditions, days matter and hours matter,” Guerra said.

The alleged conditions at the Sacramento federal building mirror recent accounts and videos that immigrants across the country are being kept inside immigration offices for consecutive days. In many cases, these offices are designed to only hold people for a few hours.

A Peruvian immigrant filed a lawsuit denouncing the unsanitary and overcrowded conditions in New York earlier this month, according to The New York Times.

The center launched an oversight program, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to provide states with reports of individuals enrolled in Medicaid who do not appear on federal databases.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

States are required to review the federal reports, identify immigration status discrepancies, request information and enforce noncitizen eligibility rules.

Federal law typically does not allow noncitizens to enroll in Medicaid. However, 1.4 million people are enrolled in Medicaid who do not meet citizenship and immigration status requirements, according to data from the Congressional Budget Office.

Some states, like California, Oregon and Colorado, have extended Medicaid eligibility to undocumented immigrants, which accounts for the large number of recipients. It is unclear how cooperation will go between states who have expanded Medicaid enrollment.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” said CMS administrator Mehmet Oz.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law July 4, implemented tighter restrictions on Medicaid eligibility including a crackdown on work requirements for able-bodied adults, frequent eligibility redeterminations and increased restrictions on noncitizens.

The move from the health department comes as the Trump administration has worked to share more data on individuals enrolled in Medicaid. The health department first gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to enrollment records for individuals on Medicaid in June.

Twenty states, including California, Colorado and New York, filed a lawsuit against the department in July. A federal judge temporarily blocked the health agency from sharing information in those states last week.

Advocates with Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants demanded action from state lawmakers after several Connecticut cities have seen a surge in the presence of federal immigration officers.

The rally took place less than a two minute walk from the same location where dozens of ICE officers gathered and detained two individuals on the Danbury courthouse steps earlier this month.

In a statement released on Wednesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Boston confirmed that 65 people were apprehended by ICE in Connecticut over a four-day span this month.

“The state of Connecticut is a safer place thanks to the hard work and determination of the men and women of ICE and our federal partners,” said Patricia H. Hyde, the acting director of Boston’s ICE field office. She noted that many of those who were arrested had “significant criminality.”

Federal officials said 29 of the people arrested during the operation, called “Operation Broken Trust,” were charged or convicted of serious crimes, such as kidnapping, assault, drug offenses, weapons violations and sex crimes. Others had criminal histories in their native countries or were identified as members of gangs, ICE officials said.

Family members of one of these taken individuals spoke at the rally in Danbury.

Edwin Andres Calva-Guaman was taken into ICE custody last week at the Danbury Superior Courthouse, according to his sister Monica Apolinario.

Apolinario addressed the crowd at the rally in Spanish with her son and Calva-Gauman’s nephew, 3-year-old Axel, standing next to her.

“[Calva-Guaman’s] lawyer told him to go to the Danbury Superior Courthouse because he supposedly had a court date. I showed up in court to ask why he had to attend, but in actuality, he didn't have a court date. We don't know why they summoned him, and we don't know where they took him,” Apolinario said in Spanish. “I just came [to the rally] to let you all know so that all of those who have court dates are cautious with immigration.”

Calva-Guaman’s girlfriend of three years, Jossie Gutierrez, stood with her. Through tears, Gutierrez said in Spanish that Calva-Gauman is the main provider for his sister, his nephews and his mother who is back in their home country of Ecuador.

“His mother has no consolation, crying because she doesn’t know where her son is. We don’t know where he is, how he is… nothing,” Gutierrez said in Spanish. “Unfortunately, his nephew, who was like his brother, was killed because they deported him back to his home country. He got to his home country just to be killed. That’s what we don’t want to happen to [Calva-Guaman], so please let’s get together and raise our voices so that this ends.”

In the ICE statement on Operation Broken Trust, ICE officials said, “Calva-Guaman’s criminal history includes a conviction for larceny and arrest for domestic violence, assault 3rd degree and breach of peace.”

According to the pending cases docket on the State of Connecticut Judicial Branch website, Calva-Gauman is awaiting disposition for eight misdemeanors, including two charges of third degree assault, one charge of fifth degree larceny and one charge of second degree breach of peace. He is also awaiting disposition for two class D felonies of a violation of a protective order.

All of the offenses took place last year. Calva-Gauman pleaded not guilty on all charges and has a court date scheduled in December.

‘Are you ready to fight?’

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal was met with pushback when he spoke at the rally in Danbury on Wednesday.

After introducing him to the crowd, organizer and co-founder of Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants Juan Fonseca Tapia spoke to U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal directly.

“We know you condemned this fascist administration and the terror inflicted on our community,” Fonseca Tapia said. “We know that. But on behalf of my community, I am asking you, what are you going to do to keep our families safe?”

When Sen. Blumenthal responded by asking the crowd if they were ready to fight, several individuals in the crowd shouted back, “Are you?”

Blumenthal said he was ready.

“Now I cannot order anything,” Blumenthal said. “You understand, I’m in the minority in the United States Senate, but I can begin an investigation that will bring into light who should be held accountable, and I’m going to do it.”

In response to the uptick in ICE activity, Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants has organized a petition with demands for state elected officials. Carolina Bortolleto, a member of the community-based group, said she and other advocates are calling on lawmakers to take action in a special session. It is currently unclear if the Connecticut legislature will reconvene for a special session this fall.

According to the petition, the group is calling on Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature to strengthen Connecticut’s TRUST Act, a law that limits how local law enforcement cooperates with federal immigration officials.

Changes to the TRUST Act passed earlier this year and going into effect this fall expand on crimes that qualify for cooperation with federal immigration officials, but also allow residents to file a lawsuit against municipal police departments that violate the law.

Hyde of Boston’s ICE field office criticized the law in her statement.

“Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut’s Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect,” Hyde said, noting that the act forces law enforcement to release people “back into the very communities they have already victimized.”

Responding to advocate concerns

While the TRUST Act already prevents state and local law enforcement from assisting ICE except in cases of serious crimes, the Danbury advocates’ petition seeks to further limit the sharing of personal information by public agencies with federal immigration officials. The law also prohibits Connecticut’s National Guard from participating in federal immigration enforcement – a tactic used recently in Los Angeles.

However, the TRUST Act does not prohibit federal immigration officers from detaining individuals inside courthouses, a change that advocates proposed during the legislative process this spring. Petitioners also want lawmakers to prohibit ICE arrests at courthouses, including while people travel to and leave the courthouse, as the state has seen at recent arrests in Fairfield County.

The petition also calls on city officials in Danbury to prevent local law enforcement from assisting ICE in cases such as using city property without a warrant, setting up traffic perimeters, and sharing surveillance footage.

It also asks city officials to ensure local schools host family preparedness workshops. While the state of Connecticut put out guidance for K-12 public schools on immigration activities in late January, immigration advocates are also calling on the city of Danbury to create a response plan for when ICE presence is reported outside school zones and hospitals.

The demands come as the City of Danbury and several cities in Fairfield County have been swarmed with ICE presence in recent weeks.

ICE presence in and around Danbury

According to Carolina Bortolleto, ICE presence has been a weekly occurrence in the city of Danbury for two months straight.

On Saturday, August 2, the group raised the alarm of ICE officers dressing up as construction workers to conduct their operations just across the state line between Danbury, Connecticut, and Brewster, New York.

Then, on Thursday August 14, Bortolleto said dozens of ICE officers gathered at the Danbury Courthouse and detained two individuals from the courthouse steps.

Video taken of the incident shows an alleged ICE officer pulling out a taser after a confrontation between advocates and ICE officers escalated in the parking lot. When asked for a name and badge number, one individual in a green shirt, jeans and face covering quickly flashed an apparent badge hanging off his jeans.

ICE arrests in Stamford Courthouse

In Stamford, federal officers were seen taking two men into custody inside the state courthouse on Monday, August 11.

According to Rhonda Herbert, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Judicial Branch, public safety officials are not to prevent or assist ICE in any apprehensions in the courthouse under the Trust Act. However, former Connecticut state representative David Michel said it was previously thought that arrests only occurred outside the court building in Stamford.

Stamford and Norwalk residents organized a rally a few days later to speak out against the recent ICE arrests in their communities.

Then, Democratic State Rep. Corey Paris of Stamford began to receive death threats over the weekend, after the official ICE X account on social media shared a post criticizing Paris for putting information online about a heightened presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in his House district.

Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons and Police Chief Timothy Shaw put out a joint written statement on August 19 regarding the increase in ICE activity.

The statement read, “The City of Stamford is a welcoming and inclusive community, and the recent activity by ICE officials does not align with our commitment to ensure that all residents are treated with dignity and respect—regardless of immigration status or background. Consistent with state law, the Stamford Police Department operates in full compliance with the Connecticut TRUST Act, which defines and limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials. The Stamford Police Department does not assist ICE, except in cases involving serious crimes.”

ICE activity condemned in Norwalk

Norwalk officials have also spoken out against the ICE activity recently seen in their city.

According to a statement from Mayor Rilling, the Norwalk Police Chief and the Common Council, ICE officers used the Norwalk Police Department parking lot on Thursday, August 14 and Friday, August 15 without prior authority or consent. The statement said police department officials asked the ICE officers to leave the parking lot on both occasions.

Mayor Harry Rilling condemned these actions in a press conference on Friday, August 15

“We want to first make it clear that immigration customs enforcement were not invited to Norwalk. They were not invited to use any facility in the city of Norwalk, including the police department parking lot which we found rather inappropriate,” Rilling said in the press conference.

More CT elected officials speak out

Stamford State Representative Matt Blumenthal took to social media on Saturday, August 16 to say “ICE in Connecticut is completely out of control.”

In a video, Blumenthal addressed the courthouse incident in Stamford and the ICE presence in Norwalk.

“These violent lawless and frankly unprofessional intimidation tactics by ICE are detrimental to the administration of justice and public safety,"" Blumenthal said.

In a statement, ICE officials said they made arrests as part of this month’s four-day operation in Connecticut “after local jurisdictions refused to honor immigration detainer requests to turn over the offenders forcing ICE officers and agents to make at-large arrests in Connecticut communities.”

Blumenthal noted that there are other ways for federal immigration agents to do their work.

“If ICE wants to detain people they view as dangerous who are in our courthouses, they have a simple remedy: Get a damn warrant,” Blumenthal said.

Blumenthal said he and his colleagues are “investigating mechanisms for the state to reassert control over its courthouses, including by preventing federal immigration enforcement from entering without a judicial warrant to make arrests.”

Gov. Ned Lamont condemned federal immigration officers on Tuesday, August 19 for carrying out their operations and arrests at local courthouses, saying it threatened public safety. The statements were made in a letter sent to US Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“When the federal government detains people at state courthouses, it is harder for prosecutors, public defenders, police, and judges to do their jobs,” Lamont wrote. “These measures create fear among Connecticut residents, including witnesses, victims and families, about going to court or contacting the police to report criminal activity.”

Tired of hope and prayers

After the rally, an advocate identified as Ixmucane walked over to the sidewalk to wave a sign of people who have allegedly died in ICE custody at cars passing by.

Ixmucane, who was born and raised in Guatemala, refrained from sharing her last name and hometown out of concern for her personal safety.

“I want the elected officials to get out of their comfort zone and realize that they are representing all of us as a community,” she said.

Ixmucane said she wants to hold both Connecticut’s elected officials and advocates who attend these rallies accountable.

“I don't want to talk about hope. I don't want to talk about prayers. I am tired of those two words,” Ixmucane said. “I want actions.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93b97c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7550x3964+0+535/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F2a%2F40781fd34a67914009f74d638a7d%2F250820danburyice-mma4647.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 20:57:00.498394

Written in both English and Spanish, the fliers tell people what to do if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents try to arrest immigrants near schools.

Rene Zambrano, a Lincoln High School teacher and member of the San Diego immigrant advocacy group Unión del Barrio, recruited a few students to distribute fliers Tuesday morning while he spoke to concerned parents dropping off their kids.

“Let me give you some information, we’re doing some awareness against ICE,” Zambrano told a dad driving a mini van. “We want to tell the community that it’s safe to come to school.”

Unión del Barrio and another local group, the Association of Raza Educators, trained approximately 100 teachers over the summer break. This comes as demand for know-your-rights information is high — especially after ICE agents detained parents near schools in Chula Vista and Linda Vista earlier this month.

After the Linda Vista arrest, San Diego Unified District superintendent Fabiola Bagula criticized federal immigration enforcement near schools.

“Let me be clear: Our schools and our neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this.”

News reports show similar arrests near schools in Oregon, Texas, Illinois and South Carolina.

Concerned among activists about school arrests has grown ever since the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected certain areas like schools, churches and hospitals from immigration enforcement.

In recent emails to KPBS, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the arrests of parents near school San Diego area campuses, but maintains agents are not actively targeting schools.

In response to community concern over recent ICE actions, Unión del Barrio and Association of Raza Educators are launching “teacher patrols” throughout San Diego. The patrols involve volunteers driving around campuses looking for undercover ICE agents and teachers welcoming students outside of schools.

Erendira Ramirez, a local teacher and member of Raza Educators, said volunteers are trained to document ICE sightings and alert the community so people who are afraid of getting arrested can avoid the area.

She criticized arrests near schools.

“That’s unacceptable,” she said.

In January, the SDUSD passed a resolution stating staff will not help ICE enforce federal immigration law and won’t allow access to school facilities unless federal agents have a warrant.

The district’s website has links to resources available to immigrant students and their families, including what to do in case there’s a deportation in the family.

In a statement Tuesday, a San Diego Unified spokesperson said educators in the district can volunteer with immigrant rights groups in their free time. The statement went on the say the following:

The Trump administration issued the new screening rules in two separate notices this month, granting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers wide discretion to deny immigrants legal residency or citizenship.

The changes, which don't specifically define what constitutes ""anti-American activity,"" build on the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on people entering the country – including through legal avenues.

""America's benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,"" USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.

Civil rights advocates say the new guidance are subject to interpretation and risk turning immigration officers into ""thought police.""

According to the new guidance, USCIS will expand its use of social media vetting for certain immigration benefits, as officers search for evidence of ""anti-American"" or antisemitic content. Effective immediately, it applies to people applying for a student or worker visa, or a green card.

Separately, USCIS said Aug. 15 that it will put citizenship applicants through ""a holistic assessment"" of behavior, including judging their ""adherence to societal norms and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.""

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the criteria for determining ""anti-American ideologies"" and ""good moral character"" are vague and risk further bogging down an already overburdened legal immigration system.

""We don't really know how it will be enforced,"" he told USA TODAY, adding that, for the Trump administration, ""the goal is to slow down immigration and reduce the number of people coming in by any means necessary.""

Robert McCaw, government affairs director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he sees an anti-Palestinian bias in the new rules that amount to ""ideological tests.""

""Immigrants should not have to choose between their immigration status and their conscience,"" he said.

The Trump administration has sought to deport multiple student protesters who support Palestinian rights amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, calling some demonstrations antisemitic.

USCIS reviews hundreds of thousands of applications for work permits, legal permanent residency cards and naturalization each year. The agency already collects applicants' biometrics and makes an exhaustive review of their eligibility, including screening out applicants with ties to terrorism.

Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs and policy at the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies, said immigration officers have typically checked for ties to terrorism in their applications reviews.

In a chaotic street scene caught on video, the agents pulled out batons and tasers and tackled several protesters to the ground, detaining at least one.

As has become routine, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested an asylum-seeker after a hearing at San Francisco’s immigration court, and were transporting them to their headquarters a half-mile away when protesters intervened.

ICE officers encountered about 20 people who had gathered outside the court at 100 Montgomery St. Immigrants legally seeking asylum have been routinely arrested after their court hearings and flown to far-flung detention centers, and protesters often congregate outside court.

Witnesses said the two sides squared off — protesters trying to stop the vehicles, and ICE agents trying to get through.

“This car has ICE in it!” one protester yelled. “ICE is not welcome in San Francisco!” said another through a bullhorn, as protesters stood in front of a silver mini-van holding signs reading “Stop your car to block ICE.”

Video shows masked ICE agents disembarking from the mini-van and wielding batons to push the protesters aside.

“The protesters and the ICE agents were facing off … and there were probably like 30-40 passers by, stopped, staring, filming,” said Zenobia Pellissier Lloyd, a freelance photographer and former Mission Local intern. Pellissier Lloyd said traffic and a Muni bus had effectively blocked the ICE vehicles in. The ICE vehicles then turned around and sped down a one-way street, she said.

Video shows the protesters then chasing the van down the street.

About a dozen ICE agents headed towards 630 Sansome St., the ICE headquarters about a half mile away, followed by protesters. Pellissier Lloyd said the crowd shouted after them.

“It was just ‘Shame! Shame! Shame!’ Someone had a megaphone saying, ‘These are ICE agents kidnapping our neighbors,” she said. “It was just a lot of, ‘What are you so afraid of? … How do you sleep at night? What will your children think of you?’”

The ICE agents were “holding each other’s arms, hands on each other’s shoulders, saying “Stay close, stay close,” Pellissier Lloyd said. “They were blocking cameras, they were randomly lashing out at people … They all had their weapons out, tasers ready.”

Several videos show ICE agents tussling with protesters, tackling at least four to the ground, zip tying several, and pointing their tasers. At one point, an ICE agent “decides to turn and pepper-spray four people,” Pellissier Lloyd said, about a block from the ICE headquarters.

One of them was a reporter with the online news site Gazetteer, who wrote that he was hit directly and “fell to the ground.”

“In a literal second, the agent pulled out his pepper gel, sprayed the protester next to me, and then shot a stream straight into my eyes,” the reporter, Eddie Kim, wrote.

Once the ICE agents arrived at HQ, “I turned and saw one protester on the ground, two ICE agents on top of them, and then dragging them into 630 Sansome,” Pellissier Lloyd said.

Mission Local has reached out to ICE for comment.

Wednesday’s detention marks the second time the Department of Homeland Security has detained a protester in San Francisco recently. On August 8, ICE detained two protesters outside of the field office on Sansome.

Both of the people detained earlier this month were U.S. citizens. It was unclear if the protester detained on Wednesday was.

On Wednesday afternoon, the chaos outside could be felt inside the courtrooms as well.

Mission Local did not see any arrests at afternoon hearings. But one family was visibly shaken.

An asylum-seeker who appeared with two family members — including a child — asked the judge hearing his case, Arwen Swink, if he could appear by video for his next hearing.

“This is very tense for us,” he told Swink in Spanish through an interpreter. “This is the first day I feel afraid.”

A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security objected, citing department policy.

In recent months, asylum-seekers have been increasingly trying to appear remotely because of the arrests at San Francisco’s courtrooms.

Swink pushed back on the Homeland Security attorney.

There is “value” to in-person hearings, Swink said. But, the judge added, “many, many” immigrants have said they are afraid.

“The court does not condone using these facilities for any purposes that would generate fear,” Swink said, quickly adding the attorney himself may not be intending to do so.

Swink granted the man’s request to appear remotely in the future.

“Amen,” he said.

Immigrants like the man who was arrested this morning who are able to quickly connect with an attorney are sometimes released on habeas corpus petitions, which argue, often successfully in California, that their detention is a violation of their due process rights.",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-0820-8.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 20:57:13.779379

The rally is being organized by several civil rights and Indivisible groups from across the state, and is planned for two locations: Cold Stream Dam and Philipsburg Memorial Park. In addition to drawing awareness to the facility that’s privately owned by the Florida-based GEO Group, organizers of the rally will continue to demand the Clearfield County Commissioners end the contract between the county, ICE and the GEO Group. The contract is set to run out in 2026.

Bobbi Erickson, co-founder of Indivisible: Mayday of Brockport in Elk County, attended Monday night’s Philipsburg Borough Council meeting to notify council members about the planned protest, which she expects to draw hundreds.

Attendees are expected to take buses from the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas, Erickson said, and include those who are traveling to support their community members, family members and other loved ones that are currently incarcerated in the center.

“We have a very long track record of keeping everybody at our rallies safe,” Erickson said. “We always have legal observers at our rallies; we’re committed to non-violence and we always leave the area exactly how we found it.”

Sunday’s rally follows a protest that drew about 50 people late last month and had the goal of bringing more attention to the rural facility, which is tucked into the woods of Morris Township, Clearfield County. A record average of 1,340 people were at the detention center as of June 23, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data distribution organization founded at Syracuse University.

Calls for the facility’s closure intensified earlier this month when Chaofeng Ge, a 32-year-old Chinese national, was found dead by the facility’s staff, hanging by his neck in the shower room of his detention pod. It marked the second death at the facility, with the first being 37-year-old Cameroonian man Frankline Okpu in 2023.

In addition to the two deaths, potential abuses at “Black Bear Alcatraz,” as it’s been dubbed by Erickson, have concerned immigration and civil rights activists since the facility opened in 2021.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and two other advocacy groups filed a complaint last year with the Department of Homeland Security after hearing from frustrated and fearful people detained there. The complaint detailed what they consider inhumane, unconstitutional and punitive conditions.

“I was horrified when I found out that this facility existed, and had so many documented reports of human rights violations and due process violations,” Erickson said Monday. “I am a patriot, I believe in the Constitution, I believe in what America stands for, I believe what’s written on our Statute of Liberty, and that is why I’m taking up action to try and help the individuals in the facility that deserve our help.”

Despite the documented abuses, ICE has mostly rejected such findings. In a news release focused on Ge, it wrote, “ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”

Currently, the facility has a capacity of 1,876, employs hundreds and costs millions to operate.

After sharing the plans for Sunday’s rally with Philipsburg Borough Council, council members raised some concerns about worship groups at the park that day and limited parking. Erickson said that buses from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh would park at one of the nearby Walmart Supercenters in State College or Clearfield after dropping people off.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco granted the administration an emergency stay pending appeal, in a setback for immigrant rights groups who contend the government acted unlawfully in terminating TPS designations for nationals of Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal.

""The district court's order granting plaintiffs' motion to postpone, entered July 31, 2025, is stayed pending further order of this court,"" the panel of judges wrote.

Temporary Protected Status is a humanitarian program that allows migrants from countries hit by war, natural disasters or political instability to remain in the United States and obtain work permits. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has moved to curtail the program, arguing that conditions in certain countries no longer justify the designations. The administration has cast TPS restrictions as part of a broader strategy to expand deportations and narrow avenues for immigrants to remain in the country.

Last month, Noem ordered to end TPS for 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans, saying their countries had recovered sufficiently from Hurricane Mitch, which devastated Central America in 1998. Those protections are set to expire Sept. 8, after more than two decades of legal work status for many of the migrants. TPS for an estimated 7,000 Nepalis is slated to end Aug. 5.

Immigrant advocacy groups sharply criticized the administration's actions. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco had earlier ruled in favor of TPS holders, keeping protections in place while the case proceeds. In her July 31 order, she concluded the administration ended TPS ""without an objective review of the country conditions,"" citing ongoing political violence in Honduras and recent destructive storms in Nicaragua. A follow-up hearing is scheduled for Nov. 18.

In response, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin defended the administration's stance. ""TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades,"" she said.

The National TPS Alliance, a coalition representing TPS holders, has argued that Secretary Noem's decisions were unlawful, claiming they were driven by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and ""motivated by racial animus.""

Government attorneys countered that the administration is entitled to set immigration policy. Drew Ensign, a U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, told the court Tuesday that the government suffers ""irreparable harm"" from its ""inability to carry out the programs that it has determined are warranted.""

The Trump administration has already ended TPS for more than a million immigrants, including about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, over 160,000 Ukrainians, and thousands from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some of those decisions remain tied up in lawsuits. In May, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the administration to terminate protections for Venezuelans, issuing no rationale in its brief order, as is common in emergency appeals.

How Many People Have Been Deported Under Trump in 2025?

According to official accounts, the Trump administration claimed approximately 140,000 deportations by April 2025. In the first 100 days of his second term, more than 139,000 individuals were reported removed. A Guardian analysis reveals that over 127,000 people have been deported since January, including more than 8,100 to countries not their own, some involuntarily sent to dangerous regions. The administration has aimed high—with discussions of deporting one million individuals in a year—but so far, the number remains far below that target, projected at about 212,000 for the full year.

The Latest on Trump's Immigration Policy

The Trump administration has aggressively expanded immigration enforcement across multiple fronts in 2025. New policies include vetting immigrants for ""anti-American"" views, giving USCIS broad discretion to deny legal residency or citizenship based on political beliefs or social media activity. Interior enforcement has intensified with detainees in ICE custody exceeding 55,000, far above congressional funding, and daily arrests have surged—some days nearing 2,000 targets—marking a 268% rise in ICE arrests compared with mid–2024. Additionally, detention infrastructure has expanded with new facilities like Nebraska's ""Cornhusker Clink"", part of a broader campaign featuring detention centers such as ""Alligator Alcatraz"" and ""Speedway Slammer.""

Immigration advocates in D.C. say now any brush with law enforcement could be disastrous for migrants.","Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and other officials in Washington, D.C., say the Trump administration’s crime crackdown is really about exerting power and elevating immigration enforcement — not making D.C. safer.

While top Trump officials say the high-profile deployments have had the immediate effect of stifling crime in the District, local critics are raising questions about both the geographic placement of National Guard troops and federal officers — who have been most prominent in tourist hot spots and other wealthier parts of the city — and the focus of the criminal crackdown.

Of the 556 arrests tallied by the White House since it began increasing federal law enforcement presence on Aug. 7, nearly half of the arrests, 233, have been classified by the administration as migrants without legal status, a White House official said Tuesday.

“I think it makes the point that this is not about D.C. crime,” Bowser said earlier in the week, adding that the administration should be transparent about its intent.

“Nobody is against focusing on driving down any level of violence,” Bowser said. “And so if this is really about immigration enforcement, the administration should make that plain.”

The list of those arrested includes immigrants with alleged criminal histories of assault, kidnapping, burglary and larceny, the White House official said. But it also includes delivery drivers arrested as they tried to pick up food from commercial venues, sparking a backlash from human rights advocates and some D.C. residents.

Fueling the criticisms, the highest profile arrest to date was that of a Justice Department employee accused of throwing a sandwich at an agent of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in a section of the city best known for its vibrant nightlife.

Other high-profile or viral encounters have largely centered on immigration.

Video captured at least five masked agents who refused to answer questions about what agency they were with as they used a stun gun on a delivery driver before placing the man in an unmarked vehicle. When an onlooker said the officers were ruining the country, one federal agent responded “liberals already ruined it.”

In another case, a man captured video of his delivery driver as he was detained just minutes away, arrested by officers after the Arabic speaker was apparently unable to answer questions posed by officers.

The apparent focus on immigration has prompted protests around the city. In one high-profile example, video from Tuesday shows a crowd in the Columbia Heights neighborhood marching behind a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and chanting “ICE go home” until the agents reach their vehicles and leave the area.

The following day, the administration pushed back against the demonstrations, dispatching Vice President Vance, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to Union Station, the transportation hub where National Guard troops have been stationed for days.

Vance touted the National Guard presence as “a great example of what’s possible when you actually have the political willpower to bring law and order and common decency back to the public spaces of the United States of America,” while Miller railed against “stupid white hippies” protesting the crackdown.

Some Democrats say the president has launched the tough-on-crime effort merely to deflect attention away from the ongoing saga surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender who had past ties to Trump and his elite social circle in South Florida.

“Trump is using DC as a stage and DC residents as props in a political play to distract from his Epstein problem,” D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) posted on the social platform X. “This is unacceptable.”

Charles Allen, a D.C. Council member, cast the takeover as a way to assert control and distract from problems within the Trump presidency.

“Authoritarianism, power, and control — what this has all been about — made plain,” he wrote on X last week.

“It might make sense if he’s trying to create compelling TV and distract folks from the real scandals he’s facing, but it doesn’t make our city safer & it’s a dangerous abuse of power and authority,” he added later.

Announcing his D.C. crime crackdown earlier in the month, Trump said it was necessary to combat levels of crime in Washington he portrayed as dystopian. The surge in federal forces would “rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor, and worse,” he said.

But during that announcement, Trump repeatedly turned to the topic of immigration.

“This city will no longer be a sanctuary for illegal alien criminals,” he said.

“We will have full, seamless, integrated cooperation at all levels of law enforcement, and we’ll deploy officers across the District with an overwhelming presence.”

Initially, the administration deployed 800 unarmed National Guard troops, on top of hundreds of other officers across a host of agencies including the FBI, ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Since then, the numbers have grown dramatically, with six GOP-led states sending their National Guard forces to D.C. at the request of the administration, bringing the total to nearly 2,000 various law enforcement officers patrolling D.C. Additionally, the guard members will begin carrying weapons, according to numerous reports.

During a press briefing on Wednesday, Bowser made clear that she doesn’t support the surge of military troops.

“I don’t think the National Guard should be used for law enforcement,” she said. “Calling women from their homes and their jobs and their families — they have to be used on mission-specific items that benefit the nation. I don’t think you have an armed militia in the nation’s capital.”

The D.C. Police Union, which says it represents 3,000 of the city’s law enforcement officers, has hailed the arrival of the federal reinforcements as a necessary step in combating violent crime in the nation’s capital. The union posted numbers on Monday indicating that crime in D.C. plummeted in the first week after Trump announced the law enforcement surge, versus the week prior. Violent crimes, the group said, were down 22 percent over that span, while all crimes were down 8 percent.

Carjackings saw the greatest change, down 83 percent.

“At the direction of @POTUS, our nation’s capital is a SAFER place — and we are just getting started,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted Tuesday on X.

Bondi said the surge has led to the seizure of 76 guns, including nine on Monday night alone.

On Wednesday, Bondi promoted a new campaign from the U.S. Marshals Service offering a $500 reward for information leading to an arrest during the federal surge.

“Together, we will make DC safe again!” she wrote.

Violent crime in D.C., which saw a large spike during the COVID pandemic, has since plummeted even long before Trump’s policing campaign, however, raising questions about the true effectiveness of the federal surge. Offenses related to carjackings, for example, fell from 319 through the first eight months of 2024 to 190 over the same span this year, according to D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department.

Given those trends, Trump’s critics see a more menacing campaign, warning that the militarization of Washington’s streets brings with it an authoritarian air that’s quickly damaged certain businesses. That includes restaurants, which saw a plunge in reservations in the days after the administration’s law enforcement takeover.

“The whole region understands that oppression of people in Washington hurts everybody who lives in our region,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told MSNBC on Tuesday. “We don’t want to see people’s rights being trampled there.”

The crackdown comes as D.C. police officers have been under pressure to do more to assist federal officers with immigration enforcement.

The Metropolitan Police Department has traditionally sought to bar its officers from taking actions based solely on immigration status if someone doesn’t otherwise have a criminal warrant out for their arrest.

But in a move that was later shifted under court scrutiny, Bondi sought to appoint a new D.C. police commissioner while also seeking to unwind D.C. laws limiting police involvement in immigration enforcement.

Immigration advocates in D.C. say now any brush with law enforcement could be disastrous for migrants.

“This disturbing policy strips away the rights and safety of our communities. Even the most common police interactions — such as a traffic violation or reporting a crime — can have life-altering consequences for immigrants, including detention and deportation,” the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights said in a statement before Bondi’s order was tamed by the courts.

“This policy adds to the atmosphere of fear and distrust, perpetuates racial profiling, and criminalizes innocent people.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/washington_federal_enforcement_081425gn09_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-20 19:56:59.854756

“Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health, and violate federal law. We ask that DHS promptly provide critical information for the American public to better understand this detention plan,” wrote the lawmakers to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons, FEMA Acting Administrator David Richardson, and DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari.

A federal judge has currently paused further construction at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ after the Miccosukee Tribe and environmental groups filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the detention facility “threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration.”

“The facility is expected to hold as many as 5,000 people, primarily in a combination of tents and trailers, ‘with no brick-and-mortar construction required.’ Human rights experts have condemned the plan as ‘cruel and inhumane’ by design,” the lawmakers stressed in their letter.

“Construction progressed at ‘turbo speed,’” the lawmakers continued, “and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the ‘hottest parts of the state.’ When Florida legislators visited the detention facility, they found temperatures exceeding 83 degrees in the tents without any detainees.”

“Experts worry this novel state-run immigration detention model will allow Florida to create an ‘independent, unaccountable detention system’ that runs parallel to the federal detention system. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis touted that the facility will ‘cut through’ the standard legal process in federal immigration court, and the state will instead deputize the National Guard and ‘other folks in Florida’ as immigration judges within the facility, to facilitate rapid deportations,” the members of Congress cautioned.

They elaborated, “A Florida-run immigration detention system is particularly troubling given that, according to agency records, Florida has been the site of a whopping 40 percent of all deaths in ICE custody nationwide thus far in 2025. It is especially concerning that immigrants’ rights advocates in Florida have filed a lawsuit alleging that people detained at the facility have been denied access to counsel and ‘effectively have no way to contest their detention.’ With that said, this problematic and seemingly unlawful model may grow to expand beyond Florida: Secretary Noem has said, ‘Florida was unique in what they presented to us, and I would ask every other governor to do the exact same thing.’”

The lawmakers reiterated that ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ threatens human rights, due process, Tribal interests, and the environment. Given the clear and immediate risks posed by the facility, they directed DHS to respond to their questions by no later than the 3rd of September:

Full text of the letter can be found by clicking here and follows below:

Dear Secretary Noem, Acting Director Lyons, Acting Administrator Richardson, and Inspector General Cuffari:

We write regarding the State of Florida, in partnership with the federal government, building an immigration detention facility in the heart of the Everglades, which has been sarcastically dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” Last month, President Trump and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem visited the site. Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health, and violate federal law. We ask that DHS promptly provide critical information for the American public to better understand this detention plan.

The Everglades site was selected precisely because of its remote location and harsh surroundings, which Florida officials reportedly view as “an ideal location to house and transport migrants.” Touting the remote location, officials have suggested that the facility will need minimal security because the area is naturally surrounded by “alligators and pythons,” and fleeing migrants would have “nowhere to hide.” President Trump recently joked that detained individuals who try to escape will likely be eaten by alligators and shrugged while saying that “this is not a nice business.”

The facility is expected to hold as many as 5,000 people, primarily in a combination of tents and trailers, “with no brick-and-mortar construction required.” Human rights experts have condemned the plan as “cruel and inhumane” by design. Construction progressed at “turbo speed,” and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the “hottest parts of the state.” When Florida legislators visited the detention facility, they found temperatures exceeding 83 degrees in the tents without any detainees.

Although the land is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis used emergency powers to take control of the site. Reports suggest that the state of Florida is holding hundreds of people with no criminal record and others with legal immigration status, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) holders. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has stated that it will partner with Florida to detain migrants at the site pending deportation, but it is not clear what role ICE is playing in this detention center.

Experts worry this novel state-run immigration detention model will allow Florida to create an “independent, unaccountable detention system” that runs parallel to the federal detention system. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis touted that the facility will “cut through” the standard legal process in federal immigration court, and the state will instead deputize the National Guard and “other folks in Florida” as immigration judges within the facility, to facilitate rapid deportations.

Fundamentally, a state’s ability to participate in immigration enforcement is limited by the federal Supremacy Clause. The Supreme Court also reiterated that states are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting within its proper authority, has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance. A Florida-run immigration detention system is particularly troubling given that, according to agency records, Florida has been the site of a whopping 40 percent of all deaths in ICE custody nationwide thus far in 2025. It is especially concerning that immigrants’ rights advocates in Florida have filed a lawsuit alleging that people detained at the facility have been denied access to counsel and “effectively have no way to contest their detention.” With that said, this problematic and seemingly unlawful model may grow to expand beyond Florida: Secretary Noem has said, “Florida was unique in what they presented to us, and I would ask every other governor to do the exact same thing.”

Beyond human rights and due process issues, this plan raises serious environmental concerns. The site of the facility, the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, is a little-used airstrip that was initially built to anchor “the world’s largest airport,” but the airport was never built, primarily due to environmental challenges. The location is a highly-sensitive stretch of the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. Over the past 35 years, the federal government and Florida have jointly invested more than $10 billion into the Everglades to restore and protect its delicate ecosystem. Environmental experts warn that the increased activity will pose serious environmental risks—not only for the vulnerable wetlands but for the millions of people who rely on the area for access to freshwater. The vast wetlands are a major water source for more than 10 million South Floridians, with 300 million gallons of fresh water pumped out daily.

Furthermore, Tribal leaders have “denounced” plans to place a detention field on their ancestral lands that are home to 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages and several “ceremonial grounds, burial grounds, and gathering sites.” Not only would the facility harm the “cultural, spiritual and historical identity” of Miccosukee and Florida Seminole people, but tribal leaders have also expressed concerns that disruptions to the environment would negatively impact the ability of nearby tribes to “live, hunt, fish, gather and pray.”

While this detention facility may prove disastrous for human rights, due process, environmental, and Tribal interests, it is poised to be lucrative for private vendors. Reporting suggests that a “team of vendors” may be partnering with Florida officials to manage the facility, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

Given that DHS is working directly with the Florida state government on a detention facility with alarming implications, DHS should ensure transparency and accountability surrounding the facility’s financing operations. Therefore, we ask that you respond to the following questions by September 3, 2025:

Please provide a copy of any memoranda of understanding or other agreements between the state of Florida and DHS (or any of its components) related to the operation of this detention facility.

What legal authority allows the state of Florida to construct and operate any migrant detention facilities?

Please provide a detailed legal reasoning explaining how the cited legal authority allows the state of Florida to construct and operate a migrant detention facility?

Is this detention facility’s construction and operation under the direct control of the Department of Homeland Security as presented in Friends of the Everglades v. Noem (No. 25-22896-CV-WILLIAMS (2025)) or the State of Florda?

Is the facility subject to federal standards for the treatment of detainees, such as the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003 (P.L. 108-79)?

Have there been any inspections of detention standards at this facility since detainees were transferred in? If so, what were the findings?

What is the state licensed and unlicensed staff to detainee ratio? Please disaggregate by license type.

How can detainees file a complaint with the DHS Inspector General?

How can detainees file a complaint with the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties?

How can detainees file a complaint with the DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO)?

How can detainees request medical attention?

What private vendors are being contracted to participate in operating the detention facility?

What oversight mechanisms are being implemented to ensure compliance with federal, state, and international law?

What measures are being taken to ensure access to clean drinking water, food, sewage infrastructure, temperature regulation, and medical care for detained migrants?

Additionally, what measures are being taken to protect migrants from environmental conditions like floods, pests, dangerous animals, extreme heat, and potential hurricanes?

Were any environmental reviews conducted before construction of the facility? If so, what were the findings?

Obama said that while he opposes partisan gerrymandering, Republicans in Texas acting at President Trump’s behest have forced Democrats’ hand.
California’s 52 congressional districts were last redrawn in 2021.
Earlier this summer, Trump urged Texas leaders to redraw its congressional boundaries to increase the number of Republicans in Congress.
Gavin Newsom, California Democrats responded and proposed redrawing the state’s district lines and putting the matter before voters in a special election in November.","Former President Obama endorsed California Democrats’ plans to redraw congressional districts if Texas or another Republican-led state does so to increase the GOP’s chances of maintaining control of Congress after next year’s midterm election.

Obama said that while he opposes partisan gerrymandering, Republicans in Texas acting at President Trump’s behest have forced Democrats’ hand.

If Democrats “don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy,” he said at a fundraiser Tuesday in Martha’s Vineyard that was first reported by the Associated Press on Wednesday.

“I wanted just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas, and take it to the voters and see what happens,” Obama said, “... but we cannot unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game. And California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas.”

Redistricting typically only occurs once a decade, after the census, to account for population shifts. In 2010, Californians voted to create an independent redistricting commission to end partisan gerrymandering. California’s 52 congressional districts were last redrawn in 2021.

Earlier this summer, Trump urged Texas leaders to redraw its congressional boundaries to increase the number of Republicans in Congress. Led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, California Democrats responded and proposed redrawing the state’s district lines and putting the matter before voters in a special election in November.

The issue came to a head this week, with Texas lawmakers expected to vote on their new districts on Wednesday, and California legislators expected to vote on Thursday to call the special election.

Obama called Newsom’s approach “responsible,” because the matter will ultimately be decided by voters, and if approved, would only go into effect if Texas or another state embarks on a mid-decade redistricting, and line-drawing would revert to the independent commission after the 2030 census.

“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach, designed to address a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time,” Obama said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2c574b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4563x2396+0+323/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2F2a%2F5376c4284620af0fed81ae85f8eb%2Felection-2024-harris-93855.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 19:57:07.953201

Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, the student, recently turned 18 years old and was set to begin his senior year of high school last week. He is being held at the Adelanto detention center.

His teacher, Lizette Becerra, spoke at a rally held Tuesday at the Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. She said Guerrero-Cruz detailed to her how the agents said it was, “lucky for him, for them, they would be able to have drinks that weekend.”

Becerra, who taught him English language development when he arrived from Chile in 2023, wondered at the rally whether the agents might be bounty hunters.

The rally was organized by the Association of Raza Educators, Community Self Defense Coalition LA, and Unión del Barrio; they are grassroots organizations that have responded to immigration raids with workshops teaching people’s rights and by patrolling neighborhoods targeted by immigration agents to confirm and record sightings.

Guerrero-Cruz was walking his dog the morning of Aug. 8 when over a dozen men approached, some masked and others in plainclothes, and grabbed him as they called him a name he did not recognize, he told the teacher who visited him.

A neighbor, also an educator, saw when one of the agents unclipped the dog’s collar. She was able to catch the dog and return it to the family.

“For this to happen to Benjamin — it could happen to my son, it could happen to your son, it could happen to your neighbor, it could happen to your student,” said Lupe Carrasco Cardona, an ethnic studies teacher, at the Tuesday rally.

Dubbed ""Operation Broken Trust,"" the sweep netted 29 people who had been convicted or charged in the U.S. with crimes, including kidnapping, assault, weapons violations, drug offenses, and sex crimes, according to ICE.

The federal agency said it targeted transnational organized crime, gangs, and egregious offenders.

""Connecticut is a sanctuary no more,"" a news release from ICE read.

The operation involved ICE Boston’s Hartford field office, the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The sweep took place from Aug. 12-15, ICE said.

Connecticut was one of several states, cities, and counties identified as a sanctuary jurisdiction by the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month.

Local

The Trump administration has pointed to Connecticut's Trust Act as interfering with ICE enforcement actions.

The Trust Act, which was expanded this year, limits state and local police, and others, from arresting or detaining individuals with an immigration detainer except under specific circumstances.

“Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut’s Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect. Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde said in the release. “The state of Connecticut is a safer place thanks to the hard work and determination of the men and women of ICE and our federal partners.""

Gov. Ned Lamont told the Department of Justice Tuesday that his administration will not amend its immigration policies, despite threats of funding cuts and criminal charges.

“As a governor, my focus is on making sure our kids show up at school, or residents participate fully in their democracy, and that all individuals are treated with respect,” he wrote in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Lamont's response came after Bondi sent the state a letter with a deadline to provide details that “confirms your commitment to complying with federal laws and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”

A spokesperson for the governor responded Wednesday to news of the operation.

“Connecticut is not a ‘sanctuary’ state. That term has no legal definition, and it is not an accurate description of our laws and practices,' Rob Blanchard said. ""Labeling Connecticut a ‘sanctuary’ ignores the reality that our approach mirrors that of many other states that have adopted clear rules for cooperation with federal immigration authorities. As this action proves, nothing in Connecticut law prevented immigration officials from conducting these enforcement efforts, contrary to their own agency’s assertions.”

Connecticut House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora released a statement Wednesday about the ICE sweep:

""I applaud ICE's successful operation targeting and removing criminals from our communities. This enforcement action against individuals who have been involved in serious offenses—including kidnapping, assault, drug crimes, weapons violations, and sex crimes—demonstrates the importance of prioritizing public safety. However, this operation also highlights an outrageous disconnect between federal enforcement priorities and state policies that provide sanctuary for individuals with extensive criminal histories, including members of transnational gangs. Connecticut residents want and deserve leadership that puts their safety first by working cooperatively with federal authorities to ensure that those who pose threats to our communities are captured and removed.""",https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/2025/08/GettyImages-2224826447.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-20 18:56:55.941219

But the state law does not prevent local and state officials from working with ICE to detain people convicted of violent crimes.

Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, a democrat , representing Norwalk, spoke about the incident from the state Capitol in Hartford Wednesday.

“When we see in Norwalk, a man getting tased and hitting his head on pavement with somebody else, and his truck is just left there for his family to retrieve and where he has to be taken to the hospital; that's done by our federal agents,” Duff said.

Duff also defended Democratic State Rep. Corey Paris, of Stamford, who received death threats after warning residents online of ICE activity in his district.

While Duff is the latest state official to criticize ICE apprehensions, local officials including Norwalk Mayor Harry Rilling, say federal deportation efforts can also harm community relationships with city police, especially with immigrants.

Rilling said the lack of transparency from ICE agents makes it difficult for residents to tell who is who, as local police say recent incidents can even dissuade victims from coming forward.

Rilling spoke out Friday after ICE agents twice attempted to enter a police station’s parking lot on August 14.

“We want to first make it clear that Immigration Customs Enforcement were not invited to Norwalk,” Rilling said. “They were not invited to use any facility in the city of Norwalk, including the police department parking lot, which we found rather inappropriate.”

The city issued a statement shortly after where it stated local police were asked to leave the parking lot, agents complied. But they came back the following day, when they were again asked to leave.

Norwalk Police Chief James Walsh said ICE agents’ presence can have a chilling effect on the local community, including undocumented residents.

“What that does is it deters people from coming in there when they see that; we don't want that,” Walsh said.

Mayor Rilling, who is a former Norwalk Police Chief, said the presence of ICE agents, who often wear masks, are in plainclothes and drive unmarked cars, can easily lead to residents mistaking them for local police.

Rilling said that can lead to a breakdown of trust between police and the local community which contradicts ICE’s claims the operation made the state safer.

“When crimes against immigrants go unreported, it can lead to negative consequences, including the perpetuation of criminal activity, a lack of justice for the victims and increased fear within immigrant communities,” Rilling said.

But ICE views its operation as a success ICE launched a four-day operation titled Broken Trust. The statement criticized Connecticut’s Trust Act, the state law limits local and state cooperation with federal deportation efforts, claiming it harms local communities, despite protests from local officials in Norwalk and throughout the state.

“Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut’s Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect. Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde said.

But the state law does not prevent local and state officials from working with ICE to detain people convicted of violent crimes. Out of the at least 65 people ICE claims it arrested, 29 were either charged or convicted previously.

Only 13 of the 29 were publicly identified.

Two of those identified were from Norwalk. One was convicted for sexual assault, threatening and drunk driving. Another resident faced criminal charges for selling cannabis.

ICE did not answer requests for comment from Connecticut Public over concerns by Norwalk officials apprehensions could damage relations between Norwalk residents and police.

Rilling said Norwalk police were not notified by ICE of any upcoming operation.

Undocumented immigrants from Latin America, according to a recent research paper in American Behavioral Scientist, have similar levels of trust and respect for local police as the general population.

That number changes when accounting for age differences. Older undocumented people are more likely to trust and have confidence in local police, especially when comparing them to local police forces in their countries of origin, many of which face long standing criticisms over corruption and human rights abuses.

Before becoming mayor of Norwalk, Rilling served as the city’s police chief in the 1990s, when he heard state law enforcement started anti-drug enforcement operations in the city.

They wore masks, said Rilling, a former criminal justice professor for Norwalk Community College, criticized on transparency grounds.

“I immediately called the state police commander and told them they will not wear masks in the city of Norwalk because they are not identifiable,” Rilling said.

ICE said it also apprehended people who had foreign arrest warrants and Interpol notices, but did not make their identities public. It criticized Connecticut jurisdictions for not honoring immigration detainer requests, blaming them for needing to make arrests within those communities.

Before it closed due to declining prison population, the Prairie Correctional Center was the only privately run prison in Minnesota.
That will continue to be a challenge for attorneys representing immigrants if the former prison becomes an ICE detention center, Decker said.
As an immigrant detention center, the facility would likely hold those seized by ICE in Minnesota, as well as ICE detainees from other states that lack capacity to hold them.","WASHINGTON – With detention beds at full capacity, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is eyeing a long-shuttered prison in Appleton, Minnesota, as part of a massive expansion plan.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Appleton city officials have known that the Prairie Correctional Facility, a 1,600 private prison that has been shuttered since 2010, could be repurposed to hold detained immigrants.

Appleton City Administrator John Olinger said he’d been in talks about the future of the prison with Kelly Durham, managing director at CoreCivic, the company that owns the facility and 38 others across the United States.

Olinger said Durham told him last week that CoreCivic had not yet signed a contract with ICE that involves the Prairie Correctional Facility. But he said she also told him CoreCivic has “aggressively been pursuing something.”

Olinger also said CoreCivic had procured building permits and is in the process of refurbishing the facility.

An ICE takeover of the Prairie Correctional Center could greatly increase the number of immigrants in detention in Minnesota.

Currently, ICE does not run a detention facility in the state but has entered into arrangements with at least four local jails to hold detained migrants, including the ones in Freeborn, Kandiyohi and Sherburne counties.

ICE has plenty of money to expand operations, in Minnesota and across the nation.

The budget reconciliation bill signed into law last month provides $80 billion for internal immigration enforcement, including $45 billion for ICE detention centers and $14.4 billion for ICE transportation and removal operations.

The United States has reached capacity with about 50,000 immigrants under detention. But the Trump administration wants to more than double that number to 107,00, according to a recent story in The Washington Post.

The Post obtained an ICE “road map” that was last updated on July 30. It shows that ICE intends to expand immigrant detention to new parts of the country – including Minnesota and the Appleton facility — nearly doubling its number of large-scale, mega-detention centers and relying increasingly on makeshift “soft-sided” structures that can be built in a few weeks and taken down just as easily.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to requests from MinnPost for information about the plan.

CoreCivic declined to answer questions about its plans for the Prairie Correctional Facility, which at full capacity would have a higher population of inmates than town residents. According to the U.S. Census, Appleton had 1,352 residents last year.

But CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said his company “stays in regular contact with ICE and all of our government partners to understand their changing needs.”

“Concerning our facility in Appleton, we continue to explore opportunities with our government partners for which this site could be a viable solution,” Gustin said.

‘Exciting period’ for private prisons

In a February earnings call, CoreCivic’s then-President and CEO Damon Hininger said his company is proposing to provide ICE with 28,000 detention beds.

He called Trump’s second term “truly one of the most exciting periods” of his career, saying the first bill Congress approved and Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, would greatly boost the fortunes of operators of private prisons.

Named for a University of Georgia nursing student killed by an undocumented immigrant, the law requires ICE to detain immigrants if they’ve been accused of or arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting or assaulting a police officer. That shifted their custody from local jails to the federal system.

Since that earnings call, CoreCivic has entered into new agreements or expanded current agreements with ICE in Tennessee, Texas, Ohio, Oklahoma and Mississippi.

Another large private prison company, the GEO Group, has also benefited from Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Before it closed due to declining prison population, the Prairie Correctional Center was the only privately run prison in Minnesota. It did not seem to have much of a future for many years as states like Minnesota became increasingly wary of placing inmates in those facilities.

Related: Minnesota sheriff’s departments seek to cooperate with ICE

A state law implemented in 2023 bars sheriffs from placing inmates in private prisons.

And former President Joe Biden issued an executive order in his first days in the White House that directed the attorney general not to renew U.S. Justice Department contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities.

But Trump moved quickly after his inauguration to rescind Biden’s executive order. That dramatically changed the fortunes of companies like CoreCivic and the GEO Group and their stocks soared.

Julia Decker, policy director of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there have been discussions over the years about the possible reopening of the Prairie Correctional Center.

“I don’t think it’s a surprise to see it discussed as a possible location to be used by this administration, which has made it clear they want to use as many locations as possible to detain as many people as possible,” Decker said.

A criticism of the Appleton correctional center when it housed inmates for the state is that its location near the South Dakota border was challenging to families and attorneys of the incarcerated to visit. That will continue to be a challenge for attorneys representing immigrants if the former prison becomes an ICE detention center, Decker said.

But immigration lawyers are already facing major obstacles in trying to meet with their detained clients.

After her abrupt exit, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said on the redistricting call that “Collier in the bathroom has more dignity than Donald Trump in the Oval Office.”

“What we just witnessed, them trying to shut her down and say it’s illegal for her to be in the bathroom, and on this call, this is the lengths that they’re going to in Texas to try to bring about a system so unjust and so unjustifiable,” he added.

Martin wrote on X after the incident: “What a disgrace. This is Trump’s America.""

Collier camped out in the statehouse chamber yesterday after she refused a security escort as part of the fallout from Texas Democrats' returning to their home state. The Democratic legislators fled to other states this month to disrupt Texas Republicans’ plans to redraw congressional lines in their favor.

Before she left today's call, Collier said Texas Republicans' proposed maps were ""the most segregated"" seen in the state in decades.

“We’re going to fight as much as we can, whether it’s on the rules or it’s even on the policy. We will continue to push back on the Republican quest to dilute our voice,” she said.

""Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House that is effectively saying: Gerrymander for partisan purposes so we can maintain the House despite our unpopular policies; redistrict right in the middle of a decade between censuses, which is not how the system was designed. I have tremendous respect for how Gov. Newsom has approached this,"" he said.

""So I believe that Gov. Newsom’s approach is a responsible approach. He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximize it. We’re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these maneuvers,"" Obama added.

Reached for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that Trump ""cares deeply about those who feed America — including our soy farmers, who can sell more goods to consumers in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and more"" because of the administration's trade agreements.

""President Trump will continue to open markets and level the playing field for American farmers to ensure they can sell as many made-in-America products as possible,"" she added.

China is by far the top foreign market for U.S. soybeans. Last year, $12.64 billion worth of soybeans were exported there, according to the Department of Agriculture. The European Union was the second biggest importer of U.S. soybeans last year, importing $2.45 billion worth of soybeans, a fraction of China's imports.

Japan imported about $998 million worth of the crop, and the United Kingdom is not one of the top 10 importers, according to the USDA.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250819-donald-trump-vl-429p-3170f3.jpg",N,,2025-08-20 17:56:56.046444

During a District of Columbia court hearing in April, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed the agency’s Student Criminal Alien Initiative.","The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by University of Iowa students who fear they’ve been targeted for deportation.

The federal agency argues that it has complied with court orders in the case by reversing a decision in April to alter the students’ status within the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System — a move that could have paved the way for deportation.

By reversing course, the agency’s lawyers argue, Homeland Security has rendered the lawsuit moot. The plaintiffs, they argue in their motion to dismiss the case, “have obtained the relief they originally sought. There is nothing more for the court to do.”

In their motion, lawyers for Homeland Security acknowledge the judge in the case, when responding to a different motion, had previously ruled that “actions compelled by court order are not actions that moot a case.”

Attorneys for the students have yet to respond to the motion to dismiss. The students’ attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, declined to comment on the matter. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 27.

Judge has rejected prior requests from DHS

In April 2025, the three UI international students and one international-student graduate sued DHS for wrongful termination of their student status, which they alleged caused irreparable stress and anxiety due to fear of imminent seizure and deportation.

On May 15, 2025, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to maintain the plaintiffs’ status as students in its Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records. The judge also ordered DHS to add to the records a notation of active student status that would be backdated to the date the agency had terminated that status — ensuring that other entities wouldn’t act on the termination and attempt to deport the students on that basis.

On June 12, 2025, DHS filed a motion seeking to revise the injunction. The department argued that due to technological limitations with SEVIS records, the system did not allow the creation of written notations that would be visible to other users of the system, such as schools and employers, outside of DHS.

DHS asked that the court issue a ruling indicating it had fulfilled the requirements of the injunction, while also arguing the injunction was overbroad and amounted to a prohibition against any sort of prosecution for crimes the students might commit.

Noting that DHS had made no assertions as to what, if any, efforts had been made to remedy the claimed technological limitations within SEVIS, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied DHS’ motion to revise her order.

With regard to DHS’ claim that the injunction bars future criminal prosecutions, Ebinger noted that her order does not apply to state, county, or local law enforcement acting separately from DHS and not at DHS’ instruction.

Also, she ruled, the injunction “prevents neither arrests nor the commencement of prosecutions. Rather, as to the plaintiffs — four individual people whom the court previously found to be likely to succeed on their claims of unfounded and harmful status record interference — the court’s order requires advance notice to the court as part of defendants’ due process efforts. The order does not prohibit law enforcement actions.”

DHS officials describe Student Criminal Alien Initiative

As part of their recent request for a dismissal of the lawsuit, attorneys for Homeland Security provided the court with a sworn statement from Akil Baldwin, the acting assistant director of the National Security Division of Homeland Security Investigations within the department.

In his statement, Baldwin said he oversees the Student Exchange Visitor Program “in support of ICE efforts to identify, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations.” He said the four UI students’ criminal histories — which, according to the students’ attorney, are limited to misdemeanor-level offenses such as drunken driving — led to the revocation of their student visas.

The process, he said in his statement, began when Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, launched what he called the Student Criminal Alien Initiative.

As part of that initiative, he said, HSI obtained access to the federal criminal database maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine “whether any nonimmigrant students had criminal records.”

HSI then sent its findings to the U.S. Department of State “to take action as it deemed appropriate,” Baldwin said. The Department of State then revoked “some nonimmigrant student visas with an NCIC record,” Baldwin stated.

Then, at the Department of State’s request, HSI terminated the SERVIS records of those students who now had no valid student visa. In April, amid a flurry of litigation related to its actions, Homeland Security reversed course and began restoring the students’ SEVIS records to “active” status.

During a District of Columbia court hearing in April, Homeland Security’s assistant director for national security, Andre Watson, discussed the agency’s Student Criminal Alien Initiative.

Watson testified as to how 10 to 20 ICE employees spent several weeks combing through the records of 1.3 million holders of student visas to determine whether any of them might have had some form of interaction with law enforcement, such as a traffic violation that was later dismissed.

An exasperated D.C. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes asked Watson, “Are you telling me that with all of the cost cutting that we have going on right now — because apparently we’re spending too much money in the federal government doing things like, oh, I don’t know, funding cancer research, can’t afford to do that — that we had, not ‘we,’ but ‘someone,’ had 10 to 20 federal employees spend their time going name by name in a database to see what hits they got for 1.3 million people? Is that what happened? Yes or no.”

“Yes,” Watson replied. He explained that of the 1.3 million student names, less than half of 1%, or roughly 6,400 student names, were passed on to the State Department. The State Department then revoked visas to travel into the United States for 3,000 of those students, and then told Homeland Security to terminate those students’ status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

After hearing from Watson, Judge Reyes cited what she called the federal government’s “utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have (made) communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/U-of-I.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 17:57:29.886222

Ron DeSantis announced last week that state officials are now working on opening a second immigration detention facility that will be called “Deportation Depot” within the Baker Correctional Institution, a temporarily closed state prison in Northeast Florida.
It will hold around 1,300 detainees and is expected to open sometime next month.","South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Oregon U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley have written a letter calling on the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and FEMA to provide detailed information regarding the operation of the Everglades immigration detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”

“Human rights experts have condemned the plan as ‘cruel and inhumane’ by design,” reads the letter, co-signed by more than 60 other Democrats from the House and Senate.

“Construction progressed at ‘turbo speed,’ and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the ‘hottest parts of the state.’”

The lawmakers say they want federal authorities to provide extensive information about the facility by Sept. 3, including:

Identify the legal authority that allows Florida to run the facility;

Confirm that it meets federal standards for the treatment of detainees;

Identify private vendors contracted to operate the facility;

Identify criteria are used to segregate detainees;

Explain what is being done to prevent contamination of drinking water;

Explain any consultation with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes before construction of the facility; and

Tell whether any minors or women have been detained at the facility.

Six of the eight members of the Florida Democratic congressional delegation signed the letter; the only members who did not were South Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz and Central Florida’s Darren Soto.

A federal judge on Monday dismissed part of a lawsuit over the legal rights of detainees at the facility.

U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz in the Southern District of Florida ruled that claims detainees at the facility lack confidential access to immigration court were rendered moot when the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for the cases to be heard.

The court order transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida. The detention site is in Collier County, under the Middle District’s jurisdiction.

Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project, said Wednesday that because of the lawsuit the federal government is now allowing immigrants at Alligator Alcatraz the ability to petition the immigration court for release from detention.

Glad he is off of Washington DC’s streets thanks to President Trump, Secretary Noem, and ICE.” Those charges were dropped by prosecutors, ICE told News4.","Federal agents and D.C. police detained a man along the National Mall as he cried and screamed for help on Wednesday afternoon.

The immigration enforcement action occurred near the Washington Monument and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. It comes as President Donald Trump promises to crack down on crime and illegal immigration in D.C.

News4 was on the Mall to cover another story when we saw law enforcement pull the man over. Officers and agents appeared to make a traffic stop of a man in a blue SUV with an Uber decal. He got out of the car and spoke with law enforcement. After about 12 seconds out of the car, he appears to try to escape. Two members of law enforcement quickly take him to the ground and are joined by four others.

“I don’t owe anything! I don’t owe anything!” he repeatedly yells in Spanish. “Please! I’m not a criminal! I work here! I want to be with my family!”

At one point, six men could be seen kneeling on the ground over the man as he continued to scream. Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Park Police and Metropolitan Police Department insignias can be seen.

Families walk by, a tour bus passes and people film on their phones as members of law enforcement pin the man to the pavement for about 2 minutes.

Dozens of National Guard troops can be seen standing on the side and watching.

The man screams “My family! My family! My family!” over and over again.

About 3 minutes after the man stepped out of the SUV, masked agents put him into an unmarked vehicle.

“My family has papers! My family and my children! Please! Please!” he screams as he is loaded into an SUV, with the museum behind him.

The man, 36-year-old David Perez-Teofani, is from Mexico. He has a final order of removal and has entered the U.S. illegally three times, said an ICE official. He was arrested in Fairfax County Jan. 30, 2024 and was charged with aggravated sexual battery against a minor under 13 and felony indecent liberties. However, ICE told News4 the prosecutors dropped the charges in Aug. 2024.

In a statement to News4, DHS said, “Yes, this illegal alien from Mexico was previously arrested in January 2024 in Fairfax County for aggravated sexual assault of a child under 13. Glad he is off of Washington DC’s streets thanks to President Trump, Secretary Noem, and ICE.”

Those charges were dropped by prosecutors, ICE told News4.

News4 has reached out to the Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney's Office for comment.

D.C. police did not immediately respond to an inquiry. Uber also did not respond to an inquiry.

Perez-Teofani's wife told News4 she found out her husband after a neighbor told her the video of the arrest was circulating on social media.

The detention comes days after Chief of Police Pamela Smith issued an executive order allowing officers making traffic stops to notify ICE about immigrants living in the country without legal status.

The effects of Trump’s Aug. 11 deployment of the National Guard and federalization of D.C. police have rippled through the District for the past week-and-a-half.

A resident who ordered Uber Eats stepped outside to see his delivery driver being detained in the Shaw neighborhood on Saturday.

Among the latest dead are 22 more people killed while seeking food aid. With the latest killings, health officials report the death toll from Israel’s 22-month-long bombardment and siege of Gaza has topped 62,000 — but that number is likely a vast undercount, as more than 11,000 people remain missing and are presumed dead. The U.N. says nearly 19,000 children are among the dead. Meanwhile, Gaza is home to the largest number of child amputees in modern history, with over 4,700 cases of children who’ve lost limbs to Israeli bombs, many of which were supplied by the United States. This is Mohammad Hassan, a boy who lost his leg to an Israeli strike in July that killed his mother and other family members.

Mohammad Hassan: “I was going to buy falafel. When I came back, before reaching home, I looked up and saw the missile falling on us. I tried to run, but it was too fast. I found myself thrown against a wall. And when I looked, my leg was gone. Then someone carried me and brought me to this hospital.”

The United Nations marked World Humanitarian Day on Tuesday by issuing a grim report documenting the killing of 383 aid workers around the world in 2024. That’s a 31% rise from the year before, driven largely by Israeli attacks on Gaza, where 181 humanitarian workers were killed by Israel last year. Meanwhile, 60 humanitarian workers were killed in Sudan as they worked to bring aid to people displaced by civil war. This is U.N. spokesperson Jens Laerke.

Jens Laerke: “This must be a wake-up call to the world. People representing the best of humanity, trying to help others, are being killed in record numbers, and some of them in cold blood.”

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro says his government is deploying 4.5 million soldiers across the country after the United States said it would be shipping more than 4,000 Marines and materiel to the Caribbean region. This comes after the Trump administration secretly signed a directive approving the Pentagon’s use of military force — supposedly to target Latin American drug cartels. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of being the leader of the Cártel de los Soles, offering up to a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest, which critics have slammed as another attempt by the United States to destabilize Venezuela and other countries that oppose U.S. policy.

In California, advocates are demanding the release of a high school student who was taken by federal immigration agents earlier this month while he walked his dog in a Los Angeles neighborhood. The family of Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz described it as a kidnapping, as several plainclothes, masked men wearing tactical vests forced the 18-year-old into an unmarked van. Educators and activists are calling on local officials and schools to protect Guerrero-Cruz and other immigrant students. The teen is being detained at the troubled Adelanto ICE jail, about an hour and a half from his family in L.A.

In more news from California, Customs and Border Protection officers opened fire on a family during an arrest operation in San Bernardino. The family was inside their vehicle on Saturday when armed, masked officers emerged from unmarked cars and surrounded their truck. An undocumented father from Mexico was driving the vehicle; his 18-year-old son and 23-year-old son-in-law, who are U.S. citizens, were in passenger seats. They refused to get out of the vehicle, prompting the officers to smash the windows. Fearing for his life, the driver sped away, with the agent firing his weapon. At least two bullets struck the vehicle. Law enforcement reportedly later arrived at the family’s home, but no arrests were made due to sanctuary policies that prohibit local police from collaborating with federal immigration agencies.

This all comes as The Washington Post reports ICE is planning to double its detention capacity to imprison more than 100,000 immigrants. ICE has already expanded its jails, with plans to open new facilities across the country, including in Nebraska, where a remote prison so-called work camp, dubbed “Cornhusker Clink” by Republicans, will detain hundreds of immigrants awaiting deportation. We’ll have more on ICE’s expanding detention machine later in the broadcast with Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project.

Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., have launched a criminal investigation into President Trump’s claims that police manipulated data to make crime rates appear lower. The probe will be run out of the office of Trump’s hand-picked interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, former Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro. According to The Washington Post, Pirro has instructed prosecutors to maximize criminal charges against anyone arrested during Trump’s federal takeover of Washington, D.C., law enforcement — with the exception of people carrying rifles or shotguns in violation of D.C. laws. In those cases, Pirro said prosecutors should not seek felony charges.

A federal judge has ordered Mississippi to redraw its Supreme Court district lines, after determining they violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock ruled the map — which has remained mostly unchanged for over a century — unlawfully dilutes the power of Black voters.

In Texas, Democratic state Representative Nicole Collier has filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of Republican leaders to put lawmakers under police surveillance. On Monday, Collier was confined to the Texas state Capitol overnight after she refused to be followed by state police monitors assigned to surveil her every move — a requirement for Democrats who had fled Texas over a plan to redraw the state’s congressional district maps to give Republicans five additional seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Collier spent a second night locked in Texas’s state Capitol on Tuesday, joined in solidarity by fellow state representatives.

Meanwhile, in California, Republican lawmakers have filed a lawsuit seeking to block a bid by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw California’s congressional maps to give Democrats five additional House seats. Newsom has said the move is specifically designed to counteract Republican gerrymandering in Texas.

The Justice Department says it has agreed to provide Congress with documents from its investigation into the dead serial sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The House Oversight Committee is set to begin receiving the files on Friday, after it subpoenaed all records and communications from the case files of Epstein and his longtime co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. On Monday, Trump’s former Attorney General Bill Barr gave a deposition to the Oversight Committee about Jeffrey Epstein after he, too, was subpoenaed. The committee, however, has not issued a subpoena to Alex Acosta, President Trump’s former labor secretary, who, as a U.S. attorney in Florida in 2008, approved a nonprosecution agreement that shut down the federal probe into Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and allowed Epstein to serve little time in prison.

Meanwhile, in a highly unusual move, the Trump administration announced this week it had tapped Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to be co-deputy director of the FBI. He’ll serve alongside Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and right-wing podcaster whom Trump previously tapped as the FBI’s second-in-command. Bailey’s appointment comes after Bongino publicly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi and threatened to resign over the Trump administration’s refusal to release the Epstein files.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center at Fort Bliss in El Paso, which opened this past weekend, will be able to hold as many as 5,000 detainees upon its completion in the coming months, making it the largest federal detention center in U.S. history.
Japanese American advocates, however, say that the facility, which once imprisoned people considered “enemy aliens,” is a chilling reminder of a dark past.
“The use of national security rhetoric to justify mass incarceration today echoes the same logic that led to their forced removal and incarceration,” said Ann Burroughs, president and CEO of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.
“Many in the Japanese American community … encourage the administration to not brush aside civil rights because of racism, rumors, hysteria and propaganda,” Tomine said.","Japanese American groups criticized the construction of a new immigrant detention center in Texas at a military base that was used during World War II to imprison people of Japanese descent.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center at Fort Bliss in El Paso, which opened this past weekend, will be able to hold as many as 5,000 detainees upon its completion in the coming months, making it the largest federal detention center in U.S. history. Japanese American advocates, however, say that the facility, which once imprisoned people considered “enemy aliens,” is a chilling reminder of a dark past.

“The use of national security rhetoric to justify mass incarceration today echoes the same logic that led to their forced removal and incarceration,” said Ann Burroughs, president and CEO of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.

“It is inconceivable that the United States is once again building concentration camps, denying the lessons learned 80 years ago.”

The Trump administration hit back at the comparisons made between the use of the base during World War II and the current immigration climate, including those from the American Civil Liberties Union, which described the facility as “another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history.”

“Comparisons of illegal alien detention centers to internment camps used during World War II are deranged and lazy,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “The facts are ICE is targeting the worst of the worst—including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, and rapists.”

The sprawling detention center, which cost roughly $1.2 billion to build, currently has the capacity to hold an estimated 1,000 people. More than 80 years ago, the base was an official U.S. Army facility that was used as a temporary internment camp, holding nationals from Japan, Germany and Italy, said Derrek Tomine, president of the National Japanese American Historical Society.

The square facility contained two compounds, surrounded by barbed wire fences, Tomine said. Armed guard towers sat at the corners. Many of the individuals of Japanese descent, in addition to other immigrants who were detained there, were awaiting their hearing before an enemy alien hearing board, Tomine explained.

“Generally those held at the U.S. Army facilities were first-generation Japanese Americans detained early in World War II and who were then processed and shipped to other internment camps,” Tomine said.

Both Tomine and Burroughs said that the comparisons between the immigrant detention facility of the present and the internment camp of the past are “neither deranged nor lazy.”

“Entire communities, over 125,000 Japanese Americans, were forcibly removed from the West Coast in 1942 and today our immigrant brothers and sisters face the terror of ICE and CBP raids across the country,” Burroughs said. “It was a miscarriage of justice then, and it is a miscarriage of justice now.”

Tomine said he thinks the way that immigrants are being blamed for taking jobs, abusing government services and being the source of a host of societal issues smacks of the scapegoating of marginalized communities in the past, including during World War II.

“Many of these same immigrants fled their home countries to avoid being taken away and placed into camps without charges or due process,” Tomine said of the recent detentions.

Though the administration said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been prioritizing the targeting of criminals, roughly 70% of the estimated 59,380 individuals held in ICE detention as of Aug. 10 have no criminal conviction, according to data collected by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an independent, nonpartisan data research organization. Texas, where Fort Bliss is located, is the state that has housed the most people during fiscal year 2025.

Fort Bliss has been the center of widespread criticism, particularly in the local El Paso community. McLaughlin previously said in a statement that the facility will offer legal representation, a law library, access to visitation, medical treatment and recreational space. However, Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, who toured the facility Monday, criticized the massive amount of funding approved for the site, in addition to major concerns over the conditions in the center, which is being run by private contractors.

“I think it’s far too easy for standards to slip when there are private facilities,” Escobar said during a news conference Monday. “I think private facilities far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Many, including the ACLU, also brought up the facility’s past as an intake shelter that housed almost 5,000 migrant children at its peak. Audio from 2021 revealed allegations of sexual misconduct by staff toward minors, in addition to a lack of clean clothing and other concerns.

Tomine said the hasty opening of the detention center at Fort Bliss and others across the country are proof that perhaps the U.S. has failed to learn lessons from the treatment of immigrants and Japanese Americans during World War II.

“Many in the Japanese American community … encourage the administration to not brush aside civil rights because of racism, rumors, hysteria and propaganda,” Tomine said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250820-fort-bliss-detention-center-mn-1015-13d3dc.jpg",N,,2025-08-20 17:57:15.482895

“Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health, and violate federal law,” according to the letter signed by 65 Democratic members of Congress.

The letter comes after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tuesday announced a partnership with the state of Nebraska to open a 300-bed federal immigration detention center for its version of “Alligator Alcatraz,” dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Another facility in Bunker Hill, Indiana, nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer,” is being constructed to hold 1,000 immigrants.

Lawsuits in Florida

As the Trump administration aims to carry out its plans of mass deportations, partnerships with states to detain immigrants for removal are key but are also provoking opposition.

The facility in the Everglades, where state and federal officials aim to detain up to 5,000 immigrants, is currently facing a legal challenge in federal court from immigration advocates over allegations of limited access to attorneys for detainees.

There is also a second lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe to pause construction of the site, arguing it violates federal environmental laws.

“Experts worry this novel state-run immigration detention model will allow Florida to create an ‘independent, unaccountable detention system’ that runs parallel to the federal detention system,” according to the letter.

Other states following Florida's lead?

Democrats also expressed concern that the facility in the Everglades would serve as a model for other states.

“Beyond human rights and due process issues, this plan raises serious environmental concerns,” according to the letter.

In the letter, Democrats are asking for information about the legal authority for the state of Florida to construct and operate a migrant detention facility; the agreement between the state and DHS related to the operation of the facility; and measures that are being taken to ensure clean water, food, temperature regulation and medical care are provided for detainees, among other things.

“Human rights experts have condemned the plan as ‘cruel and inhumane’ by design,” according to the letter. “Construction progressed at ‘turbo speed,’ and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the ‘hottest parts of the state.’”

Democrats are also seeking inspection reports, environmental review documents and contracts of private vendors that are operating the facility.

The letter asks for a response by Sept. 3.

August 20, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Attorney General Ellison today announced he joined a coalition of 21 attorneys general in suing the Trump Administration over the illegal imposition of conditions on Congressionally-authorized Victims of Crime Act grants. The Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, has declared that States will be unable to access these funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they agree to support the Trump Administration’s extreme immigration enforcement efforts.

“Pulling the rug out from under crime victims is exactly the kind of cruelty I have come to expect from Donald Trump and his administration,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison. “Crime victims deserve so much better than to be used as political leverage, so I am filing a lawsuit to put an end to that and make sure victims get the support and compensation they deserve. My mission is to help Minnesotans afford their lives and live with dignity, safety, and respect, and if Donald Trump violates the law and interferes with that mission, I will not hesitate to take him to court.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable States to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives: victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, , and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that States could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to States based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ), has declared that States, along with the victims and survivors they serve, will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. In order to receive these funds, States must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal, not state government responsibility.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers, and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce States to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Ellison and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

In a ruling issued on August 19, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois rejected the administration's arguments, finding that the Illinois Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act is not preempted by federal immigration law.

Why It Matters

The ruling matters because it draws a clearer boundary between federal immigration power and state authority over workplace regulation. By rejecting the Trump administration's effort to use immigration law to override Illinois' privacy protections, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman reaffirmed that states retain broad authority to govern employment relationships.

The decision safeguards workers' procedural rights in the hiring process, could set a precedent for other states considering similar measures, and marks a significant check on the expansion of federal enforcement authority.

What To Know

The case centered on whether federal law—particularly the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)—supersedes state-level employment protections. The administration argued that provisions of Illinois' law regulating the use of the federal E-Verify system and protecting employees during the employment verification process interfered with federal immigration authority.

Coleman disagreed, concluding that the state law ""is not expressly preempted by IRCA and does not intrude upon the federal government's constitutional powers in the space of immigration and foreign affairs."" She added that the government's ""broad interpretation of its power to regulate matters of immigration would swallow the historic powers of the states over employment-related issues"".

The Federal Government's Argument

The Trump administration claimed that several provisions of Illinois' privacy law—including penalties for violations related to E-Verify—constituted sanctions on employers of unauthorized workers and therefore fell under IRCA's preemption clause. That provision bars states from imposing civil or criminal sanctions on employers who hire or recruit unauthorized workers/aliens.

The Justice Department also argued that Illinois' law, by imposing notification requirements and other conditions on the use of E-Verify, conflicted with the federal goal of deterring unauthorized employment.

At oral argument, however, Coleman noted that government lawyers struggled to identify precisely which sections of Illinois law they believed were preempted. In her ruling, she wrote that the administration's interpretation of IRCA's preemption clause was ""broad to the point of absurdity.""

Judge's Reasoning

Coleman emphasized that employment regulation has historically been a power of the states. ""States possess broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the State,"" she wrote, citing Supreme Court precedent.

The judge found that Illinois' law does not penalize employers for hiring unauthorized workers but rather regulates how employers use verification systems and ensures employees' rights are respected during that process. ""A person's immigration or work authorization status is irrelevant to determine whether an employer has violated any of the provisions of the act,"" Coleman explained.

She further rejected the administration's conflict preemption argument, which claimed that Illinois' law undermined federal objectives. The government suggested that the state's notification rules could encourage unauthorized workers to evade detection. Coleman dismissed this as ""simply too speculative a basis on which to rest a finding of pre-emption.""

Broader Implications

The ruling represents a significant legal setback for Trump's immigration agenda, which has frequently sought to expand federal authority over state and local policies. By upholding Illinois' privacy protections, the court reaffirmed the principle that federal power over immigration does not automatically override state employment laws.

The decision may carry consequences beyond Illinois. Other states have enacted or considered similar laws governing the use of E-Verify and employee privacy. Coleman's opinion suggests that such measures, when designed to regulate employment rather than immigration status, may withstand federal challenges.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Justice for comment via email outside of regular working hours on Wednesday.

What People Are Saying

Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman wrote in her ruling that Illinois' workplace privacy law ""is not expressly preempted by IRCA and does not intrude upon the federal government's constitutional powers in the space of immigration and foreign affairs."" She added that the administration's interpretation of federal law was, ""broad to the point of absurdity.""

Kyle Cheney of Politico wrote on X, August 20, 2025, ""A federal judge in Illinois has thrown out the Trump administration's lawsuit against the state that claims IL's workforce privacy law conflicts with federal immigration enforcement.""

In a broader context, legal scholars and state officials have long debated the limits of federal power in immigration enforcement.

Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University, told the Washington Post in 2017: ""Trump and future presidents could use [the executive order] to seriously undermine constitutional federalism by forcing dissenting cities and states to obey presidential dictates, even without authorization from Congress. The circumvention of Congress makes the order a threat to separation of powers, as well.""

What Happens Next

The Trump administration is expected to appeal to the Seventh Circuit, with a possible path to the Supreme Court. For now, Illinois' workplace privacy law remains in effect, and the ruling could inspire other states to adopt similar protections while intensifying debates over federal versus state authority.

Yet the “medical purpose” that triggers the ban can only be determined by looking at the patient’s sex and gender identity.
Equal protection law has long recognized that even laws written or framed in neutral terms may still have discriminatory effects, under disparate impact analysis.","This decision is a concerning narrowing of equal protection doctrine and a departure from the US’ obligations under international human rights law, including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). According to the UN Human Rights Committee, in charge of monitoring implementation of the ICCPR, States are obligated under the ICCPR to ensure that LGBTQ+ people are entitled to equal protection of and equality under the law, which includes access to gender-affirming care.

By failing to recognize how laws like Tennessee’s operate on the basis of gender identity and sex, the Court has opened the door to further restrictions on gender-affirming care, potential reshaping of how discrimination is defined and applied under the law, and noncompliance with global human rights standards designed to guard against unequal treatment.

Banning gender affirming care violates international human rights law

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 25 US states, including Tennessee, have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, including hormone therapy and puberty-suppressant medications, impacting more than 100,000 transgender minors. These bans still allow youth to access similar medical treatments for medical conditions other than gender dysphoria. A proposed federal bill would extend such restrictions nationwide.

These bans violate international human rights law and standards and contradict the overwhelming medical consensus that gender-affirming care is often life-saving. The UN Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (UN SOGI) has made clear that denying access to gender-affirming care amounts to discrimination and violates the right to the highest attainable standard of health.

In upholding Tennessee’s law, which explicitly states that its purpose is to “encourage minors to appreciate their sex” – a value-laden judgement about identity rather than medical care – the Court has validated discriminatory practices, infringed on the rights of transgender youth, and fallen short of its obligations under international human rights law.

SB1 denies care explicitly on the basis of sex assigned at birth

Tennessee’s statute, SB1, prohibits medical treatments that “enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex.” It delineates between treatments that affirm a child’s sex assigned at birth and those that do not. The law allows physicians to, for example, prescribe testosterone to a cisgender boy experiencing delayed puberty, but not to a transgender boy experiencing gender dysphoria.

In other words, the statute permits the same medications when used to affirm sex assigned at birth, but prohibits them when used to support a gender identity inconsistent with it. In effect, the law functions precisely as a result of a sex-based determination, even if disguised under medical terminology.

The determining factor is not the treatment itself, but whether it aligns with the sex assigned at birth of the person seeking it.

Yet, in Skrmetti, the Court declines to call this delineation sex-based. It instead accepts the state’s assertion that the law is concerned with the purpose of the treatment, not who is receiving it. But when the treatment’s permissibility depends on the patient’s sex, that is a sex-based regulation. And, under longstanding equal protection doctrine, such laws ought to be afforded heightened judicial scrutiny, an approach that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), when fully recognized, would strengthen by requiring judicial actors to assess cases under the highest level of judicial scrutiny.

The Court’s “medical purpose” rationale masks reality: the law defines treatment eligibility by sex

The Court characterizes SB1 as regulating a class of medical interventions, not the identity of the patient. Yet the “medical purpose” that triggers the ban can only be determined by looking at the patient’s sex and gender identity. In reality, this determination, framed as a regulation of procedures, is a regulation of who may access those procedures, and that access is based on sex.

Equal protection law has long recognized that even laws written or framed in neutral terms may still have discriminatory effects, under disparate impact analysis. In this case, the law permits or denies treatment not based on medical risk, efficacy, or clinical guidance, but on whether treatment coincides with ideological views about sex and gender identity.

A more rigorous equal protection analysis, which should apply to sex-based classifications, would have required the Court to examine whether the state’s reasoning truly justifies restricting access to care. In the absence of a clear constitutional standard, which the ERA would provide, courts may continue to afford broad discretion to legislative reasoning.

Invoking Bostock while undermining it: the Court’s contradictory approach

The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Skrmetti departs from the clear logic it applied in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), where it held that discrimination against transgender individuals on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination. That decision marked a major step forward for LGBTQI+ rights, one that ought to have been central to the Court’s reasoning in Skrmetti.

The Court in Skrmetti initially states that it declines to decide whether its reasoning extends past Title VII. However, it then attempts to differentiate this case from Bostock, asserting that a transgender boy would be denied treatment regardless of his sex assigned at birth, so long as the diagnosis is gender dysphoria.

This interpretation relies on a narrow reading of the law that ignores how it works in practice.

A major step backward from modern interpretations of equal protection

To support its conclusion, the Court relies on Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), a case that upheld the exclusion of pregnancy-related disabilities from insurance coverage. The Geduldig decision reasoned that, because pregnancy is a physical condition and not experienced by all women, the policy did not classify on the basis of sex. That case has long been criticized for its failure to acknowledge that distinctions targeting conditions unique to one sex, like pregnancy, can still constitute sex-based discrimination.

In Skrmetti, the Court adopts a similar rationale. Because the law applies to all minors who seek gender affirming care, regardless of their sex assigned at birth, the Court reasons it is not discriminatory. But this fails to consider that only transgender minors seek such care, and only they are subject to the ban.

By reviving the flawed reasoning of Geduldig, the Court enables laws that functionally exclude specific groups to escape heightened constitutional review, so long as the language is carefully crafted. But equal protection demands more than clever wording; it requires an honest look at how laws actually impact people. And that’s exactly what the majority in Skrmetti failed to do.

A warning sign for the future of sex equality

The Skrmetti decision reflects a broader shift in equal protection doctrine away from substantive analysis of how laws operate and toward deference to legislative framing. Although SB1 is clearly conditioned on sex and its purpose is ideologically motivated, the Court, in contradiction to human rights law and standards, declines to treat it as a sex-based classification.

This approach risks rendering the Equal Protection Clause ineffective in precisely the kinds of cases where its protections are most needed, where marginalized groups face targeted state action under the guise of neutrality.

This ruling is a warning sign. It shows how easily discrimination can be disguised in facially neutral language, while in reality targeting specific groups. Without clear and enforceable constitutional protections, such as those the ERA would provide, laws that restrict access to care or other rights based on sex or gender identity can slip through the cracks.

The path forward requires perseverance and vigilance, not only in advocating for stronger legal standards, but in ensuring judges at least uphold existing standards in practice and look to the standards set by international human rights mechanisms. Skrmetti makes clear that relying on outdated legal reasoning leaves too many vulnerable, and that’s a reality we cannot accept. Universal recognition and application of the ERA would go a long way to addressing these challenges.

The Supreme Court Ruling in the Skrmetti Case Should Have Taken Sex Discrimination Into Account: 5 Things To Know was originally published on Equality Now.

Their extra-legal status is a problem because: They have no rights and are thus subject to abuse. They are not entitled to federal benefits, so their welfare and that of their communities are impacted. They are part of a huge black market of labor that the government cannot regulate. Bottom line, you have 11 million people living here who are not integrated into the larger society.

Contrary to Trump, the problem is not that they are criminals, take jobs away from Americans, and use up resources; those are all lies, fabrications. Undocumented immigrants are no more likely to be criminals than the rest of the population. They are mostly hard-working, tax-paying people with families, trying to eke out an existence in a new country. They don't take away jobs from Americans because American workers don't want the jobs immigrants take. And as a general matter, they are not eligible for federal benefits. The one exception is that they are entitled to access public education.

Those are the facts. But before talking about an answer to the immigration problem, we need to talk about the reasons for having a particular immigration policy to begin with.

Immigrants were welcomed by our country in the 19th century because, first, they supplied people to populate the vast new areas that had been added to our country, and later, they supplied the vast unskilled labor pool that our expanding country and industry desperately needed. America would not have been able to become the economic powerhouse it is without these immigrants.

Where do things stand today? As seen by the reaction of agriculture, meatpackers, and various other businesses, undocumented immigrants are critical to their ability to grow and process the produce and meat needed by our country to feed itself. These are jobs that pay so poorly, with working conditions that are so bad, that Americans have no interest in applying for these positions. Without the flow of undocumented immigrants, this part of our economy would grind to a halt. That would not be in the national interest.

So the question is, why don't we increase our legal immigration quotas to allow the influx of workers this country desperately needs? Why do we not provide a path to citizenship for those who are already here, working and paying taxes?

The answer is xenophobia and bigotry. There are many Americans, not just White supremacists, who don't like the fact that white people will soon no longer be the majority race in the U.S., largely because of the huge influx of Hispanics over the past few decades.

Democrats are viewed as being weak on immigration. Republicans hold up the picture that all but one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates responded in a debate that they favored decriminalizing illegal entry into the U.S. But it wasn't always so. It was under President Clinton that the immigration enforcement system that we know today was created.

Obama tried to answer the challenge of undocumented immigrants with a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill that included a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented individuals. It passed the Senate with substantial Republican support because of the hard line it took on border security. But the Republican-controlled House didn't even take up consideration of the bill. A possible explanation: This xenophobic attitude is especially prevalent in rural areas, and in rural areas lies the strength of the Republican Party.

In the years since then, Trump has done a great disservice to this country by painting a false picture of undocumented immigrants as criminal scum. Because this picture has been embraced as fact by his supporters, it will make it that much harder to pass the legislation necessary to integrate these immigrants into our nation and legally provide agriculture and other industries with the flow of unskilled labor they need to function.

So what's the political and humane solution to the immigration problem? The answer is again a package combining strict border security with immigration reform.

All illegal immigration must be stopped at the border through strict enforcement of our laws.

Undocumented immigrants who are currently in the U.S., working and paying taxes, and who have not been convicted of crimes, should be given a path to citizenship with their families (children and parents) who are already here.

Those undocumented immigrants under 60 who are already here and who do not choose to take advantage of the path to citizenship should be subject to deportation, humanely, back to their country of origin.

The legal immigration quota from Mexico, Central America, and other relevant countries should be increased substantially to allow for the labor needed by American businesses.

A major education program should be undertaken by the federal government to correct the damage done by Trump to the reputation of undocumented immigrants in the minds of many Americans.

The federal government should institute ESL (English as a Second Language) courses for all immigrants.

Some minimum level of mastery of the English language should be required for renewal of a Green Card or other legal status for all immigrants under 60 after they have been here for two years. (Such a requirement already exists for citizenship.)

The last points may be controversial because many people, mostly Democrats and people of color, are against the idea of making English the country's official language and thus would likely be against mandatory English training as well as the language requirement for Green Card renewal.

But if the idea of immigration is to integrate immigrants into the flow of the American economy and society within a reasonable period of time, then a minimum mastery of English should be required, not just for citizenship but for Green Card holders (permanent residents) as well. The idea is not to disrespect the immigrants' culture but to ensure that immigrants are also able to partake in American culture and be part of our society. I am in fact in favor of vibrant ethnic and racial subcultures coexisting with American culture (see my blogpost ""Pluralism or DEI?"").

We are a nation of immigrants. But it's important to realize that this fact was not the result of some do-gooder, humanitarian policy, as exemplified in Emma Lazarus' famous poem that is enshrined at the Statue of Liberty. It was instead the result of the government's acknowledgement of an economic reality—that a major influx of people was needed to grow our country and prosper. This has been the basis of the government's immigration policy through much of our history, despite the xenophobic reaction of much of the population—even of immigrants once they became established—to new waves of immigrants.

The government must again react with good policy in the face of popular xenophobia.

Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) filed after she took to the House floor to accuse a man of being a predator.

Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) filed after she took to the House floor to accuse a man of being a predator.

U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel ruled that, federal law entitles the Justice Department to step in and largely make Mace immune from damages and proceeded to dismiss the case in its entirety.

Gergel did not address whether Mace actually defamed the man, Brian Musgrave, and acknowledged the ruling means he may have no ability to recover damages even if she falsely destroyed his reputation, as Musgrave claims.

“Congress has weighed the risks and benefits …. and concluded that libel and related claims against federal officials acting within the scope of their employment are barred under federal law. It is this Court’s duty to uphold the rule of law,” the judge wrote.

Gergel was nominated to the bench by former President Obama.

Musgrave sued Mace in March after she gave a stunning speech on the House floor that included a series of allegations of sexual abuse and voyeurism.

Mace, who is now running for governor of South Carolina, celebrated the ruling.

“Today the court proved the US Constitution is the LAW OF THE LAND,” Mace said in a statement. “They came after me because I stood up for victims and demanded crime be prosecuted. Today’s court decision proves their lies and attacks won’t break me. I’ve put my career on the line to fight crime and drafted legislation to strengthen our laws. And I’ll never stop fighting for law and order.”

Musgrave was one of four men whom Mace singled out in a stunning speech on the House floor in February, in which she lobbed accusations of sexual abuse and voyeurism. In addition to Musgrave, Mace accused her ex-fiancé and two other men of wrongdoing.

Eric Bland, Musgrave’s attorney, said the decision allows politicians to “say and do anything they want” but vowed to “keep fighting” to clear his client’s name.

“It seems patently unfair that a United States citizen who lives a law-abiding life can be grouped and called a rapist and a predator without any proof, and it can be done over and over again with immunity (and impunity),” Bland said in a statement.

Mace in the speech claimed to have found a hidden camera on a property Musgrave owns with Mace’s ex-fiancé that had intimate photos of women taken without their knowledge or consent. Musgrave’s suit said he didn’t place the camera and never had knowledge of it.

While he was not the subject of Mace’s more serious allegations in the speech, such as her belief she was raped after being “purposefully incapacitated,” Mace labeled Musgrave along with the three other men as a “predator.”

The lawsuit took aim at the speech, Mace’s social media posts and a poster displayed outside her congressional office titled “PREDATORS” with images of the four men. The case also included claims against some of Mace’s congressional staff.

Last month, the Justice Department sought to step in and largely replace Mace and the staffers as the defendant by certifying they were acting in the scope of their jobs, making them immune and leaving taxpayers on the hook for damages.

Gergel, the judge, agreed that the government could do so on all but one claim: that Mace owes Musgrave damages for violating his constitutional rights, known as a Bivens action.

But the judge went on to dismiss that claim, too, finding it isn’t permitted in defamation cases and that Mace was protected anyway by the U.S. Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause.

Mace has made her accusations against the men a central part of her political identity in recent months.

Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized,” Hyde told Fox News.

“As [Operation Broken Trust] proves, nothing in Connecticut law prevented immigration officials from conducting these enforcement efforts, contrary to their own agency’s assertions,” Blanchard said.
Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, called the ICE operation “excellent news.” “Connecticut’s streets are now safer.","Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s New England Office announced Wednesday that they had arrested 65 immigrants in Connecticut in a four-day operation dubbed “Operation Broken Trust.”

The announcement comes after advocates in multiple cities in Western Connecticut alerted residents and organized protests about increased federal immigration enforcement activity last week.

Last Thursday, immigration advocates held a rally in Stamford to protest recent ICE activity in the city. Two men were reportedly arrested at the Stamford Superior Courthouse on Aug. 11. According to reporting by CT Public, the two men were there for a follow-up appointment after being the victims of an armed robbery.

The group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants said in a Thursday release that federal agents have been seen at the courthouse on a regular basis. The group says that on Aug. 12, six people were arrested on their way to work, and an additional four were arrested on Aug. 13. On Aug. 14, two people were allegedly arrested at Danbury Superior Court.

Videos posted on social media show confrontations between advocacy groups and ICE agents in the parking lot of Danbury Superior Court, as the officials arrest a man and a woman. The videos show a group of officers dressed in tactical gear, some of whom wore masks.

According to ICE, 29 of the 65 people arrested had been either charged with or convicted of “serious crimes.” Of the 13 people named in the release, five were arrested in Stamford, two in Norwalk, and six in Danbury. Some of the 13 people identified in the release had been convicted of crimes, including drug possession, sexual assault, DUI and larceny, according to ICE. Others were facing charges, including assault, breach of peace, and carrying a dangerous weapon.

It isn’t clear from the release how many of the 65 people arrested had been convicted of crimes.

In Norwalk, ICE officers sat in the parking lot of the police department on Thursday and Friday. Mayor Harry Rilling and Police Chief James Walsh put out a statement on Friday saying that ICE had not been authorized to sit in the parking lot and that they were asked to leave on both days. Rilling said during a press conference on Friday that the police department was not working with ICE.

Walsh said that he and Rilling had a long conversation with federal authorities to “voice their displeasure” about ICE officers’ using the parking lot. Walsh told The Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday that he did not know of any additional ICE activity this week.

Police in Danbury, Norwalk and Stamford all told CT Mirror that they were not aware of “Operation Broken Trust” and that they did not know the number of people who were arrested or detained by ICE.

A video posted to social media showed two brothers, Ricardo and Leonard Chavez, tased and arrested by ICE agents in Norwalk in the middle of the street. Walsh said at the press conference that police had removed a vehicle with smashed windows from Main Street.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde criticized Connecticut’s Trust Act, which prohibits local and state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, unless the person has been convicted of certain serious crimes, is on the federal terrorist list or is the subject of a judicial warrant.

“Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut’s Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect. Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized,” Hyde told Fox News.

This year, the Trust Act was modified to allow individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law but also expanded the situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers — and not be subject to such litigation. Sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation, burglary with a firearm, possessing child sexual abuse material, enticing or sexually exploiting a minor and violating a protective order are now crimes that allow Connecticut law enforcement to hand someone over to ICE.

On Aug. 13, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont in which she said that Connecticut had been placed on a list of jurisdictions that “engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States.”

She asked Lamont to confirm “your commitment to complying with federal law and identif[y] the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.”

Lamont wrote back that Connecticut law does not stop federal immigration enforcement from carrying out operations. He also criticized the federal government for practices like arresting people at courthouses, which he said make it more difficult for law enforcement officers to do their jobs.

“We all agree that violent criminals should be arrested, prosecuted, and, when appropriate, deported, which is why Connecticut law facilitates law enforcement working with federal officers in those instances. Unfortunately, DHS’s current deportation tactics undermine legitimate law enforcement by instilling fear among residents and interfering in the orderly functioning of our state courts,” the letter reads.

In a statement to CT Mirror, Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont, underscored that Connecticut is not a “sanctuary” state — a term that he said has no legal definition.

“As [Operation Broken Trust] proves, nothing in Connecticut law prevented immigration officials from conducting these enforcement efforts, contrary to their own agency’s assertions,” Blanchard said.

Sen. Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, called the ICE operation “excellent news.”

“Connecticut’s streets are now safer. Violent offenders are now in custody. The federal government clearly has taken note of Connecticut’s super-sanctuary policies, even though Gov. Lamont and Democrats really, really don’t want the term ‘sanctuary state’ applied to our state,” they said in a statement.

Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, the House Minority Leader, also praised ICE for its “successful operation targeting and removing criminals from our communities” while criticizing Connecticut’s policies, which he said “provide sanctuary for individuals with extensive criminal histories, including members of transnational gangs.”

“Connecticut residents want and deserve leadership that puts their safety first by working cooperatively with federal authorities to ensure that those who pose threats to our communities are captured and removed,” he said in a statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0820_SR_FairfieldCourthouse_008.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 18:57:00.714228

The fundamentals of the migrant crisis, then, have not been resolved by the closure of the Bell Hotel.
Illegal migrants will still come to Britain, and they will still be housed.
A government that really wanted to stop illegal migration would consider more stringent measures, such as automatic deportation of illegal immigrants or those with criminal convictions languishing in our prisons.
Of course illegal immigrants are seeking a better life.","After yesterday’s landmark decision on the Bell Hotel in Epping, the next question must be: where do we go from here?

What is essential to understand is that yesterday’s High Court judgement was what might be called an ‘Al Capone reckoning’. One ultimate actor, the state, and by extension the government, has been humbled on a mere technicality. The Essex hotel was deemed in breach of contract for using its rooms to accommodate refugees, rather than paying guests. The state was not brought to heel on its ethically unsound and socially corrosive laws on immigration and re-settlement.

That the Home Office sought to block Epping Forest council’s application for an injunction is important. Campaigners and the public will still face an elite establishment – especially, despite yesterday’s judgement, a judiciary – that has an intransigent and indulgent attitude to migrants, and a slavish, literal-minded adherence to human rights laws.

The fundamentals of the migrant crisis, then, have not been resolved by the closure of the Bell Hotel. They will not be resolved by the closure of other hotels, either. Illegal migrants will still come to Britain, and they will still be housed. This crisis will end in the same way it was always going to: with changes in policy and attitudes.

We have already witnessed the effectiveness of one stern response. That was the Rwanda scheme. Although the plan for its establishment was fraught with difficulties, when it did briefly come into law last April many illegal immigrants responded by taking flight to the Republic of Ireland, as complaints by the Dublin government at the time attested. This principle of deterrence must be re-visited. Keir Starmer’s plan to ‘smash the gangs’ has not worked.

A government that really wanted to stop illegal migration would consider more stringent measures, such as automatic deportation of illegal immigrants or those with criminal convictions languishing in our prisons. These policies would prove popular, but Starmer isn’t going to enact them. One might imagine that only a Reform government would.

The ultimate ‘uncompassionate’ policy is the unsayable one: stop picking up migrants from their boats in the first place. Return them to France, with or without the French government’s cooperation. This would most likely contravene maritime law and cause legal challenges and a diplomatic fallout with our neighbours.

Lurking behind so many of these preventative measures are not legal or political obstacles, but rather intangible ones, those which can’t be revoked or reversed by diktat, legislation, court ruling or vote.

In order for matters to change for good, attitudes need to change and lazy assumptions need to be dismantled. The first is the one parroted by those with no imagination, no will or just no wish: this is that there is ‘no solution’ to this fundamentally global problem. There is, as outlined above. It just takes determination and the willingness to risk the opprobrium of bien-pensants. Passive and defeatist mantras should have no place anywhere in political discourse.

The second is to confront the idle axiom that British people today increasingly hate foreigners. This is mostly untrue. Rather, many are angry at the increasing number of immigrants and their decreasing quality. If there is ire directed against one group of people, it is the liberal elite and those who have favoured cheap labour in their factories and homes. It is imperative that the thought-terminating accusation of ‘xenophobia’ is ignored or rebutted.

A third shibboleth contains other weedy platitudes: that migrants who force their way onto our shores are ‘fleeing persecution’ and ‘are only seeking a better life’. That first bromide is refutable. Those who come by boat are arriving from France, a democracy where no-one is persecuted by the state for their beliefs or ethnicity. The second statement represents a worrying detachment from reality. Of course illegal immigrants are seeking a better life. We all want a better life.

The ultimate mindset which demands the most patience and perseverance in overturning is the embedded belief and unspoken truism that ‘compassion’ is inherently good. Sometimes it manifestly isn’t. Sometimes, voicing compassionate sentiment only improves the feeling of well-being among those who voice it. Immigration policies based on compassion have so far only served to increase feelings of resentment and anger among the native population.

Yesterday’s judgement about the Bell Hotel matters, but real change will only come when we upend the conceit that compassionate beliefs or saying nice things necessarily correlate with or result in positive outcomes. Only an unfashionable attitude and ‘uncaring’ policies will solve the migrant crisis.",https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2227035646.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 15:56:36.402203

The policy also risks denying benefits to those who support boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaigns as a lawful, nonviolent means of advancing Palestinian rights.
“We are demanding that USCIS rescind this policy immediately.
Congress must also conduct oversight to ensure that immigration adjudications are not politicized or manipulated to shield Israel from accountability.” CAIR is urging: USCIS to rescind Policy Alert PA-2025-16.
The administration to guarantee that opposition to genocide, apartheid, and land theft is never grounds for denying immigration benefits.","The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today demanded that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) immediately rescind a new policy that threatens both immigration benefits and the First Amendment rights of immigrant communities, particularly those advocating for Palestinian human rights.

On August 19, USCIS released Policy Alert PA-2025-16, instructing officers to treat as an “overwhelmingly negative” factor any applicant alleged to have “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” the views of so-called “anti-American ideologies” or groups, including those labeled as tied to “antisemitic terrorism.” The guidance applies immediately to a wide range of benefits, including adjustment of status, extensions and changes of status, employment authorization, student reinstatement, national interest waivers, and EB-5 petitions.

CAIR warns that these vague, politically charged, and Israel-First standards will be weaponized to punish Palestinians, Muslims, Arabs, and their allies for engaging in protected advocacy. This includes criticism of Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza, its forced starvation of civilians, ethnic cleansing of Palestinian communities, illegal land theft and occupation, settler violence, and apartheid policies. The policy also risks denying benefits to those who support boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaigns as a lawful, nonviolent means of advancing Palestinian rights.

In a statement, CAIR Government Affairs Director Robert S. McCaw said:

“USCIS has introduced sweeping Israel-First ideological tests that turn immigration officers into thought police. This guidance allows officials to deny life-changing benefits to American residents, students, and workers, not for any misconduct, but for lawful political expression, including opposition to genocide and support for boycotts.

“Immigrants should not have to choose between their immigration status and their conscience. Protected advocacy for Palestinian human rights must never be redefined as a national security threat.

“We are demanding that USCIS rescind this policy immediately. Congress must also conduct oversight to ensure that immigration adjudications are not politicized or manipulated to shield Israel from accountability.”

CAIR is urging:

USCIS to rescind Policy Alert PA-2025-16.

Congress to investigate and block the use of immigration law as a political weapon against free speech.

The administration to guarantee that opposition to genocide, apartheid, and land theft is never grounds for denying immigration benefits.

CAIR continues to monitor the implementation of this policy and encourages individuals experiencing discriminatory treatment to report cases immediately.

The agency has sued Denver and Colorado, along with several other cities and states, over their immigration policies.","Gov. Jared Polis and Denver’s city attorney defended state and local policies restricting cooperation with civil immigration enforcement in letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week, defying Trump administration demands that those limits be rescinded.

The letters, both sent Tuesday, responded to a Bondi letter from last week that told the state and its capital city that they had a week to detail how they would repeal laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Bondi, who sent identical letters to officials in other “sanctuary jurisdictions,” wrote that local leaders who didn’t cooperate “may be subject to criminal charges.”

Polis denied that Colorado fit the definition of a sanctuary state and asked Bondi to remove the state from the U.S. Department of Justice’s recent list describing it as such.

But he defended the constitutionality of state laws that limit government employees’ cooperation with immigration enforcement, except as part of a criminal investigation or as required by a judge.

“Colorado, like many states, will not allow the federal government to commandeer our public safety resources, and our right to do so is protected by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution,” Polis wrote. “We do not find any conflict between state and federal law in this matter, in fact our state laws require compliance with valid federal laws.”

The 10th Amendment establishes the limits of the federal government’s powers.

In a separate letter, Denver’s acting city attorney, Katie McLoughlin, told Bondi that Denver’s “welcoming city” ordinance — which similarly limits information- and resource-sharing with federal immigration authorities — was legal.

“We have no intention of changing the ordinance or our practices as we are committed to continuing to comply with the law,” she wrote.

Courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have generally upheld states’ ability to prevent the federal government from commandeering state resources, according to the National Immigration Forum and the American Immigration Council.

The Trump administration’s Justice Department is now challenging those rulings. The agency has sued Denver and Colorado, along with several other cities and states, over their immigration policies.

A judge in Illinois has already rejected Bondi’s lawsuit against that state and the city of Chicago, ruling that the suit was “an end-run around the Tenth Amendment.” The suit against Colorado and Denver is still active.

In a statement, Polis spokeswoman Ally Sullivan said Tuesday that Polis was “frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect (sanctuary jurisdiction) label and the lack of transparency from the federal administration on this and many other items.”

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan wrote. “The Governor encourages the federal administration — and Congress — to focus on actually securing the border, decreasing violent crime, increasing transparency, and passing real immigration reform.”

Denver city spokesman Jon Ewing struck a more defiant tone.

“Denver is not going to be bullied,” he wrote in a statement. “Not by the Trump administration, not by anyone. We have always followed the law and will continue fighting to protect the rights of our residents as well as the federal funding they are entitled to as taxpayers.”

Experts worry this novel state-run immigration detention model will allow Florida to create an “independent, unaccountable detention system” that runs parallel to the federal detention system.
What private vendors are being contracted to participate in operating the detention facility?
What oversight mechanisms are being implemented to ensure compliance with federal, state, and international law?
What consultations were done with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes before construction of the detention facility?","Washington, D.C. – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25) led 63 members of Congress to raise the alarm and demand immediate answers from the Trump Administration about the immigration detention camp in Florida’s Everglades region known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”

“Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health, and violate federal law. We ask that DHS promptly provide critical information for the American public to better understand this detention plan,” wrote the lawmakers to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons, FEMA Acting Administrator David Richardson, and DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari.

A federal judge has currently paused further construction at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ after the Miccosukee Tribe and environmental groups filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the detention facility “threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration.”

“The facility is expected to hold as many as 5,000 people, primarily in a combination of tents and trailers, ‘with no brick-and-mortar construction required.’ Human rights experts have condemned the plan as ‘cruel and inhumane’ by design,” the lawmakers stressed in their letter.

“Construction progressed at ‘turbo speed,’” the lawmakers continued, “and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the ‘hottest parts of the state.’ When Florida legislators visited the detention facility, they found temperatures exceeding 83 degrees in the tents without any detainees.”

In addition to Merkley and Wasserman Schultz, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), and Tina Smith (D-MN), and U.S. Representatives Kathy Castor (FL-14), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), Frederica S.

“Experts worry this novel state-run immigration detention model will allow Florida to create an ‘independent, unaccountable detention system’ that runs parallel to the federal detention system. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis touted that the facility will ‘cut through’ the standard legal process in federal immigration court, and the state will instead deputize the National Guard and ‘other folks in Florida’ as immigration judges within the facility, to facilitate rapid deportations,” the members of Congress cautioned.

They elaborated, “A Florida-run immigration detention system is particularly troubling given that, according to agency records, Florida has been the site of a whopping 40 percent of all deaths in ICE custody nationwide thus far in 2025. It is especially concerning that immigrants’ rights advocates in Florida have filed a lawsuit alleging that people detained at the facility have been denied access to counsel and ‘effectively have no way to contest their detention.’ With that said, this problematic and seemingly unlawful model may grow to expand beyond Florida: Secretary Noem has said, ‘Florida was unique in what they presented to us, and I would ask every other governor to do the exact same thing.’”

The lawmakers reiterated that ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ threatens human rights, due process, Tribal interests, and the environment. Given the clear and immediate risks posed by the facility, they directed DHS to respond to their questions by no later than the 3rd of September:

Full text of the letter can be found by clicking here and follows below:

Dear Secretary Noem, Acting Director Lyons, Acting Administrator Richardson, and Inspector General Cuffari:

We write regarding the State of Florida, in partnership with the federal government, building an immigration detention facility in the heart of the Everglades, which has been sarcastically dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” Last month, President Trump and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem visited the site. Brushing aside concerns from human rights watchdogs, environmentalist groups, and Tribal nations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has greenlit the construction of this expansive detention facility that may violate detained individuals’ human rights, jeopardize public and environmental health, and violate federal law. We ask that DHS promptly provide critical information for the American public to better understand this detention plan.

The Everglades site was selected precisely because of its remote location and harsh surroundings, which Florida officials reportedly view as “an ideal location to house and transport migrants.” Touting the remote location, officials have suggested that the facility will need minimal security because the area is naturally surrounded by “alligators and pythons,” and fleeing migrants would have “nowhere to hide.” President Trump recently joked that detained individuals who try to escape will likely be eaten by alligators and shrugged while saying that “this is not a nice business.”

The facility is expected to hold as many as 5,000 people, primarily in a combination of tents and trailers, “with no brick-and-mortar construction required.” Human rights experts have condemned the plan as “cruel and inhumane” by design. Construction progressed at “turbo speed,” and it remains unclear whether the facility has plans to ensure medical care, rapid hurricane evacuation, access to counsel, and sufficient infrastructure for sewage, running water, and temperature controls, despite being located in one of the “hottest parts of the state.” When Florida legislators visited the detention facility, they found temperatures exceeding 83 degrees in the tents without any detainees.

Although the land is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis used emergency powers to take control of the site. Reports suggest that the state of Florida is holding hundreds of people with no criminal record and others with legal immigration status, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) holders. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has stated that it will partner with Florida to detain migrants at the site pending deportation, but it is not clear what role ICE is playing in this detention center.

Experts worry this novel state-run immigration detention model will allow Florida to create an “independent, unaccountable detention system” that runs parallel to the federal detention system. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis touted that the facility will “cut through” the standard legal process in federal immigration court, and the state will instead deputize the National Guard and “other folks in Florida” as immigration judges within the facility, to facilitate rapid deportations.

Fundamentally, a state’s ability to participate in immigration enforcement is limited by the federal Supremacy Clause. The Supreme Court also reiterated that states are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting within its proper authority, has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance. A Florida-run immigration detention system is particularly troubling given that, according to agency records, Florida has been the site of a whopping 40 percent of all deaths in ICE custody nationwide thus far in 2025. It is especially concerning that immigrants’ rights advocates in Florida have filed a lawsuit alleging that people detained at the facility have been denied access to counsel and “effectively have no way to contest their detention.” With that said, this problematic and seemingly unlawful model may grow to expand beyond Florida: Secretary Noem has said, “Florida was unique in what they presented to us, and I would ask every other governor to do the exact same thing.”

Beyond human rights and due process issues, this plan raises serious environmental concerns. The site of the facility, the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, is a little-used airstrip that was initially built to anchor “the world’s largest airport,” but the airport was never built, primarily due to environmental challenges. The location is a highly-sensitive stretch of the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. Over the past 35 years, the federal government and Florida have jointly invested more than $10 billion into the Everglades to restore and protect its delicate ecosystem. Environmental experts warn that the increased activity will pose serious environmental risks—not only for the vulnerable wetlands but for the millions of people who rely on the area for access to freshwater. The vast wetlands are a major water source for more than 10 million South Floridians, with 300 million gallons of fresh water pumped out daily.

Furthermore, Tribal leaders have “denounced” plans to place a detention field on their ancestral lands that are home to 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages and several “ceremonial grounds, burial grounds, and gathering sites.” Not only would the facility harm the “cultural, spiritual and historical identity” of Miccosukee and Florida Seminole people, but tribal leaders have also expressed concerns that disruptions to the environment would negatively impact the ability of nearby tribes to “live, hunt, fish, gather and pray.”

While this detention facility may prove disastrous for human rights, due process, environmental, and Tribal interests, it is poised to be lucrative for private vendors. Reporting suggests that a “team of vendors” may be partnering with Florida officials to manage the facility, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

Given that DHS is working directly with the Florida state government on a detention facility with alarming implications, DHS should ensure transparency and accountability surrounding the facility’s financing operations. Therefore, we ask that you respond to the following questions by September 3, 2025:

Please provide a copy of any memoranda of understanding or other agreements between the state of Florida and DHS (or any of its components) related to the operation of this detention facility.

What legal authority allows the state of Florida to construct and operate any migrant detention facilities?

Please provide a detailed legal reasoning explaining how the cited legal authority allows the state of Florida to construct and operate a migrant detention facility?

Is this detention facility’s construction and operation under the direct control of the Department of Homeland Security as presented in Friends of the Everglades v. Noem (No. 25-22896-CV-WILLIAMS (2025)) or the State of Florda?

Is the facility subject to federal standards for the treatment of detainees, such as the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003 (P.L. 108-79)?

Have there been any inspections of detention standards at this facility since detainees were transferred in? If so, what were the findings?

What is the state licensed and unlicensed staff to detainee ratio? Please disaggregate by license type.

How can detainees file a complaint with the DHS Inspector General?

How can detainees file a complaint with the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties?

How can detainees file a complaint with the DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO)?

How can detainees request medical attention?

What private vendors are being contracted to participate in operating the detention facility?

What oversight mechanisms are being implemented to ensure compliance with federal, state, and international law?

What measures are being taken to ensure access to clean drinking water, food, sewage infrastructure, temperature regulation, and medical care for detained migrants?

Additionally, what measures are being taken to protect migrants from environmental conditions like floods, pests, dangerous animals, extreme heat, and potential hurricanes?

Were any environmental reviews conducted before construction of the facility? If so, what were the findings?

Provide a copy of the pre-inspection results and any post-inspection results that are available.

How will increased air traffic, development, water runoff, and general human activity affect the surrounding ecosystem?

What steps will be taken to prevent contamination of the freshwater source that supplies drinking water to 10 million Floridians?

Are minors detained at the facility? If yes, provide the ages of all minors in custody as of the date of this letter.

Are women detained at the facility?

What criteria is used to segregate detainees?

Please describe how the facility upholds due process requirements under the U.S. Constitution and Immigration and Nationality Act.

How does the facility facilitate in-person and virtual access to counsel? If so, how many attorney access meetings have occurred as of the date of this letter?

How does the facility facilitate access to screenings by asylum officers?

How does the facility manage attendance at immigration or state or federal court hearings?

What consultations were done with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes before construction of the detention facility?

How is the State of Florida complying with existing federal laws like the National Historic Preservation Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act?

What criteria if any did DHS provide for the approval of federal reimbursement?

How will the use of FEMA resources for the construction and operation of this facility impact federal and state-level readiness for responding to hurricane season?

Are federal Shelter and Services (SSP) grant funds financing this detention facility? If so, how will these funds be used in a manner consistent with federal statute prohibiting the use of SSP funds for custodial detention?

What is FEMA’s justification for awarding SSP funds as a sole source award to the State of Florida instead of through a competitive award process?

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Although these programs must follow certain federal guidelines, the finer details are determined individually by state law.
According to PBS, the plaintiffs argue that Administration’s requirement that programs adhere to immigration law could interfere with policies designed to allow victims and witnesses to report crimes without risking deportation.
“And their supposed reasoning here is unfounded: Rhode Island consistently cooperates with all federal law enforcement agencies, as required by federal law,” he wrote.
The DOJ has reportedly not responded to requests for comment from members of the press.","Maine has joined a coalition of twenty other Democrat-led states in suing the Trump Administration over its latest effort to crack down on so-called “sanctuary states.”

Under the Administration’s new policy, grants from the Office for Victims of Crime — housed under the Department of Justice (DOJ) — will not be awarded to any program that “violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law.”

Also ineligible for grant funding will be any program that “impedes or hinders the enforcement of federal immigration law,” including by failing to “give access to [Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] agents, or honor DHS requests.”

According to the states that signed onto the complaint, this condition is illegal because the Reagan-era law establishing the program does not mention immigration enforcement.

“The challenged conditions would force these States into an untenable position: either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law,” the plaintiffs argue in their lawsuit, which was filed in Rhode Island federal court.

“The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), an agency housed within the [DOJ] that is charged with administering [Victims of Crime Act (VOCA)] grants, has now declared that States will be unable to access VOCA funds unless they accede to the Executive Branch’s immigration enforcement priorities,” the complaint said.

The plaintiff states have collectively received about $500 million through this grant program since 2021.

The Attorneys General that signed onto the suit have argued that the Trump Administration’s policy looks to withhold as much as $1 billion in Congressionally approved funding.

Signed into law by President Ronald Reagan (R) in 1984, the VOCA created the Crime Victims’ Fund, which directs the proceeds from criminal fines, penalties, and forfeited bail bonds to victims compensation programs and victims assistance organizations. The Crime Victims’ Fund does not receive any taxpayer funding.

Although these programs must follow certain federal guidelines, the finer details are determined individually by state law.

According to PBS, the plaintiffs argue that Administration’s requirement that programs adhere to immigration law could interfere with policies designed to allow victims and witnesses to report crimes without risking deportation.

Newsweek reports that while some of the states involved in this lawsuit are officially considered to be sanctuary states, others have looser policies in place designed to shield those who are in the country illegally.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha shared a press release Monday announcing the lawsuit.

“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” he said.

“And their supposed reasoning here is unfounded: Rhode Island consistently cooperates with all federal law enforcement agencies, as required by federal law,” he wrote. “What we won’t, and can’t do legally, is divert important state law enforcement resources to do the federal government’s civil immigration law bidding.”

As of this article’s publication, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has not issued a statement speaking to Maine’s involvement in the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs in the case hope that the federal judge assigned to the case will block the Department of Justice [DOJ] from enforcing the challenged policy and, ultimately, void the immigration-related condition for receiving VOCA altogether.

Alongside Maine, Attorneys General from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin have all signed onto this lawsuit.

The DOJ has reportedly not responded to requests for comment from members of the press.

Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the DOJ “will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”",https://www.themainewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Maine-Attorney-General-Aaron-Frey-Responds-to-SCOTUS.png,N,,2025-08-20 15:57:06.909656

“You’re coming from India. How many other countries are you going through? And then you show up in the southern border and stay silent, like, what? Why don’t you get asylum somewhere else?

Furthermore, Trump's signature tax and spending legislation, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" allocates about $170 billion for border security and immigration enforcement.
At the end of fiscal year 2024, there were 29,677 cases pending in Detroit immigration court, according to the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.","Detroit — The ""Quinceañera,"" or 15th birthday, for girls in many Latino cultures marks a transition to womanhood.

That's why it's customary for many to get their hair and makeup done in preparation for the celebration. In the largely Latino immigrant community of southwest Detroit, Araceli Hernandez's Florbella Salon is a go-to spot.

She recently had one such appointment on the books. But it was abruptly canceled after the prospective client's father was detained by Immigration Customs and Enforcement and deported, Hernandez said.

The girl was one lost customer among many for the small business owner amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. In typical times, she's booked ""two-three weeks in advance"" but now that's far from the case. Hernandez estimates that she's doing 50% less in sales on the busiest day of the week this summer compared to last year.

She wonders if her shop on Michigan Avenue will be in business at this time next year. ""There's days where I sit here and I'm like, OK, what's going on?"" Hernandez said.

Small business owners in Michigan's largest Latino community say they are reeling amid President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation campaign. With some longtime customers being deported and others increasingly electing to leave the area, they describe a pervasive climate of fear around immigration enforcement that's deterring locals from being out in public, and in turn depressing foot traffic and sales.

""Economically, it's been a disaster,"" said Maria Hayes, who owns Ideas Marketing, a graphic design and printing service on southwest Detroit's main corridor, Vernor Highway.

More than financial strains, small business owners, an elected official and advocacy groups told The Detroit News that the marked slowdown in business represents an unraveling of the community's social fabric. The tight-knit neighborhood is rife with small businesses — many of them passed through generations — and their clientele is hyper-local.

""For us, as business owners, we feel this a lot, because it's our people, and we want our people to be with us,"" said Maria Gonzalez of La Mexicana Supermercado on a recent late morning, her grocery store empty of customers.

The sales slowdown in southwest Detroit is consistent with a broader trend.

The most recent available data from analytics firm Kantar shows that food and beverage sales among Hispanics in the United States dropped 4.3 percentage points from the first quarter of 2024 to that of 2025, while they slid only 0.1 percentage points among non-Hispanics in the same time frame. In the apparel category, sales among Hispanics slid 8.3 percentage points, and 0.1 percentage points for non-Hispanics.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Southwest Detroit's commercial downturn coincides with mounting scrutiny of the deportation campaign's effect on the economy. On the campaign trail last year, Trump routinely criticized former President Joe Biden for the stagnant economy while vowing to revitalize it.

But seven months on from Trump's second inauguration, the unemployment rate is ticking up, companies are increasingly passing tariff-related costs to consumers, and major industries have warned that the deportation campaign is reducing the workforce.

Julie Powers, executive director of Immigration Law and Justice Michigan, noted the state's agricultural industry, for example, is largely powered by immigrant labor, adding that she believes the immigration crackdown could have grave impacts on it.

“If you really care about money, fine,"" she said. ""Then why are you cheering on a death blow to Michigan’s economy?""

Businesses adjust

Business owners in southwest Detroit said they're looking for ways to boost sales and even out their balance sheets in spite of the slowdown.

Nancy Diaz, who owns La Palapa del Parian restaurant on Lawndale Street, said monthly revenues are dropping, and that typically busy times like the Memorial Day and July 4 weekends have been slow this year.

So it was, too, on a recent Wednesday around 1 p.m. After one group eating at a table in the outside section left, the colorfully-decorated restaurant was empty except for servers, chefs and a boy at a table in the sitting room playing on an iPad.

To boost sales, Diaz said she's trying to do more marketing ""outside the area"" and advertising the restaurant's ""Taco Tuesday"" deal: 30 tacos for $55.

Hernandez of Florbella Salon is also offering special deals: ""If they're going to get a couple things done, I can just give them something else for free."" However, that's becoming a heavier lift as the prices she pays for certain imported hair care supplies are increasing because of Trump's tariffs.

""I don't know how much can I do without affecting my own profits, my own pockets,"" Hernandez said.

The success of Hayes' business — Ideas Marketing — is largely predicated on the success of other businesses in the area. Most of her clients are other business owners in need of things like promotional materials, webpage design and branded uniforms. Because those clients are struggling themselves, Hayes said her business is feeling the strain acutely.

She's noticed a particular pullback in orders from construction companies, which make up a large share of her business. As laborers for those companies leave the area or stop showing up to work for fear of immigration enforcement, Hayes said owners aren't ordering as many uniforms as they typically do.

To soften the blow from the drop in sales, Hayes said she's had to raise prices and shorten employees' hours.

""It's super scary,"" Hayes said, workers behind her rolling out material, measuring and snipping it. The music video for Puerto Rican pop star Rauw Alejandro's hit ""Tu Con Él"" softly played from a television mounted on the wall.

'Fast, quickly and quietly'

While Trump sought to ramp up deportations in his first term, southwest Detroit small business owners said they saw no drop off in sales attributable to his immigration enforcement.

But since he returned to office in January — and has deployed a number of new, controversial tactics to ramp up deportations — they describe a wholly unprecedented impact on businesses and the community.

Those methods have included arresting people at courthouses once they exit their immigration hearings, raiding workplaces to make arrests, and broadening enforcement to encompass ""collaterals"" — people who aren't targets of ICE operations but whom agents come across in the course of business.

As part of the effort, the Trump administration has tapped several agencies for help that are typically uninvolved with immigration enforcement, ranging from the National Guard to the Drug Enforcement Administration and even the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Furthermore, Trump's signature tax and spending legislation, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" allocates about $170 billion for border security and immigration enforcement.

ICE arrests under Trump include a growing proportion of people with no U.S. criminal convictions or pending charges — 37% in July, compared with 13% in December, the Associated Press reported last week. It cited federal data compiled by the University of California at Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project.

“Many of the individuals that are counted as ‘non-criminals’ are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, told the AP. “They just don’t have a rap sheet in the U.S.”

The Guardian, a leading British newspaper, reported in June on a memo from ICE officials to subordinates encouraging them to ""turn the creative knob up to 11"" in immigration enforcement and ""push the envelope"" in conceiving new ways to ramp up deportations. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told Fox News in May that the administration had set a goal of 3,000 ICE arrests per day.

The government's broad efforts appear to have taken root in southwest Detroit. At the end of fiscal year 2024, there were 29,677 cases pending in Detroit immigration court, according to the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. Now, over halfway through fiscal year 2025, the backlog of cases has increased by nearly 1,000, to 30,670.

City Councilwoman Gabriela Santiago-Romero, whose district includes southwest Detroit, said she's getting calls from constituents ""every single day"" about new ICE detentions in the community.

ICE operations in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have attracted much public attention because of how atypical it is for immigration enforcement to be so pronounced in areas like those, which aren't on the U.S. border, she said. Because Detroit sits on the border with Canada, by comparison, Santiago-Romero said it's not ""shocking"" to see agents from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the area.

That doesn't mean the efforts in the area haven't been uniquely concerted of late, she said: ""Here, it doesn't look like the raids that you're seeing in those other cities, but here it's happening fast, quickly and quietly.""

'They don't want us here'

Business owners and advocacy groups framed the strains that southwest Detroit's economy is facing as undue punishment for the entire community.

""They’re going after people who have legal status here, people who’ve lived here for 20 years, have businesses, homes, children,"" said Lex Zavala, the interim executive director of the Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation. ""Our business district is empty now. Restaurants and construction can’t find enough workers to fill their space. It's not even just undocumented people that are scared.""

The slowdown, he continued, is hurting ""hardworking people that are coming here to build the American Dream just like previous immigrant populations in the past.""

Hernandez, the salon owner, noted the same widespread effect.

As ""one of those persons that tries to do everything legally, have everything, all the permits,"" she finds it unfair that Trump's immigration policy is, if indirectly, forcing her to consider closing her business.

For the moment, Hernandez is ""counting (her) blessings"" and remaining grateful for the business she's still seeing: ""We're hustlers, so we'll try to stay.""

But she also suggested those efforts feel increasingly out of reach: ""Sometimes it's hard, when they don't want us here.""

Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.

She touted the height of the wall as well as the depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And then Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.

""That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb.

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.

During Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress this summer.

Noem said they have been building about a half mile of barrier every day.

""The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,"" she said.

She said that in addition to barriers like the one she visited Tuesday, the department is also working on ""water-borne infrastructure."" Long sections of the roughly 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico sit along the Rio Grande River in Texas.

The courts refused to enforce the forum selection provision because there is no right to a jury trial in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The California Supreme Court granted review and reversed, holding that the forum selection provision was not unenforceable as a pre-dispute jury trial waiver.","The first half of 2025 saw numerous developments in the strategies and counterstrategies between corporations and their stockholders in efforts to find the most favorable law and courts to decide disputes between them.

Various media outlets have covered “DExit,” the trend of corporations considering or incorporating in a jurisdiction other than Delaware, based on the view that Delaware law and the Delaware Court of Chancery have become too stockholder friendly. The Delaware Legislature and Governor responded to DExit in the form of Senate Bill 21.

Many law firms and others have also published alerts this year about recent changes to the law in both Nevada and Texas, and the efforts in those states to establish business courts to compete with Delaware.

However, there has been less discussion about stockholder efforts to try to avoid Delaware as a forum for litigation and avoid application of the law of a corporation’s place of incorporation to intra-corporate disputes.

Recent cases from California and New York – two jurisdictions relevant to many corporations – saw key developments in these areas in 2025. This alert discusses the decisions in three such lawsuits.

Epicentrx, Inc. v. Superior Court

On July 21, 2025, the California Supreme Court issued a decision in a case styled Epicentrx, Inc. v. Superior Court, __ P.3d __, 2025 WL 2027272 (Cal. July 21, 2025) – with Epirx, LP (Epirx) as the real party in interest.

In that case, the trial court and California Court of Appeal denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens, based on a forum selection provision in Epicentrx’s certificate of incorporation setting the Delaware Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for most stockholder lawsuits. Id. at *1-3. The courts refused to enforce the forum selection provision because there is no right to a jury trial in the Delaware Court of Chancery.

The California Supreme Court granted review and reversed, holding that the forum selection provision was not unenforceable as a pre-dispute jury trial waiver. Id. at *13. The Court explained that the modern trend favors enforcement of voluntarily adopted forum selection clauses in contracts and otherwise. Id. at *6.

It further explained that “courts [should be] reluctant to decline enforcement of contractual [forum selection] provisions on public policy grounds, especially where no statute or constitutional provision directly speaks to the issue.” Id. at 7.

The Court acknowledged that California’s public policy supports the right to a jury trial and that such right is guaranteed in its constitution and by statute, but it also noted that the right can be waived and, most importantly, that these provisions “concern the right to a jury trial in California courts, not elsewhere.” Id. at 9.

The Court then distinguished between a forum selection provision and a pre-dispute jury trial waiver noting that “[t]he former reflects where a dispute will be litigated, while the latter reflects how it will be litigated.” Id. at *9 (emphasis in original).

Ezrasons, Inc. v. Rudd

In May 2025, the New York Court of Appeals issued two decisions concerning the application of New York law to disputes between stockholders and companies incorporated in foreign countries and the availability of a New York forum for such disputes.

In one case, Ezrasons, Inc. v. Rudd, __ N.E. 3d __, 2025 WL 14360000 (N.Y. May 20, 2025), the Court of Appeals held that the internal affairs doctrine – the principle that “the substantive law of the place of incorporation governs disputes relating to the rights and relationships of corporate shareholders and managers” – applied to a derivative lawsuit brought by a stockholder of Barclays PLC against current directors and officers of Barclays. Id. at *1.

The Court thus held that English law applied (as Barclays was incorporated in England), that the stockholder did not have standing to sue under English law, and that the case was properly dismissed. Id.

In so ruling, the Court rejected the stockholder’s argument that Sections 626(a) and 1319(a)(2) of the New York Business Corporations Law “displace[d] the internal affairs doctrine and mandate[d] application of New York substantive law to standing questions in shareholder derivative litigation brought” in New York. Id. at *3.

Specifically, the Court held that the language of Section 626(a) – “[a]n action may be brought in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by a holder of shares or of voting trust certificates of the corporation or of a beneficial interest in such shares or certificates”– provided New York courts with jurisdiction to hear derivative lawsuits brought on behalf of foreign corporations. Id. at *5. It sets forth the “minimum predicates for a New York court to entertain” a derivative lawsuit, but the substantive law of the place of incorporation still determines which stockholders have standing to bring such lawsuits. Id.

Similarly, the Court held that Section 1319(a)(2) – “doing business in this state” – provides the minimum standards for when a “foreign corporation” and “its directors, officers, and shareholders” can be sued in New York.

Haussman v. Baumann

In the other case from the New York Court of Appeals, Haussman v. Baumann, N.E.3d __, 2025 WL 1435989 (N.Y. May 20, 2025), the Court issued a two-page memorandum affirming the decision of the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division to dismiss a shareholder derivative action filed against a company incorporated in Germany on forum non coveniens grounds.

The Court of Appeals did not conduct its own detailed analysis. Rather, it held that the New York Supreme Court “considered all relevant factors [in connection with its decision as to whether to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds] and made no legal error in doing so.” Id. at __.

Nonetheless, like the New York Court of Appeals in Rudd discussed above, both the New York Supreme Court and the Supreme Court Appellate Division held that the internal affairs doctrine applied, that the company in question was incorporated in Germany, that German law thus governed the dispute, and that the plaintiff did not have standing to bring a stockholder derivative lawsuit under German law. See Haussmann v. Baumann, 157 N.Y.S.3d 355, at *2, *5, *6 (Supr. Ct. Dec. 27, 2021); Haussmann v. Baumann, 192 N.Y.S.3d 81, 82-83 (Supr. Ct., App. Div. June 22, 2023).

The Supreme Court also based its decision to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds, in part on its conclusion that German law applied to the dispute. Haussmann v. Baumann, 157 N.Y.S.3d 355, at *5.

Conclusion

There is a long history of jockeying between corporations and their stockholders about the law applicable to disputes between them and the forum in which such suits will be litigated. These decisions in California and New York (along with DExit, SB 21, and the developments in Nevada and Texas) simply reflect the developments thus far in 2025. New strategies and counterstrategies are expected to develop in the years ahead.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16336_0535.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 12:57:46.158662

It was later confirmed Shaw was at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, Thorward previously told the Times.
Unlike at the U.S.-Canada border, people at the Texas facility were nice, and more friendly, Shaw said.
She pointed out that by waiting three weeks to release her, immigration officials had spent thousands in flights, accommodation and food.
ICE still has her driver’s license, Washington state ID and passport, Shaw said, leaving her unable to get to work.","During the three weeks Sarah Shaw was held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, sleep came rarely.

She and her 6-year-old son found themselves at a Texas facility thousands of miles from their Everett home, sleeping on a bunk bed surrounded by strangers — all because of a paperwork issue.

“There wasn’t really privacy — no space or time to decompress from the situation,” Shaw said, recalling that harrowing period.

A Washington state employee and a resident of the state since 2021, Shaw is from New Zealand and holds valid work authorization in the U.S.

Released from detention late last week, she spoke Tuesday with The Seattle Times about her time in custody. From spending a night on the floor of a Border Patrol facility in Washington to flying to a detention center in Texas, to spending three weeks in incarceration with her youngest child, the mother of three is dealing with the fallout of being picked up by ICE.

“It was a pretty humiliating experience,” Shaw said.

“I just started crying”

Shaw, who works at the state Department of Children, Youth, and Families, was detained last month after dropping her elder two children off at Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia. They were flying to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.

On her way back to the U.S., the trouble started. Officials at the U.S.-Canada border told Shaw there was a problem with her paperwork.

Shaw holds a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that allows her to work in the U.S., according to her lawyer, Minda Thorward. The combo card can also function as a travel document, but Shaw didn’t realize that part of the card was no longer valid, Thorward said. Only the work authorization part had been recently renewed.

After waiting for hours in a Border Patrol facility that night, officials told Shaw she would be taken to Texas.

“I just started crying,” Shaw said.

Her son, whose travel documents were in order, would have to go with her. Shaw said she asked if a friend could come pick the boy up, but officials denied her request.

Shaw and her son slept on a mattress on the floor of a “family cell” in the facility, she said. A bright light was kept on all night.

A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson did not respond to specific questions, but emailed a statement Tuesday about Shaw’s case.

“When someone with an expired parole leaves the country and tries to reenter the U.S., they will be stopped in compliance with our laws and regulations,” the spokesperson wrote. “If they are accompanied by a minor, CBP will follow all protocols to keep families together or arrange care with a legal guardian.”

After morning broke, Shaw and the boy were taken to the airport for a flight to Texas.

“I was just tired”

Cruising out of Washington and toward the Southern border, Shaw, sitting with her son on the airplane, was filled with anxiety.

“The previous day-and-a-half was super traumatic, and I was just tired,” Shaw said.

She couldn’t know for sure what was going through her son’s head, but guessed he felt distressed at seeing his mom visibly upset.

After landing in Texas, a white van picked them up and they arrived at the detention facility, she said. Shaw couldn’t tell from the signs where exactly she was.

Shaw’s close friend Victoria Besancon and Thorward, her lawyer, reached out to officials in Washington state to help find her, Besancon said. Shaw was not entered into ICE’s locator system, Besancon added.

It was later confirmed Shaw was at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, Thorward previously told the Times.

Unlike at the U.S.-Canada border, people at the Texas facility were nice, and more friendly, Shaw said.

She and her son were in a room with seven other people. There were six bunk beds — and the group shared a TV and two tables.

“I wouldn’t say it was comfortable, but more comfortable than sleeping on the floor,” Shaw said.

Shaw and her son could go on the computer one hour a day, and there was a library — where, she estimated, 90% of the books were in Spanish. There was also a playground and gym.

ICE did not respond to specific questions but a spokesperson sent a statement Tuesday via email.

“ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” the spokesperson wrote.

Though surrounded by families, Shaw said the experience was “very isolating” because she didn’t know of anyone else who spoke English.

“I spent a lot of time on the [facility’s] phone,” she said.

For folks at home, it was challenging trying to get in touch with her, Besancon said. Thorward last week recounted similar difficulties communicating with her client while she was in custody.

“She can only call me,” Thorward said.

“They didn’t give me any details”

After three weeks of detention, Shaw was released Friday. ICE dropped Shaw and her son off in Laredo, Texas. From there, it was a 2 ½-hour Uber ride to San Antonio to catch their flight home.

Shaw said she was paroled out, something she had asked for when initially detained at the U.S.-Canada border, but that officials had denied. She pointed out that by waiting three weeks to release her, immigration officials had spent thousands in flights, accommodation and food.

“That’s thousands and thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money that could have been avoided,” she said.

Throughout the ordeal, Shaw said, she believed she wouldn’t be deported because she had the right to see an immigration judge due to her pending paperwork.

Now, she’s focused on getting to her next court date and resolving her immigration issues. ICE still has her driver’s license, Washington state ID and passport, Shaw said, leaving her unable to get to work.

An ankle monitor placed on her speaks in Spanish, even though Shaw does not understand the language.

“I don’t have anyone to contact about the ankle monitor, because they didn’t give me any details for anything,” she said.

Her two eldest children are still in New Zealand and will return in September, Shaw said. Looking back, the biggest thing she said she would want people to know about her experience is the “lack of communication” she got from ICE – whether about having to wear an ankle monitor or not being able to keep her driver’s license and ID.

“Just having a little bit of kindness, compassion and empathy goes really far when you’re dealing with a difficult situation,” Shaw said.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08192025_tzr_tzr_141111.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-20 12:57:31.859922

Chávez was admitted to a prison in the northern state of Sonora, an official told The Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. Chávez, 39, had a warrant for his arrest in Mexico for alleged arms and drug trafficking, and ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. Mexico attorney general Alejandro Gertz Manero previously revealed the investigation into Chávez started in 2019.

ICE arrested Chávez on July 2 in Los Angeles, days after losing to Jake Paul in a high-profile boxing fight. Chávez was arrested for overstaying his visa and lying on a green card application. The Department of Homeland Security said last month that Chávez overstayed a tourist visa, which expired in February 2024.

According to law enforcement, Chávez applied for Lawful Permanent Resident status in April 2024 on the grounds of his marriage to a U.S. citizen.

Immigrants will leave Clark County if they’re placed under more duress from authorities.","Clark County considers a resolution urging cooperation with ICE, raising concerns about potential racial profiling.

Supporters claim undocumented immigrants strain resources, while critics fear increased deportations and community distrust.

The resolution is non-binding and distinct from the 287(g) program, aiming to encourage cooperation with lawful federal orders.

Clark County is considering a resolution that would encourage local officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, a move critics say could lead to racial profiling and wrongful detentions.

The county’s Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the resolution at its Aug. 21 meeting in Neillsville.

Some places in Clark County, such as Abbotsford and Colby, have a high percentage of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, many working in the food industry and on dairy farms.

Under the non-binding resolution, county and other local government agencies would be encouraged to assist Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities when called upon, including honoring ICE detainer requests, providing necessary information, and facilitating the identification and apprehension of individuals unlawfully present in the United States.

The resolution, proposed by Supervisor Brandon Hasz, claims that an influx of undocumented immigrants has strained housing markets in rural Wisconsin, citing Whitewater in southeast Wisconsin as an example.

Moreover, the resolution claims that undocumented immigrants have placed a strain on Clark County’s social welfare programs and public health department, “which already face fiscal challenges in meeting the needs of legal residents, let alone illegal immigrants.”

Critics say those are false allegations. They say immigrants come to Clark County for jobs, not social services, and that many of those jobs would go unfilled if it weren’t for immigrants.

The resolution follows actions taken in other Wisconsin counties under a federal program known as 287g, which allows local law enforcement agencies to enter into an agreement with ICE in enforcing immigration laws.

That program has sparked controversy, with critics saying it leads to racial profiling and erodes trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. Critics also say it can result in increased detention and deportation of individuals with little or no criminal history.

Supporters of the Clark County resolution say it would not commit the county to a contractual agreement with ICE and isn't part of 287g.

“We were just trying to do a resolution that would exhort our county employees to assist when presented with a lawful (federal) order,” Hasz said.

Clark County Sheriff Kerry Kirn did not return a Journal Sentinel call asking about how the resolution would affect his department.

It would create fear in cities like Abbotsford, said Rubens Silva, a case management and health coordinator with HOLA, an organization focused on improving access to healthcare, community services and legal resources for the Latino community in central Wisconsin.

Immigrants will leave Clark County if they’re placed under more duress from authorities. That, in turn, would harm the local economy where immigrants support businesses and pay taxes, according to Silva.

“They will move to another county where the police department is not aligned with ICE to start a deportation process,” he said.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/20/PMJS/85737750007-mjs-250806-abbotsford-p-2.jpg?crop=5654,3182,x0,y374&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-20 11:58:14.777661

The video is about two minutes long and shows the struggle that ensued as concerned community members watched and recorded, including Cynthia Daggett.

""They may have had a warrant, it may have been a legitimate stop, but very hard to trust that,"" Daggett said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement wouldn't answer if it had a warrant or not, but immigration attorney Gloria Contreras Edin says ICE is operating within the law.

""It is clear that ICE has the authority to arrest someone without any written documentation handed to an individual before the arrest,"" Contreras Edin said.

In a statement, ICE officials said:

""For more than two decades, illegal alien Javier Yanez Morales, has put the public at risk for repeatedly and selfishly choosing to drink and drive, showing reckless disregard for the safety of others. This same disregard extends to immigration law which Morales has violated for just as long. Morales has been illegally entering the United States as far back as 1998, but despite being previously deported to Mexico he continued to commit crimes including domestic assault and false reporting. When ICE officers moved to take him into custody in Minneapolis, he resisted arrest. A passenger who interfered only escalated the situation, creating unnecessary danger for themselves, bystanders, and the officers.""

WCCO has confirmed Morales was charged with DWI with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 in July.

Voces Unidas President and CEO Alex Sanchez filed two complaints on Aug. 14 with Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office over incidents involving the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office and the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which covers Routt, Moffat and Grand counties.

Voces Unidas shared both complaints with the Post Independent.

Sanchez said the incidents, which involved some communication between those offices and ICE, raised concern because of state laws that restrict information sharing and coordination with federal immigration enforcement officials.

“Our organization has been hearing from community members in the Western Slope, in particular, about some of the distrust that they have with our local governments,” Sanchez said in an interview.

Colorado lawmakers over the past several years have moved to limit ICE’s reach in local communities, starting with a major law in 2019 that prohibits law enforcement from complying with ICE “detainers,” which is a request by the federal agency to hold someone in jail past their release time so that they may be taken into federal custody.

That law also prevents law enforcement from sharing immigration-related information about an individual with ICE, and makes it illegal for local authorities to arrest someone just based on their immigration status.

Other laws passed in 2021 and 2025 block state agencies, judicial and legislative branches, as well as local governments, from sharing an individual’s personal information with ICE, unless it is for a federal criminal investigation where a judge has issued a warrant. The 2025 law, Senate Bill 276 , also carries a $50,000 fine per violation.

ICE activity has been top of mind for advocates as the federal government expands immigration enforcement operations across the country, including in Colorado’s mountain towns . ICE is also reportedly planning to double its detention spaces this year with new facilities, including three planned in Colorado, according to reporting by The Washington Post .

Sanchez said it’s important for state and local agencies not to be seen by the immigrant community as an extension of ICE, which he worries would have a chilling effect on people’s participation with law enforcement. He said his organization is not interested in what a person’s criminal charges are, just that state laws and due process are being upheld.

“What Voces Unidas is interested in is ensuring that we don’t erode the public trust between the community and our local municipalities and local police departments,” he said.

Both the Garfield County sheriff and the district attorney for the 14th Judicial District say they complied with state laws and deny any wrongdoing.

When reached for comment, Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario said he was unaware of the complaint filed against his office, while District Attorney Matt Karzen learned about the allegations against his office from a post Voces Unidas made on its website last week. The group also posted about the Garfield County incident .

Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for Weiser’s office, did not comment on the complaints.

Man taken into ICE custody in Garfield jail’s sallyport

The complaint lodged against Vallario’s office centers around a man who was arrested and jailed in Garfield County on Aug. 8 and released later that day into ICE custody.

Sanchez said Voces Unidas spoke with the man’s family after he’d been detained by ICE, and the organization called the jail in Glenwood Springs to confirm what happened. According to the complaint, they were told by a sheriff’s deputy that the man had “bonded out” and was taken into ICE custody in the jail’s sallyport, which is used for secure entrances and exits.

Sanchez said the incident “felt like the transfer of an inmate,” which spurred suspicion from Voces Unidas that it could have violated restrictions on ICE collaboration. He said the man should have been allowed to leave the jail, after which point ICE could have detained him.

“He was not allowed to the freedom that he absolutely deserved because he was already bonded out,” Sanchez said. “It wasn’t like ICE was across the street and this was an encounter of chance.”

Vallario said the man was charged with resisting arrest, a protection order violation, driving without a license, fictitious license plates, open containers for alcohol and marijuana, and driving without taillights. He said he isn’t aware of any federal criminal charges against the man.

Vallario confirmed in a phone interview that the man was detained by ICE in the jail’s sallyport and said there’s “nothing that I’m aware of that prohibits us from making that transfer” in that area.

SB 276 does require public buildings like schools, libraries and child care centers to develop policies for giving ICE access to non-public spaces. But it does not prevent immigration officers from operating in private sections of government buildings, like jails, if given permission.

It is common practice for law enforcement to tell ICE when an inmate is going to be released from a jail, Vallario added. He said his office does not hold people for ICE or share information about their immigration status, which would be a violation of state law.

“Once they’re released from custody, it is up to (ICE), whether or not they want to come and pick them up and hold them or not,” Vallario said. “In this particular case, it appears they did.”

Violeta Chapin, an immigration law professor at the University of Colorado School of Law in Boulder, said law enforcement officials can communicate with ICE about an inmate’s release under state law.

She said ICE can also perform operations under “administrative warrants,” which are signed by immigration officials, not a judge.

“Immigration officials are allowed to execute administrative warrants in public places, or, if they’re given permission to enter (non-public spaces),” said Chapin, who has a background in assisting immigrants’ legal cases as head of the university’s pro bono immigration defense clinic.

Chapin added, however, that even if an agency like a sheriff’s office is following the law, its actions can lead to a perception in the community that it’s helping ICE with detainments.

“That will have consequences for how people in the community see local law enforcement,” Chapin said.

Vallario has expressed frustration with the state’s immigration laws, and earlier this year wrote a column explaining what his office is, and isn’t, allowed to do under state laws.

Garfield County has also pushed back on claims of being a “sanctuary” community. Commissioners last year passed a resolution rejecting the term, which was condemned by local immigration leaders who called the resolution’s language “divisive.”

The resolution said people who enter the country illegally can pose a “significant public health and safety risk,” tying them to increased crime, disease and demand on public infrastructure and services.

Prosecutor in Steamboat discussed ‘detainer’ on defendant in court

Sanchez’s other complaint is against the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which had received information from ICE about the potential detainment of a defendant in district court that was then discussed in a court hearing last month.

Court transcripts show that during a July 31 bond hearing in Steamboat Springs, Deputy District Attorney Joseph Bucci told Judge Erin Wilson he had “received information from the federal government that ICE has lodged a detainer against this defendant.”

The defendant in the Steamboat Springs case, a woman, was arrested for theft and felony identity theft . She had been arrested alongside a man, who faces the same charges and also has charges of felony identity theft in Adams County, according to the district attorney’s office.

All of those are state charges, and the district attorney’s office said it is not aware of any federal charges or warrants.

Sanchez said information sharing with federal immigration officials is only allowed during federal criminal investigations, and questioned why the district attorney’s office would be communicating with ICE to learn about a detainer and why it would be discussed during a bond hearing over state charges.

He added that a detainer — a request by ICE for local law enforcement to hold someone — shouldn’t be relevant since Colorado authorities aren’t allowed to comply with the request.

“Again, we need the public to trust local DAs. We need the public to be able to report crimes. We need the public to want to come to court,” Sanchez said. “We need the system to work and to work for everyone.”

Karzen, the district attorney, said asking ICE if a detainer has been lodged against a defendant is not the same as sharing immigration-related information with ICE. He said the practice is within state law and necessary for his office to do its job.

Karzen learned about the allegations made by Voces Unidas after a county commissioner reached out to his office to inquire about the post that was made on the advocacy group’s website.

When reached for comment over email, Karzen shared an Aug. 13 email he’d sent to Routt County Attorney Lynaia South in which he explained the process for reaching out to ICE about detainers.

Karzen said his office has periodically gotten cases where the accused person has a criminal history that indicates they have previously been removed from the country by ICE.

“With the increase in immigration enforcement, we began to see cases where ICE detained the person but we did not know about it,” meaning that person would not appear in court, Karzen wrote.

Karzen said his office has started to ask ICE when defendants are in their custody if they believe someone may have been detained and/or removed in the past, as noted in their criminal history. If someone is in ICE detention, Karzen said his office needs to know so they can adjust accordingly, such as obtaining a video court appearance from the defendant in an ICE facility.

In the Steamboat Springs case, Karzen said both defendants had identifications of prior detention and/or removals, and that the deputy district attorney needed to know if ICE was intending to detain and/or deport the defendants in the case so he could make decisions around bonds, a plea and sentencing agreement, or any victim interactions required under the Victims’ Rights Act. He also said it is important for court scheduling and case management.

Karzen said asking ICE about the status of a defendant as it relates to detention is the extent of his office’s interactions with the federal agency. He added that his office is requesting information, not providing it to ICE.

Chapin, the CU law professor, said she would argue that discussing someone’s detainer in state court is irrelevant to their criminal proceedings. But she said prosecutors aren’t prohibited from having or sharing that information in court.

In an emailed response to questions from the Post Independent Karzen called Voces Unidas’ complaint against his office “profoundly disappointing,” saying the group never reached out to his office “for comment, or to articulate their concerns or ask for an explanation.”

“Voces Unidas appears to be an important vehicle of advocacy on the Western Slope in an area where such advocacy has perhaps never been more important,” Karzen said, “and yet their lack of due diligence and apparent apathy as to the full truth regarding these matters is exactly the kind of thing that can destroy credibility.”

Legal battles arise

Sanchez said Voces Unidas sent both complaints to the attorney general’s office “so that they can actually review the facts, have conversations, and then make a determination whether in fact there was inappropriate behavior or not.”

Sanchez said the enactment of SB 276 earlier this year provides local groups with an important tool for accountability since it carries, for the first time, fines for violations.

Whether the attorney general’s office will act on the complaints is unclear. Pacheco, the spokesperson, declined to say how many complaints the office has received following the enactment of SB 276.

The law has, however, already sparked several legal battles, including a July 22 lawsuit filed by Weiser’s office against a Mesa County Sheriff’s Office deputy who allegedly shared information with federal immigration officials that led to the arrest of a Utah college student who had an expired visa.

Mesa County later countersued, claiming that the state law is too vague.

Another lawsuit was filed on June 4 against Gov. Jared Polis by Scott Moss, the head of the Colorado Division of Labor Standards and Statistics. Moss alleges that Polis sought to force his department to provide information to ICE regarding 35 state-vetted adult sponsors who were housing unaccompanied immigrant children.

Moss said the request from ICE was not backed by a court-issued warrant and that complying with it would violate the state’s laws on information sharing.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/6/2025/08/19140238/Sanchez-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 14:56:54.043584

Lizette Becerra, who works within the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), visited Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, 18, in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention on Sunday.
The agents told him they needed to take him to be fingerprinted anyway, to confirm his identity, and took his dog.

Becerra said that, as a teacher, her job had certainly changed from how it was before the summer break.","A Los Angeles teacher whose student was detained by federal agents while he walked his dog has told Newsweek that she believes mistaken bounty hunters plucked him off the street.

Lizette Becerra, who works within the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), visited Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, 18, in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention on Sunday.

""For about seven days, he could not change, he was in his pajama shorts and slippers. He couldn't bathe. He couldn't brush his teeth. He was sleeping next to a toilet where he had to wake up every time someone went so that he wouldn't get urinated on,"" Becerra said.

""It wasn't until Saturday morning that he was finally able to shower and was issued clothes,"" she said, adding that he told her he lost weight, as well.

Newsweek reached out to ICE for comment on Friday and Tuesday, but has yet to receive a response.

Teen Was Arrested While Walking His Dog

Guerrero-Cruz is currently being held in the Adelanto Detention Facility, on the edge of Victorville outside of L.A. Before that, Becerra said, he had been moved between two other facilities in the city itself since his arrest around two weeks ago.

""He says about 15 men, plain clothes with vests that said: 'Immigration Police' on them, in three SUVs, came up to him and just grabbed him and started calling him by another name,"" Becerra said, adding that the teen tried to tell the men he was not the person they were looking for.

The agents told him they needed to take him to be fingerprinted anyway, to confirm his identity, and took his dog. Becerra said she believed the men were bounty hunters of some kind, who had been looking for a different person but still took Guerrero-Cruz in.

""These people had his dog, unclipped the dog and stomped at the floor so that it could run away. Eventually it did make it back,"" Becerra said.

Guerrero-Cruz was taken to a post office parking lot, where he was held by the men before official ICE agents arrived and transferred him to federal custody. En route, he allegedly heard the agents bragging they would get paid at least $1,500 for his arrest and would drink well that night, Becerra said.

A 'Funny, Sweet Kid'

Guerrero-Cruz came to the L.A. area in 2023, Becerra told Newsweek, where he joined her class for newly arrived immigrants wanting to learn English.

She taught him for five months before he headed to Reseda Charter High School, where he was due to start his senior year this past week.

""He was a very memorable kid. I knew exactly who he was. He was a funny, sweet kid,"" the teacher said. ""I remember that if we ever had independent work, a lot of times I had to pull up a chair right next to my desk because he just wanted to talk and so I would just hear him out.""

Becerra explained that many of the immigrant children she has worked with have some form of trauma or another, including separation from their parents and the difficulties of navigating life as an immigrant in the U.S. She said that she puts a lot of heart into her students and that she was heartbroken to hear of Guerrero-Cruz's arrest.

""With everything going here going on here in Los Angeles, I kind of knew this day was going to come and I just was praying that it wasn't, and it did,"" she said.

The Van Nuys community has rallied around the student, raising thousands via GoFundMe to help with legal costs and to support his mother and siblings.

The LAUSD previously told Newsweek that it was committed to protecting every one of its students during heightened immigration enforcement in the city, and that safety measures had been heightened for the new school year.

Becerra said that, as a teacher, her job had certainly changed from how it was before the summer break. While she would check her classroom exits for potential active shooters, now she is on the lookout for federal agents who might take one of her kids.

""We as a school district and teachers at large are operating in a world where we assume that the law is still respected and that our rights are going to be respected, and, unfortunately, what's happening on the street is not the case,"" Becerra said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2705520/benjamin-guerrero-cruz.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 15:56:49.953109

The new facility, nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz, is facing allegations that its hundreds of detainees are unable to properly communicate with lawyers, did not have access to an immigration court until recently and are living in inhumane conditions.

A second lawsuit alleges that the makeshift detention center, made up of tents and trailers and surrounded by wetlands and wildlife, is also being built unlawfully within a sensitive habitat for endangered species.

TRUMP SAYS ONLY WAY OUT OF ‘ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ’ IS DEPORTATION

The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the first complaint on behalf of several detained migrants, saw a small setback Monday night when Judge Rodolfo Ruiz said its claims should have been brought in the Middle District of Florida rather than in the Southern District.

Ruiz, a Trump appointee, said the case must be transferred to that district, finding that the alleged violations occurred at the facility, which is located in Collier County, about 50 miles from Miami.

The ACLU, along with other groups, argued in their lawsuit that some detainees were not given the ability to communicate confidentially with an attorney and that up until recently, the Trump administration had not designated any immigration court as having jurisdiction over the detained migrants, of which there were about 700.

SELF-DEPORT OR END UP IN 'ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ,' NOEM WARNS MIGRANTS DURING TRUMP VISIT

""This is an unprecedented situation where hundreds of detainees are held incommunicado, with no ability to access the courts, under legal authority that has never been explained and may not exist,"" the plaintiffs' attorneys wrote.

Although not part of their legal claims, the attorneys said their clients were being held in ""harsh and inhumane conditions"" that included one meal per day, no access to daily showers, excessive force by guards and a lack of medical care. They are ""kept around the clock in a cage inside a tent,"" the attorneys said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which is working in coordination with the state of Florida to build Alligator Alcatraz, disputed claims by detainees of poor conditions.

""Here are the facts: Alligator Alcatraz does meet federal detention standards,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. ""All detainee facilities are clean. Any allegations of inhumane conditions are FALSE. When will the media stop peddling hoaxes about illegal alien detention centers and start focusing on American victims of illegal alien crime?""

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has said the facility is designed to be temporary and a means of alleviating the burden on other detention centers. DeSantis has said he hopes Alligator Alcatraz, which was constructed on an airport, will be a ""force multiplier"" for Trump's aggressive deportation agenda.

Williams placed a 14-day hold on all construction of the facility, but that order is set to expire Aug. 21.

But with the arrival of peak Atlantic hurricane season, immigrants and their advocates say President Donald Trump’s robust immigration enforcement agenda has increased the danger.
Since January, hundreds of law enforcement agencies have signed 287(g) agreements, allowing them to perform certain immigration enforcement actions.
That unsettled even families with permanent legal status, said Rae Cardenas, executive director of Doyle Community Center in Kerrville, Texas.
Florida’s Division of Emergency Management did not respond to questions related to its policies toward people without legal status.","If a major hurricane approaches Central Florida this season, Maria knows it’s dangerous to stay inside her wooden, trailer-like home. In past storms, she evacuated to her sister’s sturdier house. If she couldn’t get there, a shelter set up at the local high school served as a refuge if needed.

But with accelerating detentions and deportations of immigrants across her community of Apopka, 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Orlando, Maria, an agricultural worker from Mexico without permanent U.S. legal status, doesn’t know if those options are safe. All risk encountering immigration enforcement agents.

“They can go where they want,” said Maria, 50, who insisted The Associated Press not use her last name for fear of detention. “There is no limit.”

Natural disasters have long posed singular risks for people in the United States without permanent legal status. But with the arrival of peak Atlantic hurricane season, immigrants and their advocates say President Donald Trump’s robust immigration enforcement agenda has increased the danger.

Places considered neutral spaces by immigrants such as schools, hospitals and emergency management agencies are now suspect, and advocates say agreements by local law enforcement to collaborate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement make them more vulnerable and compel a choice between being physically safe and avoiding detention.

“Am I going to risk the storm or risk endangering my family at the shelter?” said Dominique O’Connor, an organizer at the Farmworker Association of Florida. “You’re going to meet enforcement either way.”

For O’Connor and for many immigrants, it’s about storms. But people without permanent legal status could face these decisions anywhere that extreme heat, wildfires or other severe weather could necessitate evacuating, getting supplies or even seeking medical care.

Federal and state agencies have said little on whether immigration enforcement would be suspended in a disaster. It wouldn’t make much difference to Maria: “With all we’ve lived, we’ve lost trust.”

New policies deepen concerns

Efforts by Trump’s Republican administration to exponentially expand immigration enforcement capacity mean many of the agencies active in disaster response are increasingly entangled in immigration enforcement.

Since January, hundreds of law enforcement agencies have signed 287(g) agreements, allowing them to perform certain immigration enforcement actions. Most of the agreements are in hurricane-prone Florida and Texas.

Florida’s Division of Emergency Management oversees building the state’s new detention facilities, like the one called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades. Federal Emergency Management Agency funds are being used to build additional detention centers around the country, and the Department of Homeland Security temporarily reassigned some FEMA staff to assist ICE.

The National Guard, often seen passing out food and water after disasters, has been activated to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations and help at detention centers.

These dual roles can make for an intimidating scene during a disaster. After floods in July, more than 2,100 personnel from 20 state agencies aided the far-reaching response effort in Central Texas, along with CBP officers. Police controlled entry into hard-hit areas. Texas Department of Public Safety and private security officers staffed entrances to disaster recovery centers set up by FEMA.

That unsettled even families with permanent legal status, said Rae Cardenas, executive director of Doyle Community Center in Kerrville, Texas. Cardenas helped coordinate with the Mexican Consulate in San Antonio to replace documents for people who lived behind police checkpoints.

“Some families are afraid to go get their mail because their legal documents were washed away,” Cardenas said.

In Florida, these policies could make people unwilling to drive evacuation roads. Traffic stops are a frequent tool of detention, and Florida passed a law in February criminalizing entry into the state by those without legal status, though a judge temporarily blocked it.

There may be fewer places to evacuate now that public shelters, often guarded by police or requiring ID to enter, are no longer considered “protected areas” by DHS. The agency in January rescinded a policy of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to avoid enforcement in places like schools, medical facilities and emergency response sites.

The fears extend even into disaster recovery. On top of meeting law enforcement at FEMA recovery centers, mixed-status households that qualify for help from the agency might hesitate to apply for fear of their information being accessed by other agencies, said Esmeralda Ledezma, communications associate with the Houston-based nonprofit Woori Juntos. “Even if you have the right to federal aid, you’re afraid to be punished for it,” Ledezma said.

In past emergencies, DHS has put out messaging stating it would suspend immigration enforcement. The agency’s policy now is unclear.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email that CBP had not issued any guidance “because there have been no natural disasters affecting border enforcement.” She did not address what directions were given during CBP’s activation in the Texas floods or whether ICE would be active during a disaster.

Florida’s Division of Emergency Management did not respond to questions related to its policies toward people without legal status. Texas’ Division of Emergency Management referred The Associated Press to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s office, which did not respond.

Building local resilience is a priority

In spite of the crackdown, local officials in some hurricane-prone areas are expanding outreach to immigrant populations. “We are trying to move forward with business as usual,” said Gracia Fernandez, language access coordinator for Alachua County in Central Florida.

The county launched a program last year to translate and distribute emergency communications in Spanish, Haitian Creole and other languages. Now staffers want to spread the word that county shelters won’t require IDs, but since they’re public spaces, Fernandez acknowledged there’s not much they can do if ICE comes.

“There is still a risk,” she said. “But we will try our best to help people feel safe.”

As immigrant communities are pushed deeper into the shadows, more responsibility falls on nonprofits, and communities themselves, to keep each other safe.

Hope Community Center in Apopka has pushed local officials to commit to not requiring IDs at shelters and sandbag distribution points. During an evacuation, the facility becomes an alternative shelter and a command center, from which staffers translate and send out emergency communications in multiple languages. For those who won’t leave their homes, staffers do door-to-door wellness checks, delivering food and water.

“It’s a very grassroots, underground operation,” said Felipe Sousa Lazaballet, the center’s executive director.

Preparing the community is challenging when it’s consumed by the daily crises wrought by detentions and deportations, Sousa Lazaballet said.

“All of us are in triage mode,” he said. “Every day there is an emergency, so the community is not necessarily thinking about hurricane season yet. That’s why we have to have a plan.”

A Kansas City man riding his bike along the Trolley Track Trail felt his initial fear confirmed when a Waldo area construction site came into view.

He saw handcuffed laborers, men he assumed to be Latino, being questioned by other men in tactical gear.

“My full intent was to stop and let them know that someone was watching,” said the man, who didn’t want to be publicly identified.

He wasn’t the only one who saw what many assumed was an immigration raid in the heart of Waldo in mid-July.

Others shared their outrage on social media. And the man riding his bike took photos and a video that showed some of the men wore tactical gear marked U.S. Marshals Service.

But was it an immigration raid?

The construction workers were released when a small crowd of bystanders gathered, some drawn from businesses along Wornall Road.

Tensions quickly escalated as bystanders began yelling and cursing. At least one agent who identified himself as a U.S. marshal cursed back, said the man who took photos.

The incident is now part of a growing list being documented by local advocates for immigrant rights. They’re tracking dozens of possible immigration actions, watching for patterns and trying to tamp down unsubstantiated rumors before they spread.

The Waldo incident has not been confirmed as an immigration raid.

So far, only about a dozen incidents in the Kansas City area have been verified as immigration enforcement actions since President Donald Trump took office in late January, according to Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, or AIRR.

Many more reported incidents could not be verified, or simply turned out to be someone receiving a ticket for a traffic violation, with no issues involving immigration.

The value of the ‘silent observer’

Amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, civil rights advocates nationally and locally are emphasizing training for bystanders and a heightened attention to nonviolent protests.

Janet Murguía understands that Latinos and other allies are angry about reports of federal officials arresting people at workplaces, in their homes and even when they go, as directed, to immigration court.

“But that outrage needs to be targeted in the right ways,” said Murguía, the president and CEO of UnidosUS. “It cannot give more fuel to this administration to … bring in more law enforcement.”

UnidosUS is the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. The group held its annual convention in Kansas City Aug. 4-7.

Training in nonviolence while advocating for immigrant rights was a recurring theme during the conference.

Know Your Rights

The actions of even one rambunctious protester can quickly escalate and incite others. Often unsubstantiated rumors spread quickly via social media.

The Department of Homeland Security reports escalating numbers of attacks on federal immigration agents and other federal partners, which can include the U.S. Marshals Service.

A June DHS release following the outbreak of protests in Los Angeles said there had been a 413% increase in assaults against federal agents from the same time last year. It also said that agents and their families had been doxed, which has been a reason that the government has given to defend the use of face masks.

The fact that a bystander had a child present during the July arrests of 11 workers at two area El Toro Loco restaurants was also called out in a Homeland Security statement.

“ICE was carrying out a criminal federal search warrant to rescue victims of human trafficking. Extremists and activists, one with their child in tow, tried to interfere with law enforcement by storming the restaurant, calling law enforcement Nazis, and attempting to keep officers from leaving the scene,” said DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin.

“Unfortunately, these types of smears and obstruction to law enforcement operations are becoming more and more common. Our brave ICE law enforcement are facing an 830% increase in assaults against them as they carry out operations.”

Statements by Homeland Security consistently highlight the administration’s goal of targeting violent criminals.

But the government’s own data shows that less than half of people arrested from late January through late June had been convicted of a crime, according to information gathered by the Deportation Data Project through Freedom of Information Act requests and analysis by news organizations like Stateline.

And among those who do have criminal convictions, for many it was for a less serious issue, like a traffic conviction.

Only 7% had been convicted of a violent crime, according to Stateline.

A person’s immigration status is a civil matter.

In training sessions, Kansas City area organizers seek to redirect those who might become agitated when interacting with federal immigration agents or other law enforcement.

If a volunteer demonstrates a fervent desire to fight fascism, or to accuse people of being Nazis, they probably need to reassess before becoming involved.

There’s more at stake with local organizing than what some people who want to lend support as an ally might realize, said immigrant rights advocates and immigration attorneys.

For example, videos taken by bystanders could be useful in legal cases challenging the constitutionality of the tactics being used by federal agents during arrests.

But videos with people screaming slurs at federal agents can be less useful.

Such actions can also undercut the philosophy of nonviolence.

Civil rights struggles require a consistent, long-term strategy to succeed, said Trinidad Raj Molina, an organizer with Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation.

Dramatic actions might feel good in the moment, Molina said, but aren’t a part of strategies designed to bring significant social change.

“Being a silent observer is important,” said Molina.

Lessons on nonviolence

Murguía is leaning into her friendship with the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis for guidance.

Through the years, she heard the Georgia congressman speak about nonviolence to groups large and small, often emphasizing lessons he learned over a lifetime fighting for voting rights, desegregation and so much more.

“I remember repeatedly hearing him say that civil disobedience requires courage,” she said. “And that the part of courage that people don’t understand is being brave enough not to respond with violence, and how critically important it is to understand the role of nonviolent civil disobedience and peaceful protests.”

UnidosUS is partnering with other national organizations like the National Urban League to call for more immigrant rights training sessions around such disciplines and to learn from the civil rights legacy of the African American community.

Martin Luther King Jr. taught that nonviolence is not passive. It focuses on injustice, rather than individuals. It’s a way of life, not a tactic.

People today might not realize how much training was involved in some of the most famous civil rights actions of the 1950s, Murguía said.

Murguía is especially aware that protesters today might be goaded to react, which can then be used as a pretext for a more militarized response by government officials.

Congress recently authorized more than $170 billion for increased immigration enforcement, which is more than the combined budgets of all other federal law enforcement agencies, Murguía said.

That point was also underscored by labor rights leader David Huerta, who said it is imperative that people who protest are disciplined and committed to nonviolence and understand how to deescalate situations.

Huerta spoke on a panel during the UnidosUS conference in Kansas City.

“When you do see violence, you have to deescalate it,” he said. “Because it can escalate so quickly.”

Huerta is president of the Service Employees International Union of California and first came to prominence through the Justice for Janitors campaign.

Huerta was recently arrested during immigrant rights protests in Los Angeles, spending three days in jail before being released on bond and charged with conspiracy to impede an officer.

He said it is too easy for government officials to “flip the narrative” on people who protest immigration arrests.

“We can’t let this sense of intimidation keep us from doing what we have to do,” Huerta said. “But we definitely have to be intelligent and smart about it, and we have to be really disciplined and always engaged in nonviolence.”

AIRR doesn’t want to dissuade people from getting involved as allies. It strives to empower immigrants, in particular.

All reported information is helpful, advocates said. For instance, AIRR has noted that more foreign cars are now being used in enforcement actions.

There are also instances of federal agents being seen driving around apartment complexes in Olathe in the early morning hours, and in neighborhoods in the Northeast section of Kansas City.

The assumption is that they might be searching for people to arrest on their way to work.

More than 2,400 people have been trained regionally in know-your-rights sessions. There are also guidelines on what to do if you believe you are witnessing a raid, including how to document it, while staying safe.

Local training sessions are similar to those made available by UnidosUS and other national organizations.

In the case of the Waldo worksite, a wrought iron fence separated the half-dozen people who tried to confront the U.S. Marshals Service.

One woman, who had come from a nearby gym, was very angry, said the man who photographed the incident.

He doesn’t regret his role. But he did worry that he might end up getting arrested as the tensions escalated.

Still, he felt an obligation to speak up as an African American, knowing that his community also had to fight for basic civil rights.

“I just felt like it’s happening right in front of my face now,” he said. “We might have kept those people from getting kidnapped.”

DHS announces plan for immigration detention center in Nebraska

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it will open a new migrant detention facility in Nebraska as part of President Trump’s efforts to bolster Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (Ice) detention network.

The facility, located in the south-western part of the state, has been called “Cornhusker Clink” by the department and will hold undocumented migrants arrested by Ice. The project is a partnership between the Nebraska department of correctional services and Ice, adding up to 280 new detention beds.

“Today, we’re announcing a new partnership with the state of Nebraska to expand detention bed space by 280 beds,” DHS secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

“Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country. If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska’s Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self-deport now using the CBP Home App.”

Officials are repurposing the state’s minimum-security prison work camp in McCook, about 210 miles west of Lincoln.

“This is about keeping Nebraskans – and Americans across our country – safe,” governor Jim Pillen said in a statement.

The Nebraska facility is the latest in a string of new detention centers opened under the Trump administration. DHS recently opened “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, launched a new site in El Paso, Texas, and plans to detain up to 1,000 migrants at Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer”.

Closing summary

Our live coverage is ending for the day, but we’ll be back on Wednesday. Thanks for reading along with us. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it will open a new migrant detention facility in Nebraska as part of President Trump’s ongoing efforts to bolster Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (Ice) detention network. The facility, located in the southwest part of the state, has been called “Cornhusker Clink” by the department and will hold undocumented migrants arrested by Ice. The project is a partnership between the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and Ice, adding up to 280 new detention beds.

National guard members from West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana began arriving in Washington on Tuesday, the Associated Press reports, to help with President Donald Trump’s federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. The Joint Task Force District of Columbia, the military unit overseeing the Guard, told the news wire that those troops will perform similar duties to local Guard members already on the streets. These tasks include protecting landmarks and crowd control.

The White House launched an official TikTok account, joining the social platform with more than 150 million US users. Reuters first reported the move. The first video posted by the White House on TikTok shows a video montage with a Trump voiceover saying: “Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation. I am your voice.” More here.

Texas Democrats are tearing up the “permission slips” they signed in order to leave the chamber, joining state representative Nicole Collier ahead of Wednesday’s vote on the controversial Texas congressional redistricting maps. The slips are part of new surveillance protocols set by Texas Republicans in the House chamber, stating that Democrats would “be granted written permission to leave only after agreeing to be released into the custody of a designated [Texas department of public safety] officer” who would ensure their return to the chamber.

National intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard said Tuesday she has stripped security clearances from 37 current and former national security officials, including some who worked on the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. In a memo posted on X, Gabbard accused the targeted individuals of having engaged in “politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified intelligence without authorization, and/or committing intentional egregious violations of tradecraft standards”.

Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into allegations that Washington DC police systematically manipulated crime statistics to make the city appear safer than it actually is. The probe, anonymous sources tell the Washington Post, NBC News and Fox News, being conducted by the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia under Jeanine Pirro, is the latest escalation between the Trump administration and DC officials over federal control of local policing. More here.

The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States. In an announcement, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants and that “reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that vetting”.

‘Boston will not back down’: mayor hits back at Trump officials’ sanctuary city threats

Boston’s mayor Michelle Wu has hit back sharply at the Trump administration’s legal threats over sanctuary city immigration policies, declaring that “Boston will not back down”.

Wu told a news conference outside Boston’s city hall on Tuesday: “The US attorney general asked for a response by today, so here it is: stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law. And Boston will not back down from who we are and what we stand for.”

Last week, the US Department of Justice sent letters to 13 states, from California to Rhode Island, and 22 local governments, from Boston to Seattle, that it has deemed “sanctuary jurisdictions”, threatening their leaders with prosecution for allegedly “undermining” and “obstructing” federal immigration enforcement.

The letters warned that they could lose federal funds or face legal action if they do not assist with Donald Trump’s sweeping, aggressive and highly controversial immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts.

Attorney general Pam Bondi has warned that she intends to prosecute political leaders who are not – in her view - sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement.

Bondi’s letter asked recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr lashed out at the American Academy of Pediatrics after it said that children ages 6 months to 23 months should receive a Covid-19 vaccine, in defiance of federal health officials.

In a post on the social media platform X, Kennedy accused the group of engaging in a “pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP’s Big Pharma benefactors.”

Kennedy posted donations from Covid mRNA vaccine drugmakers Pfizer, Moderna, Merck and Sanofi to the pediatricians’ Friends of Children Fund, which supports projects related to children’s health and health equity.

Kennedy argued that the donations constituted a conflict of interest because, according to him, they led to the recommendation that young children receive Covid vaccines.

Leading US economists urge peers to fight Trump’s attack on environment

Three leading US economists are urging their peers around the world to push back against Donald Trump’s attack on environmental laws.

In what amounts to a call to action to economists, the trio say rollback of environmental regulations is “inconsistent or antithetical” to fundamental principles of economics over how to allocate the world’s limited resources for the greatest possible value to society.

The economists, Catherine L Kling, Stephen Polasky, and Kathleen Segerson, say the Trump administration, by focusing on tearing down environmental protections, is likely to reduce rather than increase economic efficiency, and its policies are a threat to Americans and the rest of the world.

Writing in the journal Environmental and Resource Economics, they urge economists to challenge from an economic perspective the administration’s undermining of science on climate and the environment.

In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is “hurting” the housing industry “very badly” and said he should cut interest rates.

“Could somebody please inform Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can’t get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,” Trump wrote.

Trump has previously called on officials to seize control from Powell if he fails to cut interest rates. Earlier this month, Trump said he would remove Powell “in a heartbeat,” arguing that the Fed’s interest rate was too high, but added that others have said Powell’s removal would “disturb the market”.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Donald Trump has been testing a sound system at the Rose Garden for an upcoming party.

Leavitt reposted a video on the social platform X from White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino. The video shows the White House patio with God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood in the background, a song that Trump frequently played during his campaign rallies.

Leavitt quoted Trump saying the party “will be the best event in the history of the White House.”

The Rose Garden renovations are part of Trump’s plans to renovate the White House, including an enormous $200m ballroom for hosting official receptions, one of the biggest projects at the White House in more than a century.

The Guardian’s Oliver Laughland, Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Raima Amjad report on how Ice used Marriott hotels to detain immigrants, despite the chain’s 2019 pledge not to cooperate:

A Sheraton hotel in Louisiana has been used by immigration officials to hold people who are being deported, in what appears to be a contradiction of a position Sheraton’s parent company, Marriott, took in 2019 when it said its properties would not be used in cooperation with Ice.

The Intercept first reported that the hotel, located on MacArthur Drive in Alexandria, Louisiana, near a major deportation hub and airport used by Ice, had been used by immigration officials earlier this month to hold a father and his teenage son for four days after their arrest in New York. They were then deported to Ecuador. The Intercept cited phone-tracking evidence that had been shared with the publication and was later seen by the Guardian.

The evidence corroborates the account of a source with knowledge of hotel operations in Alexandria, who told the Guardian that they believed the venue had been used to detain immigrant families and unaccompanied children since it was renovated in late 2023. The source observed Ice contractors known to assist in the transfer of unaccompanied minors operating at the Sheraton as recently as June of this year.

The source added that other hotels in the area have also been used to hold immigrant families.

It is not clear whether Marriott has a formal contract with Ice or what the company knows about Ice’s use of the Sheraton in Alexandria. In one case that emerged last year, Marriott sued a New York-based franchise after the hotel entered a partnership with the city for it to be used as an immigrant shelter, saying it had done so without Marriott’s consent.

Secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem announced on Tuesday that the US-Mexico border wall will be painted black at the request of President Donald Trump as an effort to deter immigration into the United States.

Noem, speaking at a news conference at the border wall, said that painting the wall black “will make it even harder for people to climb.”

“Black gets hotter in this weather, and in this heat, and in this sun,” she said. “When you touch something that’s hot during these kinds of temperatures, it’s very difficult to climb it.”

She added that Trump “wants to make it as difficult as possible” for migrants to cross the southern border.

Mike Banks, chief of the US Border Patrol, echoed Noem’s reasons for painting the wall black.

“The black is going to protect the wall from rusting,” Banks said, “and it makes it more difficult to climb.”

The move is the latest step in Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown. During his second term, large sections of the border were designated as militarized zones, which allowed US troops to apprehend immigrants and others accused of trespassing on military bases. This shift also enabled additional criminal charges that could carry prison sentences.

The number of attempted illegal crossings has plummeted, according to data from the US Customs and Border Protection.

White House launches official TikTok account

The White House launched an official TikTok account on Tuesday, joining the social platform with more than 150 million US users. Reuters first reported the move.

“The Trump administration is committed to communicating the historic successes President Trump has delivered to the American people with as many audiences and platforms as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Reuters as the site went live.

The first video posted by the White House on TikTok shows a video montage with a Trump voiceover saying: “Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation. I am your voice.”

The video was posted at about 5:30pm ET. As I write this post, the account has about 1,400 followers.

Texas Democrats tear up 'permission slips' ahead of map vote

Texas Democrats are tearing up the “permission slips” they signed in order to leave the chamber, joining state representative Nicole Collier ahead of Wednesday’s vote on the controversial Texas congressional redistricting maps.

The slips are part of new surveillance protocols set by Texas Republicans in the House chamber, stating that Democrats would “be granted written permission to leave only after agreeing to be released into the custody of a designated [Texas department of public safety] officer” who would ensure their return to the chamber.

The move follows a two-week quorum break that had delayed Republicans’ effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts to align with Donald Trump’s push to reshape the US House map in his favor before the 2026 midterm elections.

On Tuesday, Collier chose to remain confined inside the Texas house chamber until lawmakers reconvene on Wednesday, refusing to comply with what she condemned as a “demeaning” protocol.

US to ‘root out anti-Americanism’ in reviewing immigration applications

The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States.

In an announcement, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants and that “reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that vetting”.

“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” said agency spokesperson Matthew Tragesser. “US Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible. Immigration benefits – including to live and work in the United States – remain a privilege, not a right.”

The US Immigration and Nationality Act, which dates back to 1952, defines anti-Americanism, which at the time primarily focused on communists.

UN rights experts and human rights groups have also argued that these removals to a nation that is not the migrant's place of origin could violate international law.","The US has reached bilateral deportation agreements with Honduras and Uganda as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration, according documents obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS.

Uganda has agreed to take an unclear number of African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum on the US-Mexico border, while Honduras will receive several hundred deported people from Spanish-speaking countries, CBS reports.

The move is part of an attempt by Donald Trump's administration to get more countries to accept deported migrants who are not their own citizens.

Human rights campaigners have condemned the policy, saying migrants face the risk of being sent to countries where they could be harmed.

Under the agreement, Uganda has agreed to accept deported migrants as long as they do not have criminal histories, but it's unclear how many the country would ultimately take, according to CBS.

Honduras agreed to receive migrants over two years, including families travelling with children, but documents suggest it could decide to accept more.

Both deals are part of the Trump administration's broader push for deportation arrangements with countries on several continents - including those with controversial human rights records.

So far, at least a dozen nations have agreed to accept deported migrants from other countries.

Last week, the US State Department announced it had signed a ""safe third country"" agreement with Paraguay to ""share the burden of managing illegal immigration"".

The White House has also been actively courting several African nations, with Rwanda saying earlier this month it will take up to 250 migrants from the US.

A condition of the deal specifies that Rwanda would have ""the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement"", a government spokesperson told the BBC.

Rwanda has previously been criticised for its human rights record, including the risk that those sent to the East African nation could be deported again to countries where they may face danger.

Earlier this year, Panama and Costa Rica agreed to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants from the US.

Government documents show the Trump administration has also approached countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive deported migrants, CBS reported.

Since the start of his second term, Trump has embarked on sweeping efforts to remove undocumented migrants - a key election promise that drew mass support during this campaign.

In June, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland without giving them the chance to raise the risks they might face.

At the time, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the majority ruling, calling the decision ""a gross abuse"".

This motion seeks immediate relief to prevent ongoing harm caused by the Trump-Vance administration’s new, unlawful policy that blocks Members of Congress from conducting critical congressional oversight.

At a time when the administration is detaining more individuals than ever before—over 58,000 people—and reports of mistreatment, overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and the detention of U.S. citizens are growing, the need for real-time, on-the-ground oversight has never been more urgent. This week’s filing is part of the Members of Congress’ broader legal effort to hold the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accountable for its flagrant defiance of federal law and constitutional order.

In addition to the above representatives, the plaintiffs include House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

“Today, we are filing a motion to immediately stop the Trump Vance administration from unlawfully blocking Members of Congress from accessing immigration detention facilities,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat. “This motion is about defending the legal right and constitutional duty of every Member of Congress to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people. If granted, the injunction will prevent this administration from obstructing lawful visits in the future. Oversight is not optional. It is a core function of our democracy and essential to ensuring accountability and protecting human rights.”

“Blocking Members of Congress from oversight visits to ICE facilities that house or otherwise detain immigrants violates federal law, and the Trump administration knows it. Congressional oversight is critical to preventing abuse, protecting human rights, and ensuring transparency. We’ll continue to stand up for the rule of law,” said Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse.

“The court order we seek is necessary so Congress can get back to conducting proper oversight of ICE. Unfortunately, the administration gave us no other choice. We need to be able to do the work our constituents elected us to do,” said Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson.

“Trump’s blockade of congressional oversight of America’s immigration detention facilities is illegal and dangerous. Today, we’re filing a motion for a court order to stop this brazen defiance of the law,” said House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin.

“If Donald Trump and Kristi Noem believe they can shut the doors on congressional oversight and operate their mass roundups and arrests without scrutiny from Congress or the American people, they are gravely mistaken. We’ll keep fighting in court until we are able to resume unannounced visits of ICE facilities as the law requires.”

“The law is clear: Members of Congress have the right to inspect conditions at ICE facilities. We are working to expose wrongdoing and uphold the law. ICE is breaking the law to hide the facts from the American people,” said House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia. “It’s time for the courts to end this illegal behavior, and let us do our jobs. We will have accountability.”

The congressional leaders are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

How did we get here?

Federal law (Sec. 527, FY2024 DHS Appropriations Act) allows Members of Congress to visit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sites where noncitizens are detained without prior notice. But increasingly, these representatives have been stopped at the door.

In response to questions about this, ICE officials announced a new policy requiring a seven-day waiting period and preventing entry to ICE field offices.

On July 30, a dozen individual Members of the U.S. House of Representatives sued the Trump–Vance administration, challenging the policy as an unlawful obstruction of congressional oversight.",https://hudsonvalleypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Adriano-Espaillat.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 08:56:22.990041

Mayor Adams should know that; his sanctuary policies enabled the shooting of a CBP officer in Manhattan by two illegal aliens just last month.
We encourage all sanctuary politicians to stop the chaos, join us, and side with the American people instead of criminal illegal aliens.""","New York City Mayor Eric Adams is siding with the city's 3 million immigrants, filing suit to stop the Trump administration's campaign of courthouse arrests.

He's calling for an immediate stop to the actions by ICE agents.

""These situations are tragic""

The steady stream of arrests - one day a 20-year-old high school student, another day a 6-year-old child and her mother - has the city filing a friend of the court brief to stop the practice once and for all.

""You can't snatch people off the courthouse steps anymore. That's wrong. Don't do it. And we're asking a court to say they can't do that anymore,"" First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro said.

Mastro said the city is simply fed up with the heavy handed actions of ICE agents arresting people who show up for court hearings.

Mastro was moved by pictures that show a sign reading ""Mom"" in pink glitter, along with a play kitchen and other toys, that were left behind by three members of an Ecuadorian family who left for a recent immigration hearing and never returned. Martha, a mother, and her 6-year-old daughter Dayra, were sent to an ICE detention center in Texas and feared deported.

""These situations are tragic,"" Mastro said.

""We have to allow people to go through the legal process""

The suit, filed as an amicus brief, or friend of the court, seeks an immediate halt to courthouse arrests by ICE, saying the practice has taken a ""heavy toll"" on a city where 3 million - 40% of the population - are immigrants.

""The sheer number of individuals detained is remarkable: in just a two-week period between late May and early June, federal officers arrested more than 130 people in a lower Manhattan immigration courthouse building,"" city officials wrote in the suit.

""We have to allow people to go through the legal process, and that's why we filed the amicus brief,"" Adams said.

""The 7-year-old and her mother have not committed any crimes. You know, the 7-year-old was gearing up to go back to school in a couple of weeks,"" said Murrad Awawdeh of the Immigration Coalition.

CBS News New York previously spoke to the child's brother, who said his sister is 6 years old and will turn 7 in October.

Awawdeh, the Immigration Coalition's president and CEO, is happy the city filed the suit, but he says the city and the mayor should be doing more.

""I want to see him say that the NYPD is not going to collude illegally with the Department of Homeland Security or ICE. I want to make sure that he's investing more resources into immigration and legal services. Additionally, making sure that's he's protecting our sanctuary policies,"" Awawdeh said.

""Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them. The ability of law enforcement to make arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense. It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be. It is also safer for our officers and the community. These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons,"" a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. ""Further, illegal aliens are NOT 'New Yorkers,' and trying to shield them from law enforcement poses a threat to the actual American citizens and legal residents of New York City. Mayor Adams should know that; his sanctuary policies enabled the shooting of a CBP officer in Manhattan by two illegal aliens just last month. This Administration is once again implementing the rule of law. We encourage all sanctuary politicians to stop the chaos, join us, and side with the American people instead of criminal illegal aliens.""

The city was not the only one to file suit. Attorney General Letitia James wants a judge to stop ICE from holding immigrants at their Lower Manhattan field office in what she claims are inhumane and unsanitary conditions.

Immigrants ""caught in a trap laid by immigration authorities""

""While the City does not set immigration policy or decide who enters this country, it must govern with an eye to the reality that asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants have made the City their home. The tactics employed against many of the individuals represented here— using their appearances at court for routine immigration hearings as opportunities to detain them—threaten to deter people from accessing the court system on which local governance depends. The implications threaten to reach well beyond the immigration arena and reach countless other matters affecting public welfare,"" New York City Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant wrote in the brief.

Goode-Trufant wrote that immigrants heading to court have been ""caught in a trap laid by immigration authorities"" which presents them ""with an impossible choice: risk detention by attending future court proceedings or run the same risk by not attending. To put it mildly, this undermines the public interest.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/28/853d2d36-15ac-4fbf-b9e5-ef2af16aeddc/thumbnail/1200x630/9ae53ddcdf92a99db11f608f3e232d3c/gettyimages-2220763955.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 02:57:11.184865

The International Association of Chiefs of Police, one of the nation's largest police organizations, has adopted two resolutions focused on immigration enforcement operations. One talks about the dangers of, quote, ""inflammatory rhetoric"" from influential leaders. The other warns that when agents cover their faces it can, quote, ""create confusion, fear and mistrust among community members and responding agencies."" It's rare for the organization to make this kind of a statement, and IACP deputy executive director Terrence Cunningham is with us now to explain the thinking behind it. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

TERRENCE CUNNINGHAM: Hi, Ari. Great to be on. Thank you.

SHAPIRO: Why did you think it was important to put these out now?

CUNNINGHAM: So we heard directly from our members - we're about 35,000 members - that they were really concerned, first about the face covering aspect of the first resolution, and then the - later, we also heard about the - you know, kind of the rise in the incendiary, you know, rhetoric that we're hearing out there, both from politicians and from, you know, community leaders and other folks in the public.

SHAPIRO: Well, let me ask specifically about the face coverings.

CUNNINGHAM: Yeah.

SHAPIRO: Immigration and Customs Enforcement says this is necessary to prevent doxing and assaults on officers. Do they have a point?

CUNNINGHAM: Clearly, we have seen a rise in doxing on officers - not just federal agents, but on local officers as well. But from our perspective - from an IACP perspective, we think this is a real slippery slope. You know, from a police legitimacy standpoint, the public needs to know who it is that they're interacting with, whether it's, you know, when you're looking at somebody and having a conversation with them, you can see empathy in their face. You can have a conversation, understand who that person is. You need to be able to identify that person should something happen. We feel strongly that the face coverings are inappropriate in most cases in policing in a democratic society in 2025.

SHAPIRO: You also, and I'm quoting here, ""urge public figures to communicate responsibly, especially given the amplifying effect of social media."" Can you give us an example of the kind of rhetoric you're concerned about?

CUNNINGHAM: I mean, there's - really, to be honest with you, I actually hearken back to 2016, where we saw the five Dallas officers were shot and killed.

SHAPIRO: But you're putting this out in 2025. There's a lot of...

CUNNINGHAM: Right.

SHAPIRO: ...Inflammatory rhetoric in 2025. Is this specifically...

CUNNINGHAM: Right.

SHAPIRO: ...About the kinds of things the president and his Cabinet members have said?

CUNNINGHAM: It's not just about the administration. It's about, you know, public officials. It's also about, you know, leaders in the community, and it's about the public in general. So I think it...

SHAPIRO: But of course, immigration enforcement is the top priority of this president and this administration. This president is very active on social media, is known for saying inflammatory things. Federal agents have been wearing face coverings. People could be forgiven for interpreting this to be a statement about the administration.

CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, and again, that's why I hearken back to it that it's actually not directly pointed at the administration. You know, we feel, from our perspective, that law enforcement officers are really facing unprecedented scrutiny and hostility in the streets. And we're starting to see attacks on officers again as a result.

SHAPIRO: Tell me about the concern that this will create confusion, fear and mistrust among community members. What are you worried about?

CUNNINGHAM: Well, again, I go back to - I look at just earlier this - late spring, early summer, when we saw the protests out there in LA. You saw the LAPD officers standing out there in uniform, their faces uncovered. Literally, their last names were on tape on their helmets so you could, you know, identify them easily. They had their badge numbers on. And when we see folks out there, whether they're federal agents or they're state or local officers, and they're wearing face coverings and they're not identifying themselves appropriately, one of the - our major concerns is blue-on-blue actions. You know, a police officer arriving on a scene because somebody calls and says they see a couple of people out there. I'm not sure exactly who they are. They have face masks on, and they're trying to force somebody into a car. And, you know, state or local officers show up, and whether it's a federal agent or a state or local agent that's not properly identifying themselves, you always worry about those type of incidents there.

And also, to be quite honest with you, Ari, you've - we've seen recently where there have been robberies, there's been rapes, there's been, you know, attempted kidnappings as a result of people impersonating both federal agents, you know, and specifically, really, federal agents, with masks on.

SHAPIRO: Does the timing of this have anything to do with the federal takeover of D.C. police?

CUNNINGHAM: No, it didn't. As a matter of fact, the resolutions came out prior to the expansion of federal agents and National Guard in D.C.

SHAPIRO: Terrence Cunningham is the deputy executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Thank you very much.

CUNNINGHAM: Thanks, Ari. Appreciate it.

Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, was arrested by ICE officials on July 25, as part of the agency's effort to step up immigration enforcement.

Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative said Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans' case.

Evans' arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment.

Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department's E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

Officials with Old Orchard Beach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE's detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy.

It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm. WMTW-TV reported Monday that Evans' agreement to a voluntary departure means he will be allowed to leave the U.S. at his own expense to avoid being deported.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/18/19/US_Immigration_Police_Officer_Arrest_76477.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-08-20 02:57:19.949048

LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) is moving to dismiss the federal charges against her by invoking President Donald Trump’s mass pardons for those who attacked the Capitol in his name on Jan. 6, 2021.

A grand jury indicted McIver in June on a three-count charge of “forcibly impeding” officers during a chaotic confrontation between federal agents and elected officials outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Newark earlier this year. The charge is a felony, and the three counts carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison.

McIver, the first sitting member of Congress to be criminally prosecuted by the Trump administration, pleaded not guilty.

In new filings late last week, McIver asked a court to dismiss the charge because, she argues, she is being selectively and vindictively prosecuted by the government and because she cannot be charged for official acts.

McIver said that the DOJ is demonstrating “unconstitutional differential treatment” by pursuing charges against her after dropping cases against over 160 other defendants facing the same crime for their actions during the Jan. 6 attack.

“There is a simple difference between this prosecution of Congresswoman McIver and the 160 cases involving assault against federal officers on January 6 that the Justice Department has dismissed: it is all about politics and partisanship,” one of her dismissal motions reads.

In the filing, McIver noted numerous instances of Trump administration officials speaking fondly of Jan. 6 Capitol rioters and contrasted those statements with how Trump officials have characterized McIver’s actions.

DHS officials have asserted that her attempt to tour Delaney Hall, the ICE facility, was “just another case of Democratic lawmakers labeling political stunts as oversight while they endanger the safety of ICE personnel.” Trump himself praised the DOJ for bringing charges against McIver, claiming that it indicated that the “the days of woke are over.”

“Unlike the January 6 rioters, Congresswoman McIver had every right to be on those premises. Indeed, she was there to do her job,” the dismissal motion reads.

In a separate motion, McIver said the charges must also be dropped because she could not be charged for expressing her constitutional authority to conduct oversight on the executive branch.

In doing so, the representative cited the Speech and Debate Clause, which shields lawmakers from legal proceedings for their legislative acts, and the absolute immunity the Supreme Court granted to presidents for their official acts in U.S. v. Trump.

Since the president has immunity for official acts, the “separation of powers accordingly confers an immunity on the official acts of legislators symmetrical with the immunity for the President’s official acts,” McIver’s lawyers argued.

“Congresswoman McIver’s conduct here undoubtedly consisted of official acts entitled to presumptive immunity, which the Government cannot rebut,” McIver’s second dismissal motion reads.

McIver attempted to tour Delaney Hall as part of a congressional delegation with her fellow New Jersey Democratic members of Congress, Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez.

Federal law allows members of Congress to conduct oversight on any facility operated by the Department of Homeland Security and its sub-agencies, including ICE. McIver, Watson Coleman and Menendez repeatedly described the visit, in advance, as congressional oversight inspection.

However, the oversight visit erupted into chaos after federal agents attempted to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) for allegedly trespassing while the lawmakers were inside the facility. (The trespassing charges against Baraka have been dismissed and the mayor is suing over his arrest.)

Though not a member of Congress, Baraka attempted to join McIver and the other lawmakers on their oversight tour. Federal agents initially permitted him to enter the facility but then arrested him after he left the facility in response to orders to do so.

Body-camera footage from federal agents that McIver’s team received in discovery indicated that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the No. 2 official at the DOJ, personally directed Baraka’s arrest.

In the footage, Ricky Patel, a DHS investigations official who coordinated Baraka’s arrest, is heard saying: “I am arresting the mayor . . . even though he stepped out, I am going to put him in cuffs . . . per the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.”’

McIver’s attorneys alleged that DHS agents and senior DOJ officials “concocted a scheme to arrest the Mayor of Newark on fabricated, petty-misdemeanor trespassing charges that further delayed the Members’ inspection.”

The contact she made with officers did not amount to assault but was largely the result of a “torrent of jostling” throughout a chaotic scrum that developed as federal agents were attempting to arrest Baraka, her lawyers argued. They noted that during the scrum, a federal agent “forcefully” shoved McIver.

“The agent’s use of force against Congresswoman McIver as she was reentering the facility was so egregious that—unlike the officers responding to the Congresswoman’s actions—she immediately informed an ICE official that she intended to file a complaint.”

In addition to the two motions to dismiss, McIver filed a motion to obtain body camera footage from the officer who shoved her and the officer she allegedly assaulted — two pieces of evidence that the government refused to provide in her initial discovery request.

McIver’s attorneys also asked a court to order the Trump administration to delete several social media posts that contain extrajudicial statements that, they argue, harm her ability to have a fair trial.

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.
Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border.
""The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,"" she said.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that the entire wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is going to be painted black to make it hotter and deter illegal immigration — an idea she said was ""specifically at the request"" of President Trump.

Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.

She touted the height of the wall as well as its depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.

""That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb. So we are going to be painting the entire southern border wall black to make sure that we encourage individuals to not come into our country illegally,"" Noem said.

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.

During Mr. Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy, though construction on the wall faced some legal and logistical delays. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress in the Trump-backed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" this summer.

The Trump administration has sought to fortify the southern border in other ways, too. Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border. Crossing into those territories is considered entering a military base, allowing them to be detained by both Border Patrol and the Defense Department, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier this year.

Noem said the federal government has been building about a half mile of barrier every day.

""The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,"" she said.

But it is the law working, and the court system working, and the rule of law working, exactly as it's supposed to.

Below, please find a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.

LAW DORK: The people are starting to come in. We are very lucky to have some time to chat with California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who is here with us today and is one of the roughly half of the attorneys general across the country who are of The democratic persuasion and have been extremely busy with litigation, and as we're going to talk about pre-litigation investigations, strategizing and just probably a lot of looking ahead and figuring out what you need to be prepared for going going down the path. And I think just to to start off, I wanted to raise the fact that just just yesterday, as as we were nailing down everything on the specifics of this, and I started looking into what I wanted to talk with you about, as is often the case these days, whatever had happened over the weekend that I was initially planning on leading off with, decided that you all were filing a new lawsuit, and so I wanted to talk with you about that. This is, which is now fitting, and I'm sure you'll want to talk about, more of a pattern with this administration of taking long standing federal grants and sort of trying to change the way that they're operating to the advantage of their political aims. And this was specifically DOJ is Victims of Crime Act grants. What? What happened that that led to this litigation?

ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA: First of all, Chris, thanks for having me. I'm honored to be with you. The lawsuit that you're referencing is our 39th lawsuit in 30 weeks. We brought more than one lawsuit a week, because that's how blatantly and brazenly, consistently and frequently the Trump administration has been violating the law. Our goal is to never sue him, because that would mean he's complying with the law and the Constitution, but we will be non-negotiable in bringing him to court, taking him to court if and when he breaks the law and violates the Constitution and he did it again that led to the basis of our lawsuit that we filed yesterday, challenging the unlawful conditions put on the Victims of Crime Act funding, which is funding that was put in place 45 years ago under President Ronald Reagan, when there was a finding at the national level, federal level, based on investigation and research and study that we're not we were not doing enough for the victims of crime in the United States. And so about a billion dollars a year goes out to states, over 100 million to California alone, to help victims of crime, people who have been the victims of domestic violence or sexual assault or gun violence, who are on the journey to heal and who need counseling and trauma informed care, who need shelter or food or clothing, who some need to pay for funeral or burial expenses, and Trump put an unlawful condition requiring states to participate in immigration enforcement against their 10th Amendment rights, and in violation of the separation of powers, this is not a condition that Congress put on the funding. It is him being anti-victim, turning his back on victims, on people who have suffered the most horrendous, painful, tragic experience they'll ever experience in their lives, something that most of us can't even imagine, and the funding that is provided to them, he is threatening to withhold treating them as political pawns in this game he has. He did the same thing with the brave men and women who serve in the Marines and in the National Guard, deploying them as his personal army on American soil, inappropriately. We took him to court yesterday, 21 different attorneys general, all Democratic, by the way, not one single Republican attorney general lifting a finger to stand up for the victims in their state, instead cowering in the corner, being craven and feckless and hoping, I think, secretly, drafting behind our work so that we can be successful and their victims can get services, but they will not stand up to Donald Trump. Instead, they are bending the knee. But we brought this lawsuit in the District of Rhode Island yesterday, and this is about attorneys general standing up for the rule of law, standing up for victims, and standing up for democracy.

LAW DORK: I think that leads me to — you sort of highlighted this idea of the split between the Democratic and Republican AGs, which is both surprising and not, depending on how you look at it. It is sort of remarkable that some of these actions that like certainly, if a Democratic presidential administration took the action, they would be all over it. But, but also just generally, some of these cuts have been traumatic to state interests, to these precious states' rights that we've heard about for so long, to local control. But then you said at the end, this idea that they are hoping to get the benefit from that. Can you talk about how that is playing out? What do you mean by that? I think both of us know what that means. How is that actually playinh out?

BONTA: Sure, you know, earlier this year, before a major Supreme Court decision which changed the law on this issue, Democratic attorneys general were able to go to court and seek relief when the Constitution was violated or laws broken, and we would often get universal injunctions, meaning the action of the federal administration was blocked, and it was blocked nationwide, in all instances. And Republican states would benefit from the action and work of Democratic attorneys general, even though they never showed up, didn't lift a finger, didn't go to court. There was a recent case that arose out of our birthright citizenship case, where we challenged an executive order that tried to strip away a constitutional right that is right there in the 14th Amendment in the citizenship clause — the idea that if you're born on American soil, you're a US citizen. And that case went up to the US Supreme Court, not on the substantive issue of whether birthright citizenship is a constitutional right, but on the issue of whether universal injunctions are things that courts can provide as a remedy, and they they said no. They said that the parties who go to court can get relief. They can get complete relief, and sometimes that could be a nationwide injunction under certain circumstances, but generally, if you don't go to court now, you don't get relief. And so I had always thought that on all of our cases, up to that point, the Republican attorneys general were secretly cheering us on and hoping we'd be successful so they didn't have to publicly oppose Trump but would still benefit from us blocking the withholding of funding or the stripping away of rights for the people in their states, but now they can't. They're going to have to do their job or else answer to their constituents, and when their constituents ask them, ""Why are you letting my constitutional rights be stripped away? Why are you letting critical funding for Medicaid or food or childcare or college programs or housing be taken away from me?"" They're gonna have to answer, and they're not going to have good answers, and so their cowardice and their cravenness will be fully exposed.

LAW DORK: And that was that was certainly clear early on when it came to the funding cases — that we saw in these funding cases — that they clearly were wanting the advantage of that, they didn't want to have their funding cut, and yet they weren't needing to bring the litigation at all.

BONTA: That's right. And you know, the second case we brought early on in the Trump administration was a challenge to an Office of Management and Budget memo that sought to withhold $3 trillion nationwide to all states, about $168 billion to California alone. And we worked through the night, after we caught wind of that memo late in the evening and filed a complaint the next morning, and were able to block it as an unlawful attempt to violate the separation of powers and infringe upon Congress's authority to appropriate funding and to have the power of the purse. And the red states benefited from that, although they did nothing.

LAW DORK: You mentioned the birthright citizenship case. Now that was obviously, as you said, that the case that the underlying case that led to this change in universal injunctions. But in that case, as you alluded to, the states that had brought the litigation had done something a little different, and had said that in order to get complete relief, you needed a nationwide injunction because people have the right to travel and so Californians are going to give birth in states that might not be subject to this litigation, and people are going to move into California, and you're going to end up having a completely unworkable patchwork of who is a citizen and who is not, who is subject to this order and who is not. And I just want to read, after this Supreme Court decision came out, you went back to court and defended the nationwide injunction and the judge in your case said, ""For the foregoing reasons, no workable, narrower alternative to the injunction issued originally would provide complete relief to the plaintiffs in this case. The court therefore declines to modify that injunction."" And I just wanted to talk with you a little bit about like, when we got that ruling in June, there was a lot of anger and upsettedness at what the court did, certainly on the nationwide injunction, but a lot of people thought that this meant that the birthright citizenship order was going to go into effect, and here we are, almost a month after the deadline that the court set for when the order was supposed to go into effect. And there are, by my count, four court orders that are limiting it. There's yours, there's the other multistate litigation, and then there are two class action injunctions that are in place. And it seems to me that this time, the Trump Administration Department of Justice is going a lot more slowly. They're not rushing back to the Supreme Court. What's your thought on, sort of where these challenges to this executive order stand, and what you think, if not Trump himself, what the Justice Department is thinking about the next steps in this,

BONTA: I think the United States Department of Justice is doing everything they can to not get the substantive issue of whether birthright citizenship is a constitutional right before any court. They specifically avoided that and did mental gymnastics to avoid it front of the US Supreme Court so only the issue of universal injunctions and relief for the parties before the court was at issue. Every court has that has decided the substantive issue and taken a peek at the merits by issuing injunctions has found what is clear and obvious in the plain and unambiguous text of the US Constitution, in the US Supreme Court interpretation of the citizenship clause — that if you're born on American soil, you're a US citizen, period, full stop. And this is Trump's day one action. He literally got sworn in and inaugurated and lifted up his right hand and swore to defend and uphold the US Constitution, and then later that day put his name onto an executive order that violated the US Constitution. That all the courts have found the same thing and issued injunctions shows what we have always known to be true: This is a no-brainer. This one is black and white. This is clear. Birthright citizenship is a US constitutional right. Period, full stop, end of story. And the US DOJ has taken a lot of L's here, they're going to court and losing a lot. Out of 21 temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions that that we have sought and that a court has ruled on, we've won 19 times. We're winning over 90% of the time. They will lose on this case. I think they know that, so they're trying to delay, drag their feet, avoid judgment day. But Judgment Day is coming, and the Constitutional right of birthright citizenship is a US constitutional right, and courts will affirm that.

LAW DORK: There have been, obviously, so many directions and cases that you've had to go in over over the past six months. You mentioned your success rate. And as much as I'd love to only talk about the successes, I do want to talk about sort of the first big loss that we got from the Supreme Court in these challenges, and that was the case over the mass-cancelation of education department grants, and that that 5-4 decision that was sort of on the shadow docket that got the dissent talking about how we thought the court wasn't supposed to make decisions affecting the merits on such threadbare assertions with no oral arguments. Of course, we later learned that was going to become sort of the conservative majority's best way of giving Trump wins, because they know that further examination would be not as successful. That case, and certainly you've gone forward with other funding challenges since, what happened there in in that Department of Education v. California case, and how have you responded to that case, where the Court said that the challenge, basically, it was a contract case and so therefore it should have been brought under another law called the Tucker Act, and therefore brought in the Court of Federal Claims instead of the way you were bringing it. How has that changed your litigation strategy and what effect has that had?

BONTA: Well, first, I'll say that most of our cases will never get to the US Supreme Court, as most don't. Most cases are decided by federal trial courts, and some may get to an appeal, but most will not get to the US Supreme Court. Critical ones do, of course, and we are well aware that the US Supreme Court not might not see all of our cases the way we see them, and we might get some setbacks, as we had in this case. But what I think the US Supreme Court decision here points out is that there are different procedural pathways to seek relief, and we believe that we were pursuing the right one by going to federal district court. The US Supreme Court disagreed. They thought we needed to go to the Court of Federal Claims, a specialty court, if you will, under a specific act, the Tucker Act, and that's not a substantive loss. That is a procedural shunt, pushing us to another court under another statute, where our merits arguments are still live. And something similar happened in our tariff case that Governor Newsom and I brought, where we brought the case in the Northern District of California, we believe that's the appropriate venue. And the judge there said you should go to the Court of International Trade where, according to that judge, these types of issues are properly brought. And so we live to fight another day. While we disagree and we preserve our rights to disagree, and we will continue to press that we were in the right venue, those aren't substantive losses. Those are just procedural setbacks, and we can pursue the same or similar arguments in a different court, consistent with the appellate court's decision, under a different statute.

LAW DORK: A lot of — unsurprising at this point to anybody who's listening and watching this — a lot of Trump's actions come down to bullying, whether it's against large groups of people, whether it's against individuals who he believes have wronged him, whether it's against businesses. As California's Attorney General, I wanted to just talk with you a minute about one of the areas that has really got my attention, and that's his attack on law firms and lawyers. I know that that you all have gotten involved in some of those cases, the AGs, and you specifically, and I just wanted to ask you — outside of the legal arguments, which obviously have, I mean, for people who don't know, have lost in in every challenge, every law firm that has challenged these orders, judges appointed by presidents of both parties. When you saw those orders, when you saw the Perkins Coie order, when you saw the ones that have followed, what did you as the AG of California, think about that and think about what that means for being an AG, being the top law enforcement officer of a state.

BONTA: It meant to me that you have to fight, that you will only be bullied if you allow yourself to be bullied, and if your rights are violated, they must be vindicated, and you go to court to vindicate those rights. The law firms that you're talking about are attorneys who fight every day for their clients, yet they wouldn't fight for themselves? Instead, they ran to the White House to cut a deal after their rights were violated? No, no, you have to fight. And so big support for Perkins, Coie and my former law firm of Keker and Van Nest, who wrote this great op-ed encouraging other law firms to fight, and saying, ""If we're not going to fight, who will,"" and that's the spirit. And I think the folks who capitulated and acquiesced, they may have buyer's remorse on that, as they've seen others fight and win. But it is the law working, and the court system working, and the rule of law working, exactly as it's supposed to. If your rights are violent, you go to court, you make your case, you argue the law, and you present the facts, and you win. And so I'm grateful for the law firms who are fighting, others who are fighting. It's time to fight and stand up for our rights. Bullying, what I call Trump's soft power — intimidation, scaring people, making them think they have to take a risk, fooling them that they are breaking the law. For example, when you know when they he calls Diversity Equity and Inclusion programs discriminatory when they're the programs that tackle discrimination, they're not discrimination themselves. But folks, they're not sure, and they're frozen, and they worry, and it's scary to have the federal government going after you. I get that, but we've tried to give them support. We've provided guidance saying DEI does not violate the law — diversity, equity and inclusion — and, and I've heard from many people who said, ""That's helpful to us, that helps us understand our rights and reminds us what we knew, but what was cast into doubt — that we're not violating the law and we're doing the right thing."" So it's time to fight and step up, and AGs are doing that. I'm proud to be part of a group of 23 attorneys general going to court, going to the mat, not allowing Trump to violate the law and trespass on the Constitution, and we got a full tank of gas, tons of energy, 39 lawsuits in in 30 [weeks], and we're ready for more.

LAW DORK: I'm in DC. I'm literally here, blocks away from our own National Guard engagement here. Where do things stand? After, after trial in, in your case based on the deployment of National Guard to LA. Obviously different laws are involved, but I know that you just finished your trial, we had a court case filed by the DC AG on Friday when AG Bondi overstepped on her part. Where do things stand with your with your trial? Even when I mention the DC case, people immediately go to ask like, ""So how does this relate to what's going on in California?""

BONTA: We finished a trial last week in the Northern District of California, a three-day trial in front of Judge Breyer on the issue of whether the 4,000 deployed National Guardspeople and 700 Marines in LA were violating the Posse Comitatus Act, meaning that they were military involved in civilian law enforcement, and we believe we made a really strong case. I'm proud of my team. They presented a strong legal argument, strong facts, right? Words and testimony right out of the mouth of military leaders, including Major General Sherman, who acknowledged through their testimony that the military on the ground was involved in civilian law enforcement in different forms — in perimeter support, in blockades, in traffic enforcement, in immigration enforcement. The military were embedded with ICE on immigration enforcement operations 75% of the time in the weeks after their deployment. Oftentimes, when they assessed the operation before they executed it, they determined that there was little to no risk and there was no need to have to protect the personnel. We have really dramatic photos of military blocking and stopping the free movement of Americans, either pedestrians or motorists. So we are hopeful and optimistic and confident in the court order that will come. We went into the case feeling confident about what the evidence will show. All the evidence has been submitted and arguments made, we remain confident, and we believe that Judge Breyer will issue an order in the coming days that says that the President, with the deployment of the military in LA, violated the Posse Comitatus Act. And DC is no less disturbing. LA was first, but DC shows it wasn't last, and that there will be more potential deployments of military in American cities on American soil. DC has some unique laws there, and the Commander in Chief of the National Guard is the president under the law of DC, and is a local rule law. But it's no less disturbing and very problematic. And Trump has also suggested that he would be deploying more troops in Chicago and in Oakland and other places — all of which, by the way, are deep blue, Democratic cities and that is completely intentional on his part.

LAW DORK: And also, there was a news story that highlighted the fact in its image used that they were all cities led by Black mayors —

BONTA: Yes.

LAW DORK: — which I'm sure was not accidental, given Trump's proclivities. While I have you, I think a lot of people are paying really close attention to what's going on in Texas with redistricting, and what Governor Newsom is talking about doing in California. What is your role in that and what do you have to say about those questions and where we should be watching for you as and if that proceeds?

BONTA: My formal role as California Attorney General will be to defend against any lawsuits that may come if the legislature and the governor put a proposition on the ballot and it's challenged. We actually got a lawsuit filed today, which has been referred to us by a client agency. We will also write the title and summary for a proposition if a proposition is passed by the legislature and is to be put on the ballot. And I will say that Governor Newsom is fighting and fighting hard. He is leading this effort. He is working with the legislature. They are the ones who will put any proposition on the ballot. But it's important to note here that Trump started this when he reached out to Governor Abbott, looking for five districts that he needed — just like he called the Secretary of State in Georgia after 2020 looking for 11,000 votes. So, Trump started this, and Governor Abbott started this, and Texas started this, and Republicans started this, and California is trying to end this — and trying to block this abuse of power, this attempt to rig the outcome of the midterms when they see what's coming that the midterms are going to be something that favors the Democrats. And the proposition, as Governor Newsom has described it, has a trigger in it, where the five districts in California that he is considering adding through the maps only go into place if Texas or another red state manipulates their map. So it's an attempt to blunt and neutralize that effort. It's defense and response. It also moves us back to our independent redistricting commission in 2030 after the next Census, and most importantly, it goes directly to the people and lets them decide. It's not legislators in some smoky back room appearing with these maps and saying, ""here they are,"" but they are going to go through a transparent process and be put in front of the voters of California to decide. So I think a lawful, principled approach that Governor Newsom is supporting, and he's asking the legislature to support that will be put in front of the voters and then an important response to this attempt to rig the midterm elections by the Republicans and by Trump.

LAW DORK: We could go on forever. Trump this week raised this issue about mail-in voting and election machines. You've got these questions over these outstanding subpoenas challenging provision of gender-affirming care for transgender minors. DOGE lawsuits are still out there. Just yesterday, a federal judge granted class certification to figure out, finally, if Elon Musk was the de facto head of DOGE. You've got this violence at the CDC, the shooting at the CDC. When you're looking at sort of the multi-level attacks on the rule of law, on norms, on governmental systems, on the elections. What is your biggest concern as we're looking forward, and what should people be looking to do themselves to support the rule of law?

BONTA: Our North Star when we get involved is the rule of law — is the law violated, and that's when we sue. And so we don't choose our cases. They choose themselves based on if the law has been violated or the Constitution trampled on, and the case is ripe and California has been hurt, then then we sue. But, you know, the President of the United States is probably the most powerful person in the world with their actual given official power that they do have, but he regularly attempts to grasp and seize power that he does not have. He wants Congress's power, the power of the purse, the power to appropriate. He wants the state's power. He wants to tell us how to run our elections and how to provide health care and how to deploy our limited law enforcement resources. He questions judges and doesn't like courts that interpret the law in a way that's not the way he would like based on the outcome. And so it's this trespassing on the Constitution, this undermining of the Constitution, that is most disturbing — and that it's so consistent and so brazen. He keeps doing the same thing over and over again. He's a repeat offender. He keeps trying to exercise the power of the purse when Congress has that power, not him. He keeps trying to trample upon states' rights when he can't. And it's high volume, high speed, it's flood the zone. And so it's important for everyone to push back in every way possible. And the 3 Cs are really important right now — the courts, crowds and courage. Courts, crowds and courage. Courts are where we're going to seek relief. We're getting it regularly, as I mentioned. Winning, often. Protecting $168 billion of funding that Trump illegally tried to withhold from California. We need people to show up and show out when it's time, as consistently and often as we can, whether it be, No Kings or Hands Off. But people power is the most potent power that there is, and we need to demonstrate it.

LAW DORK: I think we saw that in DC this past week, when, as soon as there were efforts to sort of set up checkpoints that were clearly unconstitutional, people showed up right away — and eventually the law enforcement were just like, ""This is going to be pointless,"" because we learned that people had actually gone up the street with signs telling people to avoid that road. It was just a perfect example of that, that crowd part.

BONTA: And it's contagious and it's inspiring and it gives other people hope and gives other people courage. Courage is just so important. Fight for your rights. Don't let yourself be bullied. Don't let your rights be trampled on. Stand up, push back. Defend the Constitution, defend the rule of law, defend the future of this most incredible nation in the history of the world. It's worth fighting for. Every generation must fight for it. It's time to fight, and everyone has power, so don't be hopeless because we're not helpless. We all have the agency and the ability and the power to fight back. And if we all do it together, it'll be a reminder that the bosses of Trump are not his billionaire buddies or greedy corporations. It's you and me and us, the people. A government of, for, and by the people. We are the boss of Donald Trump and the people in government, not the other way around.

LAW DORK: Well, we will see, as the litigation continues, and certainly as the Supreme Court gets back into session, but I really appreciate you taking the time today, and I'm sure we will be seeing each other soon enough.

BONTA: Thanks, Chris, thanks for having me. And to everyone watching, thanks for joining. Stay enraged. Stay engaged. Keep fighting.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ASA0!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F171403601%2Fa2de2812-d00c-41e9-933a-ea407dccacd1%2Ftranscoded-00001.png",N,,2025-08-20 01:56:42.143813

It was the latest move in an escalating national battle over redistricting that began this summer when President Trump asked Texas leaders to help Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives by reshaping congressional districts and delivering five additional seats for their party.

California Democrats responded on Monday by introducing a package of bills to create new district boundaries that could help Democrats flip five seats in their state. Democratic state lawmakers, who control more than two-thirds of the California Legislature, plan to pass the bills on Thursday and put the proposal before voters in a Nov. 4 special election.

The emergency petition, filed by four Republican state legislators, argues that the State Constitution prohibits the Legislature from acting on the redistricting bills until Sept. 18 because new legislation requires a 30-day review period. The lawmakers said that more time was needed for the public to review the proposal, which would change the way some Asian American and Hispanic communities are represented.

States normally draw their congressional districts once a decade based on new census data, and the maps in California and Texas were initially created to last through the 2030 election cycle. But President Trump’s request of Texas Republicans has prompted Democratic leaders to counter with their own mid-decade redistricting pursuit.

California, the nation’s most populous state, was an obvious place to start, given that it has the most congressional seats and is reliably Democratic. But the state has more barriers to redrawing maps because its Constitution requires that an independent redistricting commission create congressional boundaries, and voters must approve any changes to that process.

“Instead of a monthslong transparent and participatory process overseen by an independent citizens redistricting commission for such a sensitive matter,” the lawsuit states, “the public would be presented instead with an up-or-down vote on maps unilaterally prepared in secret by the Legislature.”

At issue is a technical question of whether a bill is “introduced” at the time it is first assigned a bill number and drafted with preliminary language, or whether it must be fleshed out in full to begin the 30-day clock in the State Constitution. The state’s Constitution also has a rule that requires the final text of a bill be published for 72 hours before lawmakers can vote on it.

In the final weeks of the legislative session, California lawmakers for decades have rewritten bills, top to bottom, in a process colloquially referred to as “gut and amend.”

The 72-hour rule is a more recent requirement, intended to ensure that such last-minute bills receive at least three days of review. To adhere to that rule, the full Assembly and Senate are waiting until Thursday to vote on the redistricting bills that were introduced on Monday.

Democrats cannot afford to wait beyond this week because of the preparation time that elections officials need for a special election in November.

The lawsuit filed on Monday may be the first of multiple legal challenges. The National Republican Congressional Committee said last week that it was also preparing to pursue litigation against the Democratic plan in California.

The new facility, located in the southwest part of the state, was dubbed “Cornhusker Clink” and will house “criminal illegal aliens” arrested by ICE, DHS said in a press release. The detention center came as a result of a partnership between the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and ICE, expanding the capacity by up to 280 beds.

The officials are using the existing minimum security prison work camp in McCook, located around 210 miles west of Lincoln.

“Today, we’re announcing a new partnership with the state of Nebraska to expand detention bed space by 280 beds,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country. If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska’s Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self-deport now using the CBP Home App.”

The administration has continued adding detention buildings nationwide to help hold migrants whom agencies have arrested. DHS opened “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades last month and an East Montana detention facility in El Paso, Texas, this week. DHS will also hold up to 1,000 migrants in a “Speedway Slammer” detention facility in Indiana.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced Tuesday that the Nebraska National Guard will provide “administrative and logistical” support to ICE officials based in Nebraska to help enforce immigration laws. About 20 Army National Guard soldiers will be a part of the mission, with training beginning next week, according to DHS.

“I am also proud that the Nebraska State Patrol and National Guard will be assisting ICE enforcement efforts, as well,” Pillen said in a statement. “Homeland security starts at home, and, just as when I twice deployed troops to secure our southern border during the failed Biden administration, Nebraska will continue to do its part.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/hill_nation_summit_071625gn082-e1752677864106.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-19 22:56:40.739170

She asked them to report back to her by Aug. 19 on their plans to comply with federal laws that bar harboring illegal immigrants, or face investigations and possibly prosecutions.
“I am prepared to defend any litigation the Trump administration wishes to pursue,” he said.
The governor said he was confident Washington’s sanctuary law would withstand a court challenge.
The lawsuits allege sanctuary laws violate a federal law that requires local law officers to give federal agents information regarding a suspect’s immigration status.","OLYMPIA — Washington will fight the Trump administration’s crackdown on states that refuse to help federal agents enforce immigration laws, Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

Speaking at a press conference Aug. 19 in Olympia, Ferguson said he won’t yield to Attorney General Pam Bondi’s demand that states start eliminating sanctuary laws.

“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington bend the knee to a Trump administration that day by day drags us closer to authoritarianism,” he said.

Bondi sent letters Aug. 14 to governors of 13 states, including Washington, Oregon and California, and the mayors of 18 cities, including Portland and Seattle. She asked them to report back to her by Aug. 19 on their plans to comply with federal laws that bar harboring illegal immigrants, or face investigations and possibly prosecutions.

“Any sanctuary jurisdiction that continues to put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens can either come to the table or see us in court,” Bondi said in a social media post.

Ferguson said Bondi would see Washington in court.

“I am prepared to defend any litigation the Trump administration wishes to pursue,” he said.

The governor said he was confident Washington’s sanctuary law would withstand a court challenge. The law, titled The Keep Washington Working Act, was passed in 2019. One of its purported benefits is to help agriculture.

The USDA estimates more than 40% of farmworkers are in the country illegally. President Trump has said he wants to ensure farms can keep valued workers, but his administration has not yet provided a path for undocumented farmworkers to gain legal status.

With the exception of cannabis farms in California, Immigration and Custom Enforcement seems to be staying away from farms, National Council of Agricultural Employers President and CEO Michael Marsh said.

“There seems to be an effort by the administration to not necessarily prioritize the deportations of farmworkers from their worksites, farms. And that’s welcome,” he said.

ICE has not targeted Washington farms, said Enrique Gastelum, CEO of the Worker and Farmer Labor Association, a Lacey, Wash.-based organization that recruits foreign farmworkers.

“We still haven’t seen the workplace raids — knock on wood,” he said. “I don’t want us to go through what we’re seeing in California.”

Growers tell him local farmworkers are “still coming out in force,” Gastelum said. “I do think we have enough people for this year.”

Sanctuary laws, including Washington’s, typically forbid local officers from detaining illegal immigrants, or turning them over to federal agents.

“We’re not going to change that law and weaken it in response to these threats. That’s not going to happen,” Ferguson said.

The Trump administration has sued sanctuary states Colorado, Illinois and New York, as well as sanctuary cities Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City.

The lawsuits allege sanctuary laws violate a federal law that requires local law officers to give federal agents information regarding a suspect’s immigration status.

Most lawsuits are unresolved, but U.S. District Judge Lindsay Jenkins in July dismissed the lawsuit against Illinois and Chicago.

While local law enforcement officers must give information regarding the immigration status of people in custody, they do not have to be more helpful to federal agents, Jenkins ruled.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/08/Gov.-Bob-Ferguson-copy.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 23:56:25.402408

This means driving by ICE agents while loudly denouncing them on megaphones.
In Gochez’s experience, such actions have resulted in quick retreats of ICE agents, especially when agents are outnumbered.
Of the nearly 1 million undocumented people estimated to be living in LA County, ICE agents have arrested almost 3,000.
In Gochez’s view, these numbers are a testament to the successful attempts by members of the Community Self-Defense Coalition to force ICE agents to retreat.","What do you do when a family member is kidnapped by masked men and bundled into an unmarked car? The most common response would be to dial 911 and call for help.

But, since June 2025, thousands of Los Angeles residents have watched their loved ones being snatched and disappeared without due process by federal immigration agents, with little to no institutional recourse. Instead, they’ve had to rely on themselves.

Among them is Luana Lopez, a Salvadoran American and incoming freshman at California State University, Northridge, whose life was turned upside down on June 19, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents abducted her mother.

Ana Franco Galdamez was working as a vendor in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Hollywood when she was arrested by federal agents. As reports of an ICE raid rippled through community networks, Lopez feared the worst.

“My older sister had called me saying that ICE was in the area my mom was working at and we tried calling my mom and she wasn’t answering. And that’s when we knew,” said Lopez.

Lopez and her sister Gabriela, along with their mother, actively volunteer with Homies Unidos, an LA-based organization founded 27 years ago by Alex Sanchez, a Salvadoran American who, like Galdamez, fled violence in his home country. Sanchez’s organization is leading the effort to help free Galdamez and is one among a constellation of grassroots groups protecting immigrants, who are deeply integrated into every aspect of LA.

Immigrants comprise more than a third of all Los Angeles County residents. Undocumented Angelenos — most of whom have lived in Los Angeles County for more than a decade — are 7 percent of the population. The county is, more broadly speaking, a center of multiracial culture and community. People of color have outnumbered white people since the 1980s; today they make up three-quarters of the population, and Latinos alone are nearly half the population at 48 percent.

It’s no wonder that Donald Trump sought to make an example of Los Angeles. Immigration raids at workplaces, parking lots, factories, swap meets, and bus stops have resulted in thousands of arrests and deportation orders.

The crackdown this summer is likely only a preview of what’s coming. With the passage of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, Congress approved a tripling of ICE’s budget. As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) pointed out, “This is not a simple budget increase. It is an explosion — making ICE bigger than the FBI, US Bureau of Prisons, DEA & others combined.” She warned, “It is setting up to make what’s happening now look like child’s play.”

With little help from elected officials and government agencies, and with a greater assault on the horizon, LA organizers have mobilized to protect their immigrant neighbors from ICE. They call it “community self-defense.”

Ron Gochez, a leading member of the LA-based organization Union del Barrio, understood that with Trump’s election to a second presidential term, immigrants were going to face serious — and possibly unprecedented — levels of attacks.

“We knew what was coming,” explained Gochez, who by day works as a high school history teacher in South LA In February 2025, he helped convene the Community Self-Defense Coalition, a multiracial group of organizers who readied themselves for ICE raids.

So, how does it work? Keeping ICE at bay begins with intelligence-gathering. Individuals who sign up to participate in neighborhoods where federal agents have been spotted carry out “community patrols” by car early in the morning — ICE forces are known to strike in the early hours — and contact organizers as soon as a raid appears imminent.

The next stage is public condemnation. “When we get word of them being there, when we find them, or the community calls us with information — and that’s a crucial part of our work, the community collaborating with us and giving us information — we go and we immediately denounce them,” said Gochez. This means driving by ICE agents while loudly denouncing them on megaphones. “We tell them they’re not wanted, [that] we don’t want them in our community.”

After that come warnings and a show of people power. Organizers use their megaphones to warn those who are vulnerable to stay indoors: “Hey, ICE is present… if you’re undocumented, please go inside. Do not open your doors. Do not open your windows. Don’t talk to these people” — while inviting citizens and others who are privileged to join them on the streets. “[We tell them], ‘if you are documented, come out. Come out and join us. Defend your neighbor,’” Gochez said.

In Gochez’s experience, such actions have resulted in quick retreats of ICE agents, especially when agents are outnumbered. “That’s what we call community self-defense, using people power, not violence, to be able to defend the community,” he said. Ahead of the new 2025-2026 school year, Union del Barrio has announced teacher training sessions to protect students from immigration raids.

Teachers in Southern California and all over the nation are preparing for the worst. As Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers explained, “We serve in the stead of parents for the time their kids are in school. So, somebody knocks on a school door and says ‘I want that kid,’ we have an obligation to say ‘no.’” Weingarten explained how educators are ensuring schools are equipped with ‘Know Your Rights’ literature and form phone trees in case ICE shows up. She said, “we are creating a community of complaining loudly” against ICE targeting of schools.

Gochez credits such work with staving off the worst of ICE raids. “After spending hundreds of millions of dollars, and thousands of agents, and National Guardsmen and U.S. Marines, they haven’t been able to get even 1 percent of the undocumented population in Los Angeles,” said Gochez. Of the nearly 1 million undocumented people estimated to be living in LA County, ICE agents have arrested almost 3,000. That’s a third of a percent.

In Gochez’s view, these numbers are a testament to the successful attempts by members of the Community Self-Defense Coalition to force ICE agents to retreat. “The resistance is working, and we just have to keep it up,” he said.

With accusations of ICE operating out of the bounds of the U.S. Constitution, know-your-rights trainings have also played a critical role in keeping people safe. Just ahead of Trump’s second term in January 2025, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), ramped up such trainings. Even as the group is helping with clean-up and rebuilding efforts after Southern California’s deadly fires, it is ensuring that immigrant workers counter fear with knowledge.

“There is no way that you can actually defend yourself when you are fearful,” Pablo Alvarado, NDLON’s executive director said. “The way you remove that fear is by making sure that people know that they have rights and that they can exercise those rights.”

NDLON’s credo, solo el pueblo, salva al pueblo (“only the people can save the people”) captures the confidence with which an informed community is able to meet the coming acceleration of anti-immigrant institutional violence. “You have to feed your family,” said Alvarado. “And you have to keep on … living your life, taking your children to school, going to work, going to the church, going to taking your kids to the soccer game.” He points out that those who know their rights “turn the tables … the other way and [are] asking for their [ICE agents’] papers.”

But in the face of a government that flouts rules, laws, and even the U.S. Constitution, immigrants like Galdamez continue to remain vulnerable. Galdamez arrived in the United States from El Salvador decades earlier, fleeing a violent and abusive ex-partner, after losing her only son in a homicide. In addition to being a parking lot vendor, she has worked as a housekeeper and babysitter. Now, she speaks to her daughter by phone from Adelanto Detention Center, a notorious, privately-run ICE processing facility. Conditions are horrific and Lopez relates that her mother is sometimes held in chains.

NDLON’s “Adopt a Day Labor Corner” program could deter ICE from snatching workers like Galdamez in the future. The group is calling on members of the public to “[c]hoose a location convenient to you, where day laborers gather and commit to showing up regularly. Be present. Be consistent. Build relationships and offer protection.”

Gochez remains undeterred. “There are millions of our people in this country. And if we were to organize ourselves, we absolutely can defend ourselves.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229072573.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 02:57:07.353806

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said officers will now consider whether an applicant for benefits, such as a green card, “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist or antisemitic views.

“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” Matthew Tragesser, USCIS spokesman, said in a statement. “Immigration benefits—including to live and work in the United States—remain a privilege, not a right.”

It isn’t specified what constitutes anti-Americanism and it isn’t clear how and when the directive would be applied.

“The message is that the U.S. and immigration agencies are going to be less tolerant of anti-Americanism or antisemitism when making immigration decisions,” Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions, said on Tuesday.

Jacobs said the government is being more explicit in the kind of behaviors and practices officers should consider, but emphasized that discretion is still in place. “The agency cannot tell officers that they have to deny — just to consider it as a negative discretion,” she said.

Critics worry the policy update will allow for more subjective views of what is considered anti-American and allow an officer’s personal bias to cloud his or her judgment.

“For me, the really big story is they are opening the door for stereotypes and prejudice and implicit bias to take the wheel in these decisions. That’s really worrisome,” said Jane Lilly Lopez, associate professor of sociology at Brigham Young University.

The policy changes follow others recently implemented since the start of the Trump administration including social media vetting and the most recent addition of assessing applicants seeking naturalization for ‘good moral character’. That will not only consider “not simply the absence of misconduct” but also factor the applicant’s positive attributes and contributions.

“It means you are going to just do a whole lot more work to provide evidence that you meet our standards,” Lopez said.

Experts disagree on the constitutionality of the policy involving people who are not U.S. citizens and their freedom of speech. Jacobs, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said First Amendment rights do not extend to people outside the U.S. or who are not U.S. citizens.

Ruby Robinson, senior managing attorney with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, believes the Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution protects all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, against government encroachment. “A lot of this administration’s activities infringe on constitutional rights and do need to be resolved, ultimately, in courts,” Robinson added.

Attorneys are advising clients to adjust their expectations.

“People need to understand that we have a different system today and a lot more things that apply to U.S. citizens are not going to apply to somebody who’s trying to enter the United States,” said Jaime Diez, an immigration attorney based in Brownsville, Texas.

Jonathan Grode, managing partner of Green and Spiegel immigration law firm, said the policy update was not unexpected considering how the Trump administration approaches immigration.

“This is what was elected. They’re allowed to interpret the rules the way they want,” Grode said. “The policy always to them is to shrink the strike zone. The law is still the same.”",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2018/09/ap_18242737991643_wide-a9d7ee18402e9856cb9c1419d92967c304ba8b38-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:57:05.863811

Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law.
Attorney general Pam Bondi has warned that she intends to prosecute political leaders who are not – in her view - sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement.
And blasting the Trump administration’s “false and continuous attacks on American cities”, Wu said cities like Boston were being “targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion”.
“Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone,” she wrote.","Boston’s mayor Michelle Wu has hit back sharply at the Trump administration’s legal threats over sanctuary city immigration policies, declaring that “Boston will not back down”.

Wu told a news conference outside Boston’s city hall on Tuesday: “The US attorney general asked for a response by today, so here it is: stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law. And Boston will not back down from who we are and what we stand for.”

Last week, the US Department of Justice sent letters to 13 states, from California to Rhode Island, and 22 local governments, from Boston to Seattle, that it has deemed “sanctuary jurisdictions”, threatening their leaders with prosecution for allegedly “undermining” and “obstructing” federal immigration enforcement.

The letters warned that they could lose federal funds or face legal action if they do not assist with Donald Trump’s sweeping, aggressive and highly controversial immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts.

Attorney general Pam Bondi has warned that she intends to prosecute political leaders who are not – in her view - sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement.

Bondi’s letter asked recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

On Tuesday, Wu hit back publicly. The progressive Democratic mayor was elected in 2021 to run the state capital of Massachusetts, the first woman and first person of color to do so. At her press conference, she listed some of the what she deems the administration’s failures.

“Under the Trump administration, groceries are less affordable, housing is harder to build, cures for cancer are farther away, and good news on our economy has been as hard to find as the Epstein list,” she said, essentially taunting both the US president and Bondi about an alleged list of financial clients of the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Wu’s address followed a blistering letter the mayor sent to Bondi earlier in the day, in which she asserted that Boston would not “bow down to unconstitutional threats or unlawful coercion” from the federal government.

She also addressed the Trump administration at the news conference, saying: “You are wrong on the law and you are wrong on safety. Most of all, you are wrong on cities.”

Trump has portrayed prominent, Democratic-run cities in recent days as being riddled with crime, following an extraordinary federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington DC.

Highlighting measures Boston has taken to tackle crime, often in partnership with federal authorities, Wu noted in her letter to Bondi Boston police department’s close work with state and federal law enforcement agencies “to address counterterrorism threats, protect our airport and our harbor, combat drug and human trafficking and hold perpetrators accountable for crimes”.

And blasting the Trump administration’s “false and continuous attacks on American cities”, Wu said cities like Boston were being “targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion”. “Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone,” she wrote.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec142fac6201ff2502e348192b4cdacf3909b69/0_0_3594_2877/master/3594.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06c69a2c4fb712ab1a68a4050d22a664",N,,2025-08-19 20:56:43.745575

In today’s amicus brief, the attorneys general urge the court to grant further relief in the form of a preliminary injunction to prevent ongoing harms to the states and their residents.

“The Trump Administration is conducting immigration stops of California residents based solely off the color of their skin, the language that they speak, or the job that they work in a brazen violation of the Fourth Amendment,” said Attorney General Bonta. “These immigration raids are not about detaining violent criminals – they’re about meeting arbitrary quotas, no matter the cost. It’s not just immoral, it’s unconstitutional. I urge the court to block ICE and CBP from employing these racially-motivated, unscrupulous tactics and allow our communities to return to peace.”

In 1954, California was the first of two states targeted for immigration enforcement under an immigration enforcement initiative known as “Operation Wetback” that took its name from an ethnic slur. “Operation Wetback” involved the mass arrest and deportation of 300,000 people, including U.S. citizens. Unfortunately, history appears to be again repeating itself. During his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump praised “Operation Wetback” as a model, promising an aggressive and militarized crackdown on undocumented immigration. In recent months, the President has sought to follow through on this promise. He has praised masked immigration agents conducting unannounced enforcement actions throughout California communities and, in all too many instances, stopping residents without so much as a reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct, leaving people afraid to leave their homes. In carrying out these suspicionless stops, the Trump Administration has made a target out of California’s diverse communities, chilled civic and economic participation, and damaged trust between law enforcement and communities.

In today’s amicus brief, the attorneys general argue that preliminary injunctive relief is in the public interest because:

CBP and ICE engaging in unlawful stops of Californians without a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity has harmed local economies, public health, and several other core facets of daily life.

Federal law enforcement’s tactics in conducting these stops, which include wearing masks and concealing the law enforcement entity they work for, have impeded local law enforcement and threatened public safety.

Attorney General Bonta is committed to holding President Trump and his administration accountable for overreaching their authority under the law and infringing on Californians’ constitutional rights. In June, Attorney General Bonta and Governor Newsom filed a lawsuit challenging the unlawful use of federalized California National Guard troops for civilian law enforcement in Los Angeles in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. Last week, the Attorney General’s Office presented evidence of these violations during a three-day trial before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

A reporting error showed the Marion County Sheriff’s Office cooperated with one such request.
CLARIFICATION: This story was updated to clarify that Marion County received administrative subpoenas from ICE rather than judicial subpoenas.","Salem Reporter first published this article.

Marion County filed a lawsuit Monday asking a federal judge to decide if it can release information about people on county parole supervision to U.S. immigration authorities, saying state and federal laws conflict on what can be shared.

The county said a judge needs to resolve apparent conflicts between federal law, Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, which generally bars the release of information to immigration authorities, and the state’s public records law, which appears to require the release of at least some of the information ICE is seeking.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Eugene, names Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons as defendants.

The suit came after the Marion County Sheriff’s Office received four administrative subpoenas from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Aug. 1 for information about people on parole for offenses including rape, sexual abuse and kidnapping. The four are alleged to be undocumented immigrants, according to a county statement Monday.

A fifth subpoena sought information about “an individual whose identity is unclear,” according to the suit.

ICE requested information including each person’s home address, phone number, driver’s license number, country of origin, employer and information about the crimes they were convicted of.

“Obviously we want to keep dangerous people out of our community and off of our streets,” said Marion County Commission Chair Danielle Bethell in the county’s statement. “We also want to make sure the state won’t come after our community and sue us if we provide the requested records to the federal administration.”

Oregon’s sanctuary law prohibits government agencies from assisting in federal immigration enforcement or providing information on someone in the agency’s custody unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Under sanctuary law, agencies are allowed to share publicly available information with immigration authorities. But the law also explicitly bars sharing a person’s address, workplace, school or contact information to federal immigration enforcement, unless doing so is required by other laws.

“Records responsive to the subpoenas are public records that would be available to any person who makes a public records request,” the county’s suit said. “If the very same immigration agents sought the very same records requested here, but did so in their private capacity, Oregon’s public records law would require it to be provided and Oregon’s sanctuary law would not prevent that.”

Federal law, meantime, requires the county to comply with federal subpoenas, the suit said.

“Marion County is committed to following both federal and state laws. Since applicable laws are unclear, Marion County asks the court to clarify what the law requires,” the suit said.

A Monday statement from the county said county officials contacted state and federal governments “seeking assistance in a good faith effort to clarify legal requirements. Ambiguity remains.”

Neither Kotek’s office nor Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield addressed questions about what information was provided to Marion County to clarify their responsibility to follow state and federal laws.

Kotek spokeswoman Roxy Mayer said the governor’s office does not comment on pending litigation.

“Our state’s sanctuary law has coexisted with seven presidential administrations, including the first Trump administration. Despite the fact that a federal court in Oregon has already upheld our sanctuary law, this lawsuit comes as no surprise. Marion County is entitled to seek clarity through the courts. It is my responsibility to defend our laws and that is what I intend to do,” Rayfield said in a statement to Salem Reporter.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the suit Monday afternoon.

The county’s suit noted it could face lawsuits from advocacy groups, the state and the federal government if it acts without clarifying the law. It also said the county’s decision will influence how immigrants, people on parole and county employees view and interact with Marion County.

“To resolve this situation before any liability or lost funds occur, Marion County asks the court to resolve the uncertain interpretation and conflicts within and between federal and state laws by declaring whether Marion County is required, prohibited or allowed to provide responsive records requested by the federal subpoenas,” the county’s suit said.

Marion County has been a hotspot for immigration assistance requests since President Donald Trump took office and dramatically expanded immigration enforcement.

The state’s Criminal Justice Commission logged 75 requests for cooperation with immigration authorities since January. Marion County received the most of any Oregon county with 25.

The requests were mostly for immigration detainers, which keep people in jail for two days after their scheduled release so federal agents can arrive to take custody of them. The county did not cooperate with any of the requests.

A reporting error showed the Marion County Sheriff’s Office cooperated with one such request. The agency told Salem Reporter it has not cooperated with ICE.

August 19, 2025 5:19 pm

OXFORD, Miss. — A federal court today ruled that Mississippi’s Supreme Court district lines must be redrawn to ensure Black voters have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.

The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Mississippi, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP brought the challenge on behalf of individual Black civic leaders, including business and civic leader Dyamone White; Ty Pinkins, a 20-year Army veteran and Georgetown Law graduate; educator Constance Slaughter Harvey-Burwell; and Mississippi Senate Minority Leader Derrick Simmons of Greenville.

At trial, Plaintiffs successfully argued the current district lines severely diluted the voting strength of Black residents in state Supreme Court elections, in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Under the challenged lines, the state’s nine-member Supreme Court has had only four Black justices in its entire history, each one appointed in succession by the governor to the same seat. Mississippi is nearly forty percent Black by population.

The Supreme Court district lines have remained almost entirely unchanged for over a century save for a minor shift of four counties in 1987. They cut the historically Black Mississippi Delta region in half, preventing the candidates preferred by Black voters from being elected.

The Mississippi Legislature will be tasked with implementing the court’s order by drawing new district lines that provide Black voters with a full and fair opportunity to elect candidates of choice.

The following is reaction to today’s ruling:

“This win corrects a historic injustice,” said Ari Savitzky, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. “All Mississippians will benefit from fair district lines that give Black voters an equal voice — and new generations of Black leaders an equal chance to help shape the state’s future by serving on the state’s highest court.”

“Throughout our state’s history, Black voters have been boxed out from choosing justices who make decisions about our lives and our rights,” said business and civic leader Dyamone White, lead Plaintiff. “Today’s ruling restores hope that Mississippi’s future will be guided by a judiciary chosen by all of the people—not just some. This victory is bigger than me—it’s a powerful affirmation of fair representation.""

“This ruling is a historic victory for fairness and justice in Mississippi,” said Senator Derrick T. Simmons, Mississippi Senate Minority Leader. “For too long, the lines for our Supreme Court districts diluted the voices of Black voters and denied them a fair opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The court’s decision affirms what we have long known—that our democracy works best when every community has equal representation. This ruling is not just a win for the other plaintiffs and me, but for every Mississippian who believes in the fundamental promise of equal justice under the law.”

“Today’s win is a victory for all Mississippians. Our state succeeds when it embraces its diversity and welcomes all voices. This ruling acknowledges that the current Supreme Court district lines silence too many Black Mississippians. Thanks to this federal court’s decision, Black voters will have a more equal say in who serves on our state’s highest court,” said Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi.

""All Mississippians deserve the right to have their vote counted. This victory is a great leap forward for protecting the most fundamental right in this nation, voting,"" said Ahmed Soussi, senior staff attorney at the SPLC. ""Black voters will now have an equal voice in shaping and forming the highest court in the Magnolia State. We look forward to the redistricting process and ensuring a fair map is passed.""

“Voting is the cornerstone of a functioning democracy. This decision affirms that principle by recognizing the importance of fair and legal districting. All Mississippi citizens must have a full and fair opportunity to shape the judiciary that serves them,” said Jon Youngwood, Co-Chair of Simpson Thacher’s Litigation Department.

The Mexican boxer was admitted to a prison outside of the city of Hermosillo, in the northern state of Sonora, an official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Tuesday because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the news at her daily press conference.

""I understand he was deported. I don't know if it was yesterday or this morning, but we were informed that he was arriving in Mexico,"" Ms Sheinbaum said.

Chávez, 39, had a warrant for his arrest in Mexico for alleged arms and drug trafficking and ties to the Sinaloa cartel. Alejandro Gertz Manero, Mexico's attorney-general, said the investigation into Chávez started in 2019.

The boxer, who is the son of legendary Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez, was arrested by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers for overstaying a tourist visa on which he entered the US in August 2023 and which expired in February 2024, the Department of Homeland Security said in July.

The agency also said Chávez Jr submitted a number of fraudulent statements when he applied for permanent residency on April 2, 2024, based on his marriage to a US citizen, Frida Muñoz.

Ms Sheinbaum said after the arrest that she hoped the boxer would be deported to face his charges.

Chávez's father, who was a major celebrity in the 1980s and 1990s, defended his son following his arrest. However, he has not spoken since his deportation.

The younger Chávez has battled drug addiction for much of his boxing career, failing drug tests, serving suspensions and egregiously missing weight while being widely criticised for his intermittent dedication to the sport.

Chávez won the WBC middleweight title in 2011 and defended it three times. He shared the ring with generational greats Canelo Álvarez and Sergio Martinez, losing to both.

In 2012, he was convicted of drunken driving in Los Angeles and sentenced to 13 days in jail. In January 2024, he was arrested on gun charges.

Police said he possessed two AR-style ghost rifles. He was later freed on a $US50,000 ($77,400) bond on condition that he went to a residential drug treatment facility.

But just days after his 18th birthday, masked Ice agents detained him as he walking his dog in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys in what his family described as a kidnapping.

The agents allowed his dog to run loose, and treated Guerrero-Cruz like a criminal and joked while arresting him, his family said in a GoFundMe.

“He is more than just a student – he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community,” the family wrote, adding that he helps care for his younger brothers. “He is a good student, with a kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family.”

Educators and advocates are expected to hold a rally and press conference in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon to call for Guerrero-Cruz’s release. A former teacher who recently visited the teen is expected to share an update, ABC7 reported.

The arrest comes as Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants continues to unfold across southern California, where thousands of people have been arrested this summer at workplaces, at stores and near schools.

Los Angeles Unified school district, which has nearly 800 schools across the county, has adopted new strategies to protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe, supportive spaces for all children and families – regardless of immigration status”.

“Schools are safe spaces,” Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSD superintendent, said in a statement. “Immigration enforcement near schools disrupts learning and creates anxiety that can last far beyond the school day.”

Carvalho has said he is in communication with Guerrero-Cruz’s mother, who has alleged that the boy was being held with dozens of men, receiving water only once a day and insufficient food, in a space that doesn’t have enough room for everyone to sit or lie at the same time. The teen was reportedly being held at a detention center in Adelanto, where people have reported filthy conditions and not having access to clean clothes and towels for days at a time.

His sudden arrest has sparked outrage in his community. Fellow soccer players said it was “heartbreaking to see him taken from us like this, and we’ll truly miss not just the player, but the person he was”.

learned about the stop at the time, it decided not to do anything about it and Mr. Abrego Garcia was released without charges.","Lawyers for Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant who was wrongfully expelled to El Salvador in March, accused the Justice Department on Tuesday of vindictive prosecution for bringing a criminal case against him after he and his lawyers fought his deportation.

The accusations, made in a 35-page filing in Federal District Court in Nashville, amounted to an effort by Mr. Abrego Garcia to call out the behavior of the administration, which has been going after him in one form or another for nearly five months.

In a reminder of the government’s many missteps in the case, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers pointed out that Trump officials first removed him from the United States in violation of a court order. They added that instead of taking the traditional path and quickly returning him, the White House “began a public campaign to punish Mr. Abrego for daring to fight back, culminating in the criminal investigation” that led to his indictment.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been singled out by the United States government,” the lawyers wrote. “It is obvious why. And it is not because of the seriousness of his alleged conduct. Nor is it because he poses some unique threat to this country. Instead, Mr. Abrego was charged because he refused to acquiesce in the government’s violation of his due process rights.”

The sharp-edged filing was the second time that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have sought to hold the Trump administration’s feet to the fire for how it has handled his expulsion to El Salvador and its aftermath. In mid-June, the lawyers asked Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing a civil case in Maryland arising from his deportation, to sanction the administration for its “sustained and flagrant” violations of her orders.

The filing in Tennessee came as Mr. Abrego Garcia’s intertwined civil and criminal cases neared a significant inflection point. He is likely to be freed from criminal custody on Friday after a federal judge in Nashville put his original release order on hold for a month. And that will force the government to decide whether it intends to push forward with his prosecution or turn him over to immigration officials to begin the process of deporting him again.

In a separate filing on Tuesday, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court in Tennessee to allow him to return to Maryland as a free man on Friday as the administration decides what to do next. He is already protected against immediate re-expulsion under a ruling issued last month by Judge Xinis, who ordered the administration to provide him with a warning of at least three business days if officials planned to seek his removal to a country other than El Salvador.

Motions for selective and vindictive prosecution are notoriously hard to win because they require proving that the government singled out a defendant for charges in comparison with similarly situated cases and used the charges to punish them merely for trying to vindicate their rights. While Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers acknowledged as much in their own motion, they also noted, “If there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case.”

They alleged that “a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign” against their client began almost from the moment that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family sued the Trump administration, seeking his return from El Salvador. Even after the White House realized that he had been mistakenly deported to a notorious terrorism prison in that country, officials “quickly latched onto unsubstantiated claims” that he was a member of the street gang MS-13 “to justify its mistake,” the lawyers wrote.

Those claims were subsequently echoed by top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who falsely declared in early April that Mr. Abrego Garcia “was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.” Other aides to Mr. Trump soon joined in what the lawyers described as an “effort to discredit Mr. Abrego,” claiming publicly that he was “violent, a gang member and a terrorist.”

Presiding over the civil case, Judge Xinis ultimately ordered the White House to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from El Salvador in a ruling that was later upheld by both a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court.

But even afterward, Trump officials kept up their drumbeat of attacks against Mr. Abrego Garcia, his lawyers said, calling him “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “human trafficker.”

While the government waged this public smear campaign, the lawyers said, it also used its prosecutorial powers “to support its arguments against him in the court of public opinion.” In June, prosecutors in Tennessee unsealed an indictment charging Mr. Abrego Garcia with having taken part in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States.

At the heart of the case was a 2022 traffic stop during which Mr. Abrego Garcia was pulled over and discovered to be driving several Hispanic men, some of whom were in the country illegally. Even though the F.B.I. learned about the stop at the time, it decided not to do anything about it and Mr. Abrego Garcia was released without charges.

His lawyers now contend that the federal authorities re-examined that stop and further investigated it only because Mr. Abrego Garcia embarrassed the administration by suing about his wrongful deportation.

“The facts about Mr. Abrego’s alleged criminal conduct did not change in the intervening three years,” the lawyers wrote. “What did change was that the government unlawfully renditioned Mr. Abrego to El Salvador, and he challenged that illegal conduct.”

The lawyers also pointed to several extraordinary statements made by Mr. Trump and his top aides after the charges were announced.

On the day the indictment was unsealed, they wrote, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche went on television and asserted that the government had begun to investigate Mr. Abrego Garcia only after Judge Xinis had questioned the administration’s decision to deport him and accused officials of “doing something wrong.”

Soon after, Mr. Trump himself lauded the Justice Department for having charged Mr. Abrego Garcia, saying he could see the decision as a way to “show everybody how horrible this guy is.”

“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the D.O.J. and even the president of the United States,” the lawyers wrote, “make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/19/us/politics/dc-abrego/dc-abrego-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:56:48.659557

But Trump quickly bypassed that selection, reinstalling Habba on a longer-term but still temporary basis as acting U.S. attorney.
The withdrawal was important because nominees for a full-time U.S. attorney post generally cannot also serve in an “acting” capacity, per federal law.
Instead of waiting for the judicial vote, the Trump administration simply made her the acting U.S. attorney.","And when district judges have then rejected Trump’s choices by exercising a 160-year-old power allowing them to appoint someone to the office after an interim U.S. attorney’s term ends, the administration has in a few cases taken an extraordinary step: voiding the judges’ decision and reinstalling Trump’s desired prosecutor as an “acting” U.S. attorney, who can serve for an additional 210 days beyond the initial 120-day interim period.

And in at least one district, the administration’s attempt to sidestep the Senate and district judges is being challenged in court.

Though the law doesn’t explicitly forbid the Trump administration’s approach of appointing people to successive temporary stints, “the intent [of the law] was always for Senate confirmation,” said Jennifer Selin, a professor at Arizona State University law school.

“The Trump administration has been very strategic in using the law in this particular way,” Selin said.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The nation’s 93 U.S. attorneys are the top federal law enforcement officials in their geographic districts. While they are nominated by the president, the Justice Department has historically sought to insulate them from political influence. And the president’s selections are expected to have the blessing of another branch of government — either the Senate or the courts.

Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law school professor, said the workarounds are alarming because they eliminate the vetting process conducted by the Senate, calling it “a perversion of what the Constitution seems to require.”

Critics worry that the lack of oversight on some of Trump’s picks could create a perception — if not a reality — that those prosecutors are simply doing the White House’s bidding and using their offices for political purposes. For instance, Trump’s pick in New Jersey, Alina Habba, has been criticized for prosecuting a Democratic member of Congress who was attempting to conduct an oversight visit at an immigration detention center.

Trump’s strategy of overriding the other branches could also create tension between U.S. attorney’s offices and the district courts in which they operate.

“Senatorial influence over selection has really been a critical aspect of the U.S. attorney’s system, and so has the relationship between the U.S. attorney and local institutions like the district court bench, local governments and local communities,” said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. “And when you start ramming people down into these offices without any consideration of local communities, and in particular of the district court bench, bad things happen.”

Richman pointed to a recent ruling in Manhattan denying the DOJ’s effort to unseal secret materials in the cases of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein as an example of “judges looking askance at an effort by Washington to circumvent the district.”

“District judges really care about the integrity, and, to some extent, the autonomy of the U.S. attorney’s offices that appear before them,” he said. “They, like any actor, like to help shape the quality of justice that’s done in their courtroom, and they do that not just through their rulings, but through the influence they have on the U.S. attorney’s offices. And U.S. attorney’s offices that have any desire to be effective tend to their relationship with the local bench.”

Maintaining a loyalist in New Jersey

The most dramatic fight over a U.S. attorney post in the second Trump administration has been in New Jersey, where earlier this year Trump picked Habba, one of his former personal defense attorneys and a vocal supporter, to serve as U.S. attorney on an interim basis while also nominating her to take the job permanently.

Habba, who had never worked as a prosecutor, is a controversial figure who opened a number of politically charged cases in her first few months on the job. Her office charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) with assaulting federal agents after she clashed with immigration officials while attempting to visit an immigration detention center; she is seeking to get the case dismissed. Habba’s office also arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, but later dropped the case. And shortly after Habba took office, she opened an investigation into Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, over the state’s immigration policies.

It quickly became clear that Habba could not win Senate confirmation. So when her term as interim U.S. attorney was about to expire last month, district judges in New Jersey voted to determine who should occupy the post indefinitely until the Senate could confirm someone to the job.

The judges declined to keep Habba in office, voting instead to install longtime career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace.

But Trump quickly bypassed that selection, reinstalling Habba on a longer-term but still temporary basis as acting U.S. attorney. He did so by having the Justice Department fire Grace while simultaneously withdrawing Habba’s nomination in the Senate. The withdrawal was important because nominees for a full-time U.S. attorney post generally cannot also serve in an “acting” capacity, per federal law. But once Habba was no longer a nominee before the Senate, the Trump administration argued, she could remain in the job for another 210 days, or about seven months. What will happen after that remains unclear.

Trump’s workaround to keep Habba in the job for now is contested. A defendant in a drug and gun case in New Jersey is arguing that the administration’s maneuvering was irregular and unconstitutional and is challenging Habba’s authority.

Habba’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Workarounds in New York and New Mexico

Slightly different scenarios have played out in other U.S. attorney’s offices.

In the Northern District of New York, which covers Albany and Buffalo, Trump’s interim choice for the job was John Sarcone III, a Republican lawyer who has run for office unsuccessfully several times and, like Habba, had no apparent prosecutorial experience. Sarcone had a tumultuous start to his tenure that included listing his address on a police affidavit as a location that was actually a boarded-up building.

When Sarcone’s 120-day interim period expired, the district judges in northern New York declined to appoint him to continue in the job. But unlike in New Jersey, the judges did not select a substitute — they simply didn’t appoint anyone. The Justice Department responded by giving Sarcone an appointment of “special attorney” with an “indefinite” term so that he could return to the job. The office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A similar sequence occurred in New Mexico last week. The district judges in the state declined to extend Trump’s pick for interim U.S. attorney, Ryan Ellison. So the Justice Department converted him to the “acting” head of the office under a federal vacancies law. As with Habba, that maneuver allows Trump to chain together the 120-day interim period and the 210-day acting period — potentially allowing the non-confirmed official to remain on the job for nearly a full year.

New Mexico’s Democratic senators, Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, said the decision exemplified “this administration’s continuing willingness to trample the role of the Judiciary and Congress.”

Ellison embraced the move, saying in a statement: “I applaud New Mexico’s federal district judges for declining to appoint someone other than the Trump Administration’s choice to lead the United States Attorney’s Office as they had the discretion to do at the end of my interim appointment.” He added that “the appointment of a U.S. Attorney is a process that should be sorted out in a collaborative and professional manner between the executive and legislative branches of government.”

In one powerful district — the Southern District of New York, which is based in Manhattan — Trump’s interim U.S. attorney pick did not run into resistance from judges. On Monday, the judges there voted to retain Trump’s choice, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton. The vote allows Clayton to continue running the office indefinitely, even though Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) blocked Clayton’s confirmation in the Senate.

Getting around judges in California and Nevada

In the Central District of California, which is based in Los Angeles, Trump’s interim choice was Bill Essayli, a Republican who had been serving in the California State Assembly. In his early months on the job, Essayli drew scrutiny for reportedly pushing prosecutors to bring cases desired by the Trump administration but unsupported by sufficient evidence.

As his interim period was coming to an end, the Trump administration converted Essayli’s title from interim to acting. It’s not clear if the district’s judges ever held a vote on the post. The court didn’t provide an answer when asked about it.

A spokesperson for Essayli’s office declined to comment.

And the administration deployed the same tactic in Nevada to keep in place Sigal Chattah. In the final days of her temporary tenure as interim U.S. attorney, a group of more than 100 retired federal and state judges wrote to the chief federal district judge in Nevada to object to voting to install Chattah after her appointment expired. The group said her history of “racially charged, violence-tinged, and inflammatory public statements” disqualified her.

Instead of waiting for the judicial vote, the Trump administration simply made her the acting U.S. attorney. The office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Future risks

While Trump may be getting his way on U.S. attorney choices for now, the strategy may ultimately come back to haunt him.

Retired U.S. District Judge John S. Martin predicted that the practical effect of the maneuvers is that a U.S. attorney who is installed over the objections of the local bench will lose credibility with the judges, not necessarily because of any actions they take, but simply by virtue of the process.

That may jeopardize cases in court for prosecutors, Martin said, because it “means that when the government comes in and asserts something a little bit unusual, it’s going to get a very skeptical view from the court.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F52%2F7b%2Fcf61dea34634b34c964cc142437c%2Ftrump-68694.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 18:57:35.191160

A WAITING GAME: The image of President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, flanked by a collection of world leaders touting a “team Europe” coming together with “team America,” was a rush of relief for Ukraine — which seemingly emerged from the White House meetings with the alliance it hoped for and a plan to approach Russian President Vladimir Putin, NYT’s Kim Barker writes from Kyiv. But it’s still too early for Ukraine to stop holding its breath: Russia has shown no signs of slowing its attacks with hundreds of drones hitting Ukraine overnight, and it remains to be seen if Europe’s shining optimism will last.

Despite Trump not trumpeting his “cards” quite like last time, Ukraine is surrounded by uncertainty, POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi writes in her latest Compass column. “As the visitors made their practiced pitches while sitting around a table with the U.S. president, the whole thing felt absurd,” Nahal writes. Ukraine can’t trust Putin. But it’s also unclear how much they can trust Trump: “for Kyiv, the diplomatic field is arguably more unpredictable than the battlefield.”

The biggest piece of the puzzle is the security guarantees for Ukraine, which remain fuzzy in detail a day later. The Trump administration said Putin understands Western troops will be involved in protecting Ukraine. Yesterday, Trump personally told Zelenskyy and European leaders that Ukraine will have “Article 5-like” NATO protections, but he omitted any specifics. And this morning, Trump took the idea of U.S. troops in Ukraine firmly off the table in an interview with Fox News.

“You have my assurance, and I’m president,” Trump said on not putting American boots on the ground, a promise that likely has more to do with his MAGA base than it does with Eastern Europe, as Playbook’s Adam Wren and Dasha Burns broke down this morning. But POLITICO’s Irie Sentner writes that there’s not a firm red line on military involvement — it could instead look like air or drone support. A senior admin official even said the U.S. “could participate in a peacekeeping force if it is the last piece required for a deal.”

Though Trump touted a “warmth” in his relationship with Putin that he said Europe does not share, he still conceded on “Fox & Friends” that Putin may not make a deal, and we’re still weeks away from that answer. “I wouldn’t say [Putin and Zelenskyy] are ever going to be best friends, but they’re doing OK, and we’re just going to see,” Trump said. “You know, they’re the ones that have to call the shots.”

THE HARD WORK BEGINS: The European Council met today to debrief yesterday’s summit. U.S. and European officials are already working to build up Ukraine’s military, an inevitable part of the security guarantees Zelenskyy has been asking for, Bloomberg’s Alberto Nardelli and colleagues report. The goal is boosting their troop numbers without any restrictions, by avoiding any demands on Russia’s part of capping the Ukrainian military’s size.

The room where it happens: The logistics of what these security guarantees will look like, especially on the U.S. side, are the central focus of a new commission headed up by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Axios’ Barak Ravid reports. The timeline: One Ukrainian official said “everyone is going to be working from sunrise till dark on the security guarantees. Maybe by the end of the week we will have some clear architecture.”

This must be the place: The White House is looking at Budapest as the location for a potential trilateral between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, Dasha scoops. The country, led by PM Viktor Orbán, is emerging as the first choice, and the U.S. Secret Service is scouting locations. That said, Switzerland announced it would grant “immunity” to Putin on his arrest charges should he visit the country for peace talks with Ukraine, POLITICO’s Seb Starcevic writes. Multiple world leaders have floated Geneva as a potential spot, and Switzerland appears open to it.

The view from Moscow: But it’s still unclear if Putin will go forward, especially as Moscow continues to pour cold water on a face-to-face bilateral. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said a summit would have to happen “step by step, gradually, starting from the expert level and then going through all the necessary stages.” As POLITICO’s Elena Giordano puts it, “Russia’s calibrated language follows a familiar pattern: agree in principle, stall in practice.”

Welcome to the hard part, as WSJ’s Alex Ward and colleagues break down. Trump’s said multiple times now this has been the most difficult diplomatic task yet. But if — and it’s not a small if — a bilateral between Putin and Zelenskyy does happen, “it would only signal that the toughest phase of negotiations had just begun — and with no guarantee of success.”

Meanwhile, there’s no doubt of the stakes — for Trump at least, and it’s not just political. It’s well known he’s jockeying for the Nobel Peace Prize, but on Fox News this morning he signaled he’s looking for a higher reward. “I want to try and get to heaven if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I didn’t really hit the bottom of the totem pole. ... But if I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons.”

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. TRAIL MIX: Graham Platner, an oyster farmer from Maine, is mounting a Democratic bid to unseat Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — an effort that could thwart Democrats’ plans to rally around Gov. Janet Mills, POLITICO’s Holly Otterbein reports. Platner also indicated that he would not back Chuck Schumer as leader if Democrats manage to wrest control of the Senate back from Republicans. It’s the latest race that could become a generational litmus test for the party, which has younger progressives calling for fresh faces and older moderates betting on battle-tested candidates.

The DNC prepares: The DNC is overhauling its technology to organize volunteers and voters for the first time in 20 years, NBC’s Mirna Alsharif and Jason Abbruzzese write. “The new technology includes a management system to help track interactions among the DNC, voters and volunteers; software that encourages ‘high-quality interactions with voters’; and a platform to empower Democrats to participate in online and offline events.” They’ll get a test run this year in New Jersey and Virginia’s elections.

Speaking of Virginia: VoteVets is launching a half-million-dollar ad campaign to boost Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger in the Virginia governor’s race, which will offer one of the first major political bellwethers of the second Trump administration, CNN’s David Wright reports. Meanwhile, GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears has experienced a summer of tension with John Reid, the number two on Republicans’ ticket, National Review’s Audrey Fahlberg writes.

2. IMMIGRATION FILES: A federal judge in Miami partially dismissed a lawsuit on the legal rights of the immigrants detained at “Alligator Alcatraz,” transferring the remaining First Amendment challenge to another jurisdiction, per AP’s David Fischer and colleagues. … A new memo shows USCIS will home in on “good morale character” as a judgement for immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, which experts fear will make the application process more subjective, WaPo’s Grace Moon reports. … HUD is preparing changes to public housing rules to evict families with an undocumented family member and restrict rental vouchers, per Bloomberg’s Patrick Sisson. “The rule could affect more than 100,000 people, half of them children.”

3. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: Half of non-immigration related arrests in Trump’s D.C. crackdown have been located in two high-crime areas, according to a new White House analysis reported by Axios’ Cuneyt Dil and Marc Caputo. Roughly 101 arrests have been made in Wards 7 and 8, which have long carried the city’s highest crime rates. Meanwhile, National Guard troops have been stationed in high-traffic areas to deter crime, per the White House.

The latest numbers: AG Pam Bondi said there were 52 arrests overnight, including nine firearms seized — for a total of 465 arrests and 68 guns seized since the crackdown started. Dose of reality: The 51st’s Martin Austermuhle notes on X that the number of guns swept up was largely par for the course for the Metropolitan Police Department before the crackdown. “From 6/16-6/22, MPD alone got 50. From 7/21-7/27, it was 60. From 6/30-7/6, it was 70 guns.”

The data divide: The Trump administration has broadly blasted statistics showing that crime in D.C., while still a problem, is on a downward trend. But the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. is now opening an investigation into whether local officials falsified crime data, NYT’s Devlin Barrett reports. “How tabulating crime data from the local police could amount to a federal crime is not immediately clear, the two people said, though the effort aims to determine if there were false statements or fraud involved in producing the data.”

4. ON RECESS: Senators are prepared to make a rules change come September to speed up the confirmation process for some of Trump’s nominees, but POLITICO’s Hailey Fuchs reports they’re not going to give up the so-called blue slips, which allow members to effectively veto nominees that would serve their areas. It’s a rare break from Trump, with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) telling Hailey: “[My] appeal to the president is: please reconsider. Why do we want to have this fight for nothing?”

Personality politics: Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) has the votes to be the next Senate Democratic whip, but Hill Democrats say he’s basically already been doing the job since Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) announced his retirement, Punchbowl’s Andrew Desiderio reports. Schatz has the ability to build relationships with both the more progressive and moderate factions of the party, and is a favorite to eventually replace Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

September preview: “Trump budget officials claim sweeping spending power from Congress, records show,” by WaPo’s Riley Beggin and Jacob Bogage: “The Trump administration is asserting authority to withhold billions of dollars from low-income housing services, education assistance, medical research grants and other programs approved by Congress … The new practices are likely to reignite a clash over the administration’s power to freeze dollars approved by Congress, usurping authority that the legislative branch has under the Constitution.”

5. THE ECONOMY, STUPID: Warning signs have emerged on inflation and the labor market, but the economy isn’t necessarily headed for disaster, NYT’s Lydia DePillis writes. “Economists have been waiting for that multifaceted storm system to start showing up in the economic data. The signs are now unmistakable, but the severity of the impact remains unclear.” But we’re two days away from the Fed symposium at Jackson Hole in Wyoming, which kicks off Thursday, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday will provide more insight on what’s to come on interest rates.

Taking business elsewhere: China is looking to deepen its trade relations with India after their foreign ministers met in India this week, which WSJ’s Shan Li and Chun Han Wong report is a “a sign that [Trump’s] trade war could accelerate a thaw in the frosty relationship between Beijing and New Delhi.” Apple is also expanding its iPhone production at five factories in India, part of its larger effort to decrease reliance on China, Bloomberg’s Sankalp Phartiyal and Mark Gurman write. … And Lesotho, which was dealt the highest tariff rate back in April and is now under a 15 percent levy, is looking to Asia for its textile exports, per Bloomberg’s Ray Ndlovu.

6. CUTTING DEEP: The cuts to Medicaid in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will disproportionately hit Black children and women, who already carry some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, POLITICO’s Cheyenne Daniels writes. “Although Black people represent about 14 percent of the U.S. population, they account for more than 20 percent of Medicaid enrollees, according to Pew Research Center — and almost 60 percent of all Black children are enrolled in Medicaid, according to a recent analysis from the NAACP and other advocacy organizations.”

Protecting public media: Philanthropists are putting together an emergency $26.5 million cash injection to fund the local NPR and PBS stations most at risk of shutting down after Congress greenlit sweeping cuts to public media. NYT’s Ben Mullin reports that the Knight Foundation and others are focused on stations that got 30 percent of their funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is set to shut down next year.

7. VAX ON: “Defying RFK Jr., pediatric group urges covid shots for young kids,” by WaPo’s Lena Sun: “The American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday urged parents to get their youngest children vaccinated for covid, part of a broader effort by medical organizations to bypass Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his criticism of broadly administering coronavirus vaccines. … The AAP is recommending that all children ages 6 months through 23 months receive a coronavirus vaccine to help protect against serious illness.”

In a 47-page decision, U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz ruled those detained at the facility now can plead their case to a Miami immigration court, rendering claims from attorneys decrying their clients’ lack of legal access as moot.

Ruiz, a Donald Trump appointee, also agreed with federal and state officials’ contention that the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction and moved the federal case from the Southern District of Florida to the Middle District of Florida.

After weeks of federal immigration judges not willing to take cases from the detention center due to questions of jurisdiction, state officials designated the Krone Immigration Processing Center in Miami as the prevailing facility to hear immigrants contesting their detention.

That prompted the judge to dismiss the accusations of undue process in the decision issued late Monday night.

""Several developments have occurred since plaintiffs filed this case, requiring the court to consider whether some or all of Plaintiffs’ claims may be moot,"" Ruiz wrote. ""First, many of the detained plaintiffs have been transferred out of Alligator Alcatraz. Second, many of the detained plaintiffs (including those who have since been transferred out of Alligator Alcatraz) have received access to counsel, and all the attorney plaintiffs have received access to Alligator Alcatraz detainees.""

The American Civil Liberties Union and immigration advocacy groups brought the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DeSantis and other state officials in July, contending that those detained at the facility have not been able to contact their attorneys by phone or email.

Ruiz said that there was nothing more he could do about the plaintiff's Fifth Amendment due process claims.

The plaintiffs had also claimed the few detainees who can use collect call pay phones only have a maximum of five minutes to speak on the recorded lines, violating attorney-client confidentiality. In addition, they say attorneys who travel to the detention center to meet with clients encountered hours-long wait times at an armed checkpoint, only to be turned away.

In an earlier court filing, and remarks to the judge at a Monday hearing, attorneys for the state acknowledged “initial delays” but said they were resolved.

“More meetings are taking place every day and there have been no complaints,"" state counsel wrote. ""In fact, since the meetings began on July 15, the state defendants have granted every single request for a detainee to meet with legal counsel.”

However, Ruiz determined that the First Amendment claim of lack of confidential attorney-client communications can still continue, though he noted the fluid nature of the case.

“Alligator Alcatraz is a temporary detention facility, a waystation to federal immigration detention centers or to deportation,” Ruiz said. “Moreover, there is ample evidence in the record that certain plaintiffs’ claims have expired during the pendency of this litigation.”

But those claims will move to another judge, in the Middle District of Florida, he said.

“Plaintiffs have consistently maintained that the alleged barriers to counsel and inability to engage in confidential communications have taken place at Alligator Alcatraz, which is not in this district,” Ruiz wrote of the Southern District.

Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, who is named in the suit, has maintained that the detention facility lies in Collier County, which falls under the Middle District.

“Within the site, only a tiny sliver of unpaved runway is situated in Miami-Dade County,” he said in a recent court filing. “No portion of the detention facility lies on that sliver of extended runway.”

In a statement, ACLU attorney Eunice Cho said “It should not take a lawsuit to force the government to abide by the law and the Constitution. We look forward to continuing the fight.”

Two months ago, in response to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, DeSantis and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed the idea of a detention center in the Everglades and used emergency powers to acquire the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, a small runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve and Everglades National Park.

Within days, trucks carrying prefabricated housing, generators, security lighting and fill dirt entered the area and workers hastily set up tents and trailers to house those arrested by immigration authorities and state law enforcement.

Trump visited the facility on July 1 — the day before the first detainees arrived — and told reporters, “We’re going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.”

Since then, environmental activists, indigenous tribes, Democratic state lawmakers and members of Congress have decried the detention center as inhumane and detrimental to the ecosystem, pointing to reports of flooding, pest infestations, sewage backups and light pollution.

The detention center faces another lawsuit accusing the government of violating federal environmental law. Another Miami federal judge granted a request to halt construction on the grounds last week. But U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams has yet to rule on a venue change for that lawsuit.

Should we be concerned about this, and are there other problems we should be aware of?

Jonathan Metzer, a barrister who specialises in human rights law, from Jewish Human Rights organisation René Cassin, spoke to Gilly Hope on BBC Radio Newcastle last Sunday to discuss this very topic. His words may come as a revelation to many:

Just 2-4% of total immigration per year is via small boats.

The UK press and some politicians claim many immigrants are criminals and sexual offenders who pose a danger to women. In reality, most sex offences are committed by a friend or family member of the victim. Immigrants hardly fall into this category.

The asylum system is not working due to the current backlog which arose when the Conservative government chose to pause dealing with claims when the Rwanda scheme was started.

Hotel accommodation provided is not luxury; it’s very basic and only used because no social housing is available.

The government decided to stop asylum seekers from working for six months. Most of them would like to work and contribute tax to our country.

So many of these people are genuine refugees who for example have spoken out against the regime in Iran. Jonathan is a descendant of Jewish refugees who came to Britain fleeing the Holocaust and knows only too well what the human stories are behind the narratives.

Two hundred groups have signed a letter to the government to apply fairer policies. They called for both practical solutions, which would allow refugees to work more quickly and contribute to UK tax, and a focus on human stories rather than divisive narratives.

An official refugee ‘safe route’ would help Britain to control its borders more efficiently. It would put the people traffickers and illegal operators out of business, for starters. Refugees should be allowed to work sooner. This would minimise costs.

Governments have messed up, the Conservatives in particular. Fuelling hatred without mentioning the facts is wrong.

Women and violence

Let’s put this into perspective. Violence towards women is frequently fuelled by uncontrolled social media, which masquerades as ‘freedom of speech’ in the minds of some politicians such as Tice and Farage.

The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women has called out the resurgence of right-wing politics and patriarchal attitudes which undermines women’s rights, as a real threat to women. Technology is to blame for much of this. However, the basic root cause of violence against women and girls is negative patriarchal values.

Women’s Rights organisations are under attack globally; many are forced to shut down while others are expected to do more with fewer financial resources. This is a major challenge as the scale and complexity of gender-based violence continue to grow. Such organisations are invaluable in bringing evidence-based insights into the design of policies. Funding that matches the scale of the crisis is vital to eradicate violence against women.

Prevention requires sustained, long-term investment

Civil society and women’s organisations have been instrumental in ensuring that any national plans deliver. Diversity policies are very important to national wellbeing and success of campaigns to protect women. Withdrawal of diversity budgets would therefore be more cause for alarm regarding women’s safety than the very small number of refugees who commit offences. Let’s put that into perspective:

Every ten minutes a woman or girl is killed ‘by someone close to her.’

A third of women killed by intimate partners had previously reported some form of violence.

Within the European Convention for Human Rights (ECHR), women enjoy a number of protections, which we have outlined in a previous article.

Patriarchal narratives, which discount the value of diversity projects to decrease negative attitudes to women, simply do not help to keep women safe. Tearing up Britain’s membership of the ECHR, under the guise that this prevents Britain from deporting asylum seekers, would put women’s rights several steps back. If the problem of violence against women is home grown, upholding human rights principles for women in this Country becomes even more important.

Divisive narratives

Politicians who make unsubstantiated claims are not only fuelling violence and hatred. They simply have not done their homework on consulting official statistics, and are therefore not doing the job they were appointed to do in the service of the people. The divisive narratives are also wasting police time when these provoke riots, time which would be better spent on protecting those are truly at risk, such as women in their own homes who make urgent calls. Some of these domestic violence cases were not prioritised and this has led to women being murdered.

Northumbria Police revealed in recent weeks that hiring specialists in domestic violence in their emergency call centres has enabled the force to spot urgent cases more effectively. Diversity tools turn into very important practical crime fighting strategies.

While railing against the boats and expressing concerns against violence committed against women, Reform MPs have voted against legislation to prevent upskirting, stalking, harassment, and the spiking of drinks. They also put an end to spending in councils on so called unnecessary diversity projects.

Underlying principles of human rights

In the new era characterised by Brexit, Trump, the rise of nationalism, and weakening of international norms and institutions, the underlying principles of human rights, and even of the rule of law, are coming under sustained attack.

Principles that have been hard fought for and had appeared firmly entrenched are now being questioned and attacked.

LULAC, in a Tuesday press release, said its national president, Roman Palomares, asked Home Depot CEO Ted Decker “to establish a nationwide corporate policy denying Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal enforcement agencies access to Home Depot properties unless presented with a valid court-issued warrant and proper advance notice.”

“Day laborers and families must not be subjected to the fear of being hunted down in parking lots while pursuing honest work,” Palomares said in the release.

Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times reported that an immigration raid in Los Angeles involved a Penske truck driver at a Home Depot saying he was seeking workers, according to a day laborer.

Multiple Border Patrol agents leaped from the back of the truck while workers surrounded it and more than a dozen were arrested, according to the L.A. Times.

“This week, Border Patrol conducted a targeted raid, dubbed Trojan Horse, in Los Angeles at a Home Depot that resulted in the arrest of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua,” a DHS spokesperson told The Hill in an emailed statement earlier this month. “Federal law enforcement will continue utilizing all resources to arrest criminal illegal aliens and keep Americans safe.”

Video of the incident, captured by the driver’s son who is a U.S. citizen, shows federal agents ordering the occupants of a vehicle to lower their windows. When the driver refused and demanded identification from the officers, one agent shattered the driver-side window and at least three shots were fired as the vehicle drove off, according to footage obtained by KTLA.

The driver later called police, claiming masked men had pursued him and fired at his car. No one was injured in during the initial encounter.

Hours later, police went to the driver’s home on Mountain View Drive, where federal agents and immigrant rights advocates had gathered. Tensions escalated as protestors demanded ICE leave the neighborhood. “It doesn’t seem they’re protecting us,” said one community advocate. “It seems they’re protecting these bounty hunters and kidnappers.”

By Monday, protestors returned to the police station, insisting local authorities be held accountable.

Officials said officers were present solely to manage the crowd and were not participating in immigration enforcement.

Witnesses described the incident as chaotic and frightening. “Some of us counted about six gunshots,” said one neighbor. Employees in the area reported fleeing in panic as law enforcement activity intensified.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement, “During a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, CBP officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down. In the course of the incident, the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle. This forced a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

Police confirmed the individual was briefly detained at his home but was later released.

The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which has been assisting the family, said the man has no criminal record and was targeted without legal justification. The group said it is providing legal support and closely monitoring federal actions.

The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants.","Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.

So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including New Mexico AG Raúl Torrez, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.

The United States Department of Justice earlier this month published a list of so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions,” which it defined in a news release as “states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Albuquerque appeared as the only New Mexico locale on the list.

Feds list Albuquerque as NM’s sole “sanctuary” jurisdiction

The USDOJ list followed a U.S. Department of Homeland Security list published last May of sanctuary jurisdictions that included 23 of New Mexico’s 33 counties, along with the City of Albuquerque and the City of Santa Fe.

Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.

McKee and Rhode Island AG Peter Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.

“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.

Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.

“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

42,000 RI crime victims compensated in FY24

But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.

It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.

Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.

The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.

If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.

“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”

The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.

The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.

The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks.

‘The most heinous acts’

“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.

Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.

“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.

The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.

“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.

In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.

Scores of people were injured as officers fired hard foam rounds, flash-bang grenades, pepper balls and tear gas from close range, during the largely peaceful response to a dramatic increase in immigration arrests across Southern California.

“Law enforcement officers... used brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force against people standing up for human rights and those reporting on the protests,” said Ida Sawyer, the rights group’s crisis, conflict and arms director.

The protests erupted on 6 June, in anger at raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been ordered by the Trump administration to target undocumented migrants across the sprawling, heavily Latino city.

The demonstrations were mainly confined to a small section of downtown Los Angeles.

Largely non-violent, they at times spiralled into chaotic scenes that Trump pounced on to send 4 000 National Guard and 700 Marines into the city - a move loudly protested by local officials.

Compiling the report, Human Rights Watch staff observed protests, visited locations of immigration raids in mid-June, and interviewed dozens of people.

The report documented 65 cases in which law enforcement officers injured protesters and journalists but warned that the “actual number is most likely much higher”.

On one occasion, a police officer shot three people at “very close range with kinetic impact projectiles, leaving them in serious pain for days.

“Before shooting one of them in the groin, the officer said: ‘I’m going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus,‘” the report found.

Other reported injuries included broken bones, concussions, an amputated finger, and severe eye damage.

In a statement, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it “does not deploy less-lethal tools indiscriminately”.

“Such tools are used only when all de-escalation efforts have been exhausted,” it added.

The law enforcement agency said any time a deputy uses force, they are required to report it to a supervisor and undergo “a thorough, fair, and objective review”, including analysing evidence and video footage to determine “that the actions taken were objectively reasonable and fully aligned” with policy.

An Agence France-Presse photographer was shot in the face with a rubber bullet by law enforcement while covering a protest in downtown Los Angeles on 14 June.

At least three other journalists were also injured.

In wresting control of the police force, Mr. Trump and his allies have challenged the accuracy of the District of Columbia’s crime statistics.","In a reminder of the government’s many missteps in the case, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers pointed out that Trump officials first removed him from the United States in violation of a court order. They added that instead of taking the traditional path and quickly returning him, the White House “began a public campaign to punish Mr. Abrego for daring to fight back, culminating in the criminal investigation” that led to his indictment.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been singled out by the United States government,” the lawyers wrote. “It is obvious why. And it is not because of the seriousness of his alleged conduct. Nor is it because he poses some unique threat to this country. Instead, Mr. Abrego was charged because he refused to acquiesce in the government’s violation of his due process rights.”

The sharp-edged filing was the second time that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have sought to hold the Trump administration’s feet to the fire for how it has handled his expulsion to El Salvador and its aftermath. In mid-June, the lawyers asked Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing a civil case in Maryland arising from his deportation, to sanction the administration for its “sustained and flagrant” violations of her orders.

The filing in Tennessee came as Mr. Abrego Garcia’s intertwined civil and criminal cases neared a significant inflection point. He is likely to be freed from criminal custody on Friday after a federal judge in Nashville put his original release order on hold for a month. And that will force the government to decide whether it intends to push forward with his prosecution or turn him over to immigration officials to begin the process of deporting him again.

In a separate filing on Tuesday, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court in Tennessee to allow him to return to Maryland as a free man on Friday as the administration decides what to do next. He is already protected against immediate re-expulsion under a ruling issued last month by Judge Xinis, who ordered the administration to provide him with a warning of at least three business days if officials planned to seek his removal to a country other than El Salvador.

Motions for selective and vindictive prosecution are notoriously hard to win because they require proving that the government singled out a defendant for charges in comparison with similarly situated cases and used the charges to punish them merely for trying to vindicate their rights. While Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers acknowledged as much in their own motion, they also noted, “If there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case.”

They alleged that “a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign” against their client began almost from the moment that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family sued the Trump administration, seeking his return from El Salvador. Even after the White House realized that he had been mistakenly deported to a notorious terrorism prison in that country, officials “quickly latched onto unsubstantiated claims” that he was a member of the street gang MS-13 “to justify its mistake,” the lawyers wrote.

Those claims were subsequently echoed by top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who falsely declared in early April that Mr. Abrego Garcia “was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.” Other aides to Mr. Trump soon joined in what the lawyers described as an “effort to discredit Mr. Abrego,” claiming publicly that he was “violent, a gang member and a terrorist.”

Presiding over the civil case, Judge Xinis ultimately ordered the White House to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from El Salvador in a ruling that was later upheld by both a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court.

But even afterward, Trump officials kept up their drumbeat of attacks against Mr. Abrego Garcia, his lawyers said, calling him “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “human trafficker.”

While the government waged this public smear campaign, the lawyers said, it also used its prosecutorial powers “to support its arguments against him in the court of public opinion.” In June, prosecutors in Tennessee unsealed an indictment charging Mr. Abrego Garcia with having taken part in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States.

At the heart of the case was a 2022 traffic stop during which Mr. Abrego Garcia was pulled over and discovered to be driving several Hispanic men, some of whom were in the country illegally. Even though the F.B.I. learned about the stop at the time, it decided not to do anything about it and Mr. Abrego Garcia was released without charges.

His lawyers now contend that the federal authorities re-examined that stop and further investigated it only because Mr. Abrego Garcia embarrassed the administration by suing about his wrongful deportation.

“The facts about Mr. Abrego’s alleged criminal conduct did not change in the intervening three years,” the lawyers wrote. “What did change was that the government unlawfully renditioned Mr. Abrego to El Salvador, and he challenged that illegal conduct.”

The lawyers also pointed to several extraordinary statements made by Mr. Trump and his top aides after the charges were announced.

On the day the indictment was unsealed, they wrote, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche went on television and asserted that the government had begun to investigate Mr. Abrego Garcia only after Judge Xinis had questioned the administration’s decision to deport him and accused officials of “doing something wrong.”

Soon after, Mr. Trump himself lauded the Justice Department for having charged Mr. Abrego Garcia, saying he could see the decision as a way to “show everybody how horrible this guy is.”

“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the D.O.J. and even the president of the United States,” the lawyers wrote, “make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record.”

At least three current senior officials at various intelligence agencies, all with reputations for nonpartisan work, are among those who lost their clearances and their jobs.

They included Shelby Pierson, a senior intelligence official who warned Congress about Russian meddling in the 2020 election; a senior C.I.A. analyst currently serving undercover; and Vinh X. Nguyen, a senior National Security Agency data scientist.

Rescinding security clearances appears to be part of a campaign by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to reveal what she sees as flaws in intelligence assessments about Russian malign influence operations during the 2016 election. Ms. Gabbard’s attention to that issue has won praise from Mr. Trump, who has long claimed without evidence that the Obama administration tried to undermine him in that vote.

Critics also say that Mr. Trump has turned the focus onto the 2016 election to distract from questions about the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

“Gabbard’s move to yank clearances from a seemingly random list of national security officials is a reckless abuse of the security clearance process and nothing more than another sad attempt to distract from the administration’s failure to release the Epstein files,” said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Mr. Warner said he had introduced legislation to create standards for security clearances and prevent political abuse of the system.

Current and former officials said they were particularly distraught by the removal of Mr. Nguyen, a gifted mathematician, from the N.S.A.

Mr. Nguyen was mentioned in an article in Real Clear Investigations that noted his work for the director of national intelligence at the time of the 2016 election assessments. The article was highlighted on social media by Sebastian Gorka, a Trump administration national security official.

Mr. Nguyen is an expert on quantum computing, data science and cyber issues. He has been working on artificial intelligence projects for the agency. Former officials said the loss of his expertise could set back the U.S. government’s development of key technologies.

Ms. Gabbard is not the only administration official releasing documents or investigating the 2016 intelligence assessments. After she released a report and accused the Obama administration of a “treasonous conspiracy,” Pam Bondi, the attorney general, announced a task force to look into potential wrongdoing. John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, declassified a tradecraft review related to the 2016 inquiries, and made a referral to the F.B.I. seeking an investigation of John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. head.

Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Gabbard released a memo on social media about her actions, which she said were taken at the direction of Mr. Trump.

“Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,” Ms. Gabbard wrote. “Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.”

Ms. Gabbard’s office claimed that the people who would lose their security clearances were involved in the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence” to advance partisan agendas, or had failed to adhere to tradecraft practices or to safeguard classified information.

The memo provided no evidence the individuals had mishandled material or used it for partisan purposes.

While stripping the security clearances of current officials effectively removes them from their jobs, it is not clear how many of the 37 individuals were currently employed by intelligence agencies or held government contracts. It is also not clear how many of the former officials maintained a current clearance.

Most former officials who are not working for government contractors do not need clearances, though some do informal or formal consulting for intelligence officials. Holding a clearance makes such advising easier.

Many of the officials have only tangential ties or no ties to the original analysis of Russian malign influence operations. Some have been mentioned in reporting about the 2016 election assessments or have commented on the intelligence work publicly.

Edward Gistaro and Beth Sanner, both of whom briefed Mr. Trump during his first term, were also on the list. Both were mentioned in a recent book on the C.I.A. written by Tim Weiner.

Many of the individuals have commented publicly on national security matters. Some, though not all, had been critical of the Trump administration.

After serving as election threat official, Ms. Pierson returned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to take a senior position. She has been leading the agency’s analysis team, according to former officials.

During the first Trump administration, Richard Grenell, who was the acting director of national intelligence agency, opted to keep Ms. Pierson in her post.

Members of the Biden administration’s national security staff will also lose their clearance, including Maher Bitar, who was a senior director for intelligence, and Emily Horne, a former spokeswoman. The order stripping Mr. Bitar of his clearance presents a potential separation-of-powers issue. He is now a senior national security aide to Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California.

Mark Zaid, a lawyer who frequently represents intelligence officials and whose own security clearance was stripped by the Trump administration, said to strip the security clearances in the name of ending the politicization was hypocritical.

“These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action,” Mr. Zaid said. Referring to the intelligence community, he continued, “It has become clear that the current I.C. leadership itself constitutes a grave danger to national security.”

Ms. Gabbard has been removing security clearances of former officials in keeping with an executive order from Mr. Trump and as part of her efforts to counter the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence.”

C.I.A. and N.S.A. officials declined to comment, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency did not return a request for comment.

Irish whiskey, Italian Prosecco, French Cognac and all other alcohol imports from the European Union will still face tariffs for now, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, adding that the two sides did not carve out those products in their initial deal.

The written draft of the trade agreement is still under negotiation and isn’t final. But this deep into the process, the reality that no exemption has been agreed to does not bode well for the alcohol industry. For many spirits producers in Europe, America has a major — if not the single most important — customer base.

President Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, agreed last month to a trade deal that would apply 15 percent across-the-board tariffs to a range of products coming from the bloc’s member countries into the United States. But from the start, European Union officials have made it clear that they would continue to push for an exemption for alcohol and spirits. While European leaders expected some products to get exemptions and face lower tariffs, alcohol was not initially on that list.

Negotiators have spent weeks haggling over the specifics of the deal, as they have tried to formalize what Mr. Trump and Ms. von der Leyen agreed to orally into text. That document would not be legally binding, but it would be the first step toward making the handshake agreement concrete.

That process is now drawing closer to completion. The American side recently sent its European counterparts a draft outline, and Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission, said at a news conference on Tuesday in Brussels that European trade negotiators had sent an edited version of the text back to Washington.

But alcohol is still not part of the agreed-upon deal, and it increasingly appears that European negotiators are giving up on getting an exemption into this round of negotiations.

While 15 percent tariffs would be nowhere near as crippling as the 200 percent levies Mr. Trump at one point threatened to impose on European alcohol exporters, they are a major departure from nearly three decades of the industry’s typically facing no tariffs. And they would come after weeks in which industry groups said they were optimistic that some sort of carve-out for wine and spirits could be achieved.

Asked to comment, Mr. Gill said that “the European Commission remains determined to secure the maximum number of carve-outs.”

European producers have warned that the consequences of leaving alcohol tariffs at 15 percent could be grave. The Federation of French Wine and Spirits Exporters had previously said a failure to secure an exemption would create an “extremely violent shock.”

The American liquor industry has also warned that the 15 percent tariff could affect businesses and jobs. American spirits producers often worry that the European Union will hit them with retaliatory tariffs — which has happened before.

Plus, many alcohol companies are multinationals with business lines that span national borders.

“The U.S. hospitality industry thrives with fair and reciprocal trade with zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits,” Chris Swonger, the president and chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said by email when asked about this article. “A 15 percent tariff on E.U. spirits imports will intensify pressure on U.S. restaurants and bars already reeling from rising costs and slowing spirits sales.”

Mary Taylor, the owner of Mary Taylor Wine, wasn’t surprised by the lack of progress toward lower tariffs, but was certainly frustrated. She has been importing wines from Europe for years, and on Tuesday morning she paid $40,000 in tariffs on an order that had arrived, on top of other fees.

She estimated that the new tariff was a third of her potential profits from the shipment. While she understands the desire to make American wines more competitive, she said they were just not the same.

“For the price point, you cannot replace European wine with American wine,” Ms. Taylor said.

The troops have joined an array of federal agents who appeared on city streets after Mr. Trump declared last week that the federal government was assuming law enforcement responsibility in the capital, which he has falsely claimed is essentially lawless.

The first wave of troops sent to the city all came from the D.C. National Guard, which the president can call out directly. National Guard troops from Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia will soon also be deployed, according to the governors of those states. National Guard officials said that there were 869 troops in Washington as of Monday night; the Republican-led states so far have pledged 1,000 more.

The Republican governors said they were providing the additional troops at the request of the Trump administration. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had asked for the extra troops. “When the secretary of the Army asks for backup support to our troops that are already deployed, yes, we will back up our troops,” Mr. DeWine told the Columbus Dispatch.

The number is still expected to grow. But the role of the additional troops appears vague, and the answers to even basic questions, including whether they will be armed, have shifted.

“There is no justification for any deployment of Guard forces in D.C., let alone the deployment of hundreds of Guard forces from multiple states, which smacks of a military occupation of the district,” said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school.

“Local crime is a matter to be handled by local law enforcement,” she added.

The places where the troops have been deployed so far tell part of the story. Most have been seen near the National Mall, large monuments and other tourist-heavy areas.

Army officials said that more would be sent to 10 metro stations, most of which are also near tourist and entertainment sites. They include the Foggy Bottom, Smithsonian, Eastern Market and Waterfront stations.

Near the Washington Monument over the weekend, troops posed for photos with tourists. The National Guard presence, with desert sand-colored vehicles parked near the capital’s most visited tourists spots, is now showing up regularly on social media feeds in posts by visitors to Washington.

The rules of engagement for the troops, at the moment, remain limited to supporting, but not providing, law enforcement. That means that troops are not making arrests, though Army officials acknowledged that could change if Mr. Trump decides that he wants an even more forceful presence.

The scores of officers from federal agencies, including the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security, have linked up with local police on active law enforcement operations.

The question of whether the troops will be armed gets a different answer nearly every day. Last week, Army officials at first said that the troops would not be armed, but would have their weapons “close by.”

Asked to define “close by,” two officials said that weapons could be stashed in vehicles. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to address the issue publicly.

Then, over the weekend, the Guard and the Army issued a new statement that sounded both menacing and vague.

“Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training,” Maj. Melissa L. Heintz, an Army National Guard spokeswoman, said in the statement.

But the mission at the moment is to support law enforcement, not to enforce the law, officials said.

As of Monday night, the troops stationed in Washington were still not carrying weapons. Commanders said that in most cases, arms were being stored in the weapons rooms back at the D.C. Armory.

The reason, officials said, was basic security: If armed soldiers frisk someone, for example, that person could lunge for a weapon, escalating the situation.

During deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, troops carrying out body searches were sometimes unarmed when they were in close quarters with detainees. In those cases, armed troops were usually nearby.

The decision to arm National Guard troops in Washington will be made by operational commanders on a mission-by-mission basis, Army officials said.

“Their presence is focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve,” Maj. Montrell Russell, a spokesman for the Army, said in the statement.

The National Guard has also started sending military lawyers to work on incoming misdemeanor cases stemming from the deployment of forces, to help relieve the burden on the often understaffed U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, according to two people familiar with the move. At least four of the National Guard lawyers were already working on the cases, with more than a dozen more expected to be reassigned as early as next week, the people said.

While it is not unusual for the executive branch to move lawyers from one agency to another on a temporary basis — detailing, say, lawyers from the Justice Department to serve at the State or Defense Departments — legal experts said it was fairly unusual for military personnel to be placed directly into what amounted to low-level civilian prosecutorial positions. But because the National Guard lawyers serve at the pleasure of their chain of command, they can be sent into the courtroom quickly and easily.

With Republican governors lining up to send in more troops, National Guard officials were scrambling to figure out where the soldiers would sleep once they arrive. Washington has several military bases, but none would have enough room to house hundreds of additional troops.

Most of the deployed D.C. National Guard troops live in the area, so housing for them is not an issue. But troops from Mississippi, West Virginia and other states may end up in the same type of housing that was set up for the 5,000 soldiers who came to town for the June 14 military parade that coincided with the birthdays of Mr. Trump and the U.S. Army. Most of them slept on cots in empty government buildings.

Holy mother of God! What a thing to say at 8 o’clock in the morning.

This would have been a highly unusual admission from any president, but it seemed especially out of character coming from this one. The man who is regarded as a messiah by many of his own supporters — a belief he has encouraged at every turn — says now that he knows he’s no saint.

This fear of perdition raised some questions. Chief among them: Who, exactly, has been informing the president that he is “not doing well” with regard to kingdom come? Did Michael the Archangel somehow get Mr. Trump’s cellphone number?

It is rare to hear Mr. Trump say something so soul-searchingly self-deprecating, which this surely was. He has talked often about his brush with death last summer and how he felt it changed him, but it is otherwise uncommon to hear him acknowledge his own mortality. He is old — 79, to be exact — and does not ever want to be reminded of that fact.

“You know, there’s a certain point at which you don’t want to hear ‘Happy Birthday,’” he said when he turned 78. “You just want to pretend the day doesn’t exist.”

He also said then: “My father lived a long time, my mother lived a long time, and they were happy, and they were great. So maybe we’re going to live a long time. I hope so.”

Mr. Trump’s memories of his parents have stirred thoughts of heaven and hell in him in the past. After he was convicted on 34 felony counts, he talked at rallies about what his parents must be thinking. “Now my beautiful parents are up in heaven, I think they are,” he said at one rally. “They’re up there, looking down. They say, ‘How did this happen to my son?’”

But other times he confessed he was not so sure his father made it past the pearly gates.

“I know my mother’s in heaven,” he said at a Madison Square Garden rally in October. “I’m not 100 percent sure about my father, but it’s close.”

At the White House briefing later on Tuesday, Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, was asked if Mr. Trump was joking when he talked about going to heaven, or if “there was a spiritual motivation behind his peace deals.”

“I think the president was serious,” Ms. Leavitt said. “I think the president wants to get to heaven — as I hope we all do in this room as well.”

But on Tuesday morning, a day after the D.E.A.’s announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico opened her daily news conference by saying she had no idea what U.S. officials were talking about.

“I want to clarify something,” she said. “There is no agreement with the D.E.A. The D.E.A. issues the statement, we don’t know based on what. We haven’t reached any agreement — none of the security institutions have — with the D.E.A.”

The D.E.A. said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that its initiative “is being conducted in coordination with Mexican law enforcement counterparts.” It added, “This is a significant step forward in advancing and strengthening law enforcement and intelligence sharing with partners regarding an issue that has positive implications on both sides of the border.”

The confusion was the latest public divergence between the Mexican and U.S. governments, amid an intense pressure campaign by the Trump administration to get Mexico to do more against cartels that has often left Ms. Sheinbaum on the defensive.

President Trump has repeatedly said Mexico must intensify the fight against cartels and curb the flow of fentanyl across the United States-Mexico border. Ms. Sheinbaum has said Mexico is doing just that, and indeed operations are up and fentanyl seizures at the border are down, according to officials in both countries.

Ms. Sheinbaum has said that some of that success has been the fruit of longstanding cooperation between Mexican and U.S. authorities. And she has repeatedly suggested, including on Tuesday, that the two countries are on the verge of significantly expanding their teamwork against cartels in a new security agreement that is being negotiated.

“This agreement is about to be signed, and it is fundamentally based on sovereignty, mutual trust, territorial respect — that is, that each nation operates in its own territory — and coordination without subordination,” she said on Tuesday.

This month, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had directed the Pentagon to explore military action against cartels his administration has declared terrorist organizations, most of which are in Mexico. That prompted another strong pushback from Ms. Sheinbaum.

“The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military,” she said at the time. “We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion. That is ruled out.”

The contradiction this week may be the result of miscommunication and disagreement on how to frame the two nations’ work together, as the Trump administration seeks to publicize its action against cartels while Ms. Sheinbaum’s government tries to manage its image with a Mexican public wary of U.S. interventionism.

The D.E.A. release announced “a major new initiative” to fight cartels with Mexico, centered around “Project Portero, D.E.A.’s flagship operation aimed at dismantling cartel ‘gatekeepers,’ operatives who control the smuggling corridors along the southwest border.”

The D.E.A. said such “gatekeepers” helped smuggle drugs into the United States and guns and cash into Mexico.

The agency said the project involved “a multiweek training and collaboration program” in the United States that would bring together “Mexican investigators with U.S. law enforcement, prosecutors, defense officials and members of the intelligence community” to “identify joint targets, develop coordinated enforcement strategies and strengthen the exchange of intelligence.”

The release quoted the agency’s administrator, Terrance Cole, as saying the project was “a bold first step in a new era of cross-border enforcement, and we will pursue it relentlessly until these violent organizations are dismantled.”

Ms. Sheinbaum suggested that was overdoing it.

“The only thing is a group of police officers from the Ministry of Security and Citizen Protection who were taking a workshop in Texas,” she said. “That’s all there is. There is nothing else. We do not know why they issued this statement.”

That group consisted of four officers, she said.

“The only thing we will always ask for is respect — always,” she added. “So if you are going to share something regarding Mexico that’s a security matter, all we ask is that it’s done within the collaborative framework we have, and that it isn’t inaccurate.”

He revisited the claim on Monday when he disclosed in a social media post that an investigation had been opened into the issue.

“D.C. gave Fake Crime numbers in order to create a false illusion of safety,” Mr. Trump wrote. “This is a very bad and dangerous thing to do, and they are under serious investigation for so doing!”

How tabulating crime data from the local police could amount to a federal crime is not immediately clear, the two people said, though the effort aims to determine if there were false statements or fraud involved in producing the data.

Prosecutors working for the U.S. attorney, Jeanine Pirro, opened the investigation in recent days, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing inquiry.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In wresting control of the police force, Mr. Trump and his allies have challenged the accuracy of the District of Columbia’s crime statistics. They have pointed to a police official in the city’s Third District who was suspended this year in the middle of an internal inquiry into whether he downplayed the seriousness of some crimes. The head of the local police union has also claimed, amid a litany of complaints about the department’s senior leadership, that crimes have been deliberately undercounted.

Mayor Muriel Bowser has said that the matter involved data anomalies in one of the city’s seven districts. “We are completing that investigation, and we don’t believe it implicates many cases,” she told NBC4 Washington in recent days.

Since last Monday, Mr. Trump has declared an emergency in Washington, taken authority over the Police Department for 30 days and sent hundreds of National Guard troops and additional federal agents onto the streets to conduct patrols and stop cars, giving them a high-profile presence in daily life.

City officials have challenged the rationale for such an aggressive assertion of power, noting that most major categories of crime have been falling since 2023. Homicides, for instance, have dropped 11 percent so far this year compared with the same period last year.

In April, the same U.S. attorney’s office that is investigating the city’s crime data heralded its figures, praising a 25 percent drop in violent crime in Washington in the first 100 days of Mr. Trump’s administration.

Last week, however, the president declared that crime in the capital was out of control and that his Justice Department would take over law enforcement work in the city.

The standoff between federal and local authorities deepened after the city’s attorney general sued the administration on Friday over its efforts to tighten its grip on law enforcement. A day earlier, the Justice Department declared it would curb the police chief’s authority and demanded that local officers aid in immigration enforcement.

The two sides reached a tentative truce on Friday, in which the police chief, Pamela A. Smith, retains authority over the Police Department but her officers may be more helpful to immigration enforcement efforts. A federal judge may hold a hearing on the issue this week.

Federal prosecutors are not the only ones trying to find evidence of a coverup on crime figures in Washington.

The current deployment of state National Guard forces also raises concerns about potential circumvention of the Posse Comitatus Act.","A week ago, President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet announced a takeover of law enforcement functions in Washington, D.C. using three tools: deployment of elements of the D.C. National Guard (and National Guard troops from several cooperating states as well), invocation of a statutory emergency power to requisition the services of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department, and a surge of federal law enforcement to the city’s streets, including Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other federal agents. Over the past week, 800 D.C. National Guardsmen have been mobilized for operations in the city, with hundreds more state National Guardsmen on their way, and 500 newly deployed immigration and other federal agents are patrolling the streets or have set up checkpoints. At the same time, the district and the White House have engaged in a power struggle over control of the city’s police department.

According to the White House, these moves were necessitated by “out-of-control” violent crime in the district—a view contradicted by city and federal statistics showing a significant downward trend. Regardless of crime levels in the city, however, the use of National Guard forces raises significant legal questions, including the specter of potential Posse Comitatus Act violations. Moreover, the ebb and flow of local crime is not an “emergency” that could justify a federal takeover of the D.C. police. And as shown recently in Los Angeles, the surge of homeland security agents can lead to aggressive, escalatory policing practices with little accountability or oversight.

At the same time, the president signaled that D.C. may be a testing ground for this strategy, to be replicated in other cities where the White House has exaggerated crime rates and complained about sanctuary laws and political opposition. But there are legal guardrails against such actions. The president’s authority over state National Guard forces is more limited than his authority over the D.C. National Guard, while the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution blocks the federal government from commandeering police departments in the states or revamping their policing policies and priorities.

Federal Deployment of the D.C. National Guard

Trump began the D.C. takeover attempt by announcing two executive actions. One of these was a presidential memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to deploy elements of the District of Columbia National Guard into Washington, D.C. “to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation’s capital.” While the president has command authority over the D.C. National Guard, this use of the National Guard to support domestic policing functions is deeply concerning and may violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Posse Comitatus Act.

Any domestic military operation that involves the armed forces in law enforcement should raise alarm bells. Indeed, there is a longstanding tradition in Anglo-American law against using the military for domestic law enforcement. As the Brennan Center has explained, this line between the military and civilian spheres serves as a critical protection for democracy and individual liberty. History teaches, and the Framers well knew, that the ability to turn an army inward can be a powerful instrument of tyranny and oppression.

What’s more, military personnel are generally trained and equipped to be soldiers, not law enforcement officers. The military provides scant training on how to respond to civil unrest and no training in municipal policing. Using the military for law enforcement thus exposes civilians to potential rights violations by soldiers who are not trained to uphold constitutional rights.

For these reasons, the president’s use of the military for policing is normally barred by the Posse Comitatus Act unless expressly authorized by Congress. There is a potential legal loophole, however, when it comes to the National Guard.

There are 54 National Guards (one for all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia). Ordinarily, every National Guard operates under the command and control of its state or territorial governor unless and until it is “called into federal service,” or “federalized,” by the president. Because the Posse Comitatus Act is concerned with the president’s use of the military, National Guard forces operating under state control may be used for law enforcement to the extent permitted by state law; they are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act only when federalized and brought under the president’s command and control.

The sole exception to this framework is the District of Columbia National Guard, which is always under the president’s command and control and may be mobilized as he sees fit, without needing to formally call it into federal service. Although it might seem that the D.C. National Guard is always effectively “federalized” by virtue of operating under the president’s command, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has long maintained that it may nonetheless operate in a non-federal “militia” status in which it is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Under this view, the president can use the D.C. National Guard for law enforcement in the District whenever he chooses, without regard for the restrictions that apply everywhere else in the country.

This claim has never been tested in court, nor has Congress validated it by statute. OLC’s theory, expressed in a 1989 memorandum, is also in tension with more recent federal court decisions finding that application of the Posse Comitatus Act to the National Guard turns on whether the Guard has been placed under federal command and control. Given that the D.C. National Guard is under permanent federal control, these decisions suggest that it should always be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. One might also argue that even if the president may use the D.C. Guard for local law enforcement as a governor might in one of the 50 states, the Posse Comitatus Act applies whenever the president deploys it for a federal purpose. According to the deployment order issued pursuant to the president’s August 11 memorandum, the purpose of deployment includes protection of federal property and functions and support to federal law enforcement.

Notably, courts have held that the Posse Comitatus Act applies only when federal forces engage directly in law enforcement activities and not when they provide indirect support to law enforcement, such as logistical assistance or area surveillance. Direct participation occurs when civilian law enforcement agents make “direct active use” of military personnel to execute the laws, when federal military forces pervade civilian law enforcement operations, or when troops subject civilians to an exercise of military power that is “regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.” How the Trump administration intends to use the D.C. National Guard is still not entirely clear. The administration indicated that 100-200 D.C. Guardsmen were expected to be on duty in the city at any given time and that they would perform “an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement.” However, in at least one reported case, a National Guard member detained an individual who allegedly assaulted a U.S. Park Police officer—an act that clearly falls within the Posse Comitatus Act’s prohibition.

In addition, D.C. National Guard forces were initially unarmed. On Saturday, however, the Wall Street Journal reported that both the currently deployed D.C. National Guard personnel and arriving state National Guard troops would shift to carrying weapons. (A report later confirmed by the Guard spokesperson Army Senior Master Sgt. Craig Clapper.) The decision to arm the National Guard is a significant and unwarranted escalation that departs from established Department of Defense practices. Even when Trump and President Joe Biden deployed the Guard to provide additional security around the United States Capitol and the surrounding congressional office buildings in the weeks and months following the January 6th insurrection, they were generally unarmed. While the arming of Guard forces may not itself trigger the Posse Comitatus Act, it potentially augurs actions of a “prescriptive” or “compulsory” nature.

Deployment of National Guard Forces from Cooperating States

In his August 11 memorandum, Trump also directed the Secretary of Defense to “coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service” in D.C. On Saturday, West Virginia became the first state to announce that it would be sending National Guard troops to D.C., followed quickly by South Carolina and Ohio, and then Mississippi and Louisiana. This deployment of National Guard forces from cooperating states to support policing of crime in D.C. represents a legally questionable use of so-called “Title 32” status. And notwithstanding threats of expansion, it could not be repeated in states that did not welcome out-of-state forces.

National Guard personnel brought into D.C. from cooperating states will be operating in Title 32 status, one of three different duty statuses that the National Guard can operate in at any given time. In “State Active Duty status,” Guard personnel carry out a state-defined mission, under state command and control, and with state funding and benefits. In “Title 10 status,” the Guard has been federalized, and undertakes federal missions under federal command and control with federal funding and benefits. Title 32 status sits in between: the Guard remains under state command and control but can perform functions established by Congress or requested by the executive branch and receives federal payment and benefits. Crucially, because Guard personnel in Title 32 status are under state control, they have not been federalized and are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

Under Section 502(f) of Title 32, the specific authority that is being used to bring National Guard troops from West Virginia and other states to D.C., governors may deploy their National Guard in Title 32 status to support a federal mission at the request of the president or Secretary of Defense. The first Trump administration used this authority to bring thousands of state National Guard troops into Washington, D.C. in Title 32 status during the summer of 2020 to quell protests over the police killing of George Floyd.

Whether Section 502(f) authorizes the current state Guard deployments to D.C. is far from clear. Although the text of Section 502(f) is broad and might at first blush appear to permit governors to deploy their Guard forces for any reason identified by the president or Secretary of Defense, the legislative history of the provision, along with its placement in a section of the law pertaining to Guard training exercises, weighs heavily in favor of a much narrower reading of the law. It is best understood to facilitate federal payment for actions otherwise authorized under Title 32, as well as certain traditional Guard functions such as disaster relief.

The current deployment of state National Guard forces also raises concerns about potential circumvention of the Posse Comitatus Act. Although Guard forces performing federal missions under Section 502(f) remain under state command and control as a legal matter, they can in practice be subject to significant federal direction. That is particularly true when they are deployed to support the activities of the D.C. National Guard, which is always under the president’s command and control. In 2020, Department of Defense officials confirmed that state Guard forces were reporting through the D.C. National Guard’s (federal) chain of command. There is a powerful argument that the Posse Comitatus Act should be deemed to apply in such circumstances, even if Guard forces have not formally been called into federal service.

In any event, Trump could not use the same gambit in states like New York and Illinois, as he has threatened. U.S. states are sovereign entities vis-à-vis each other, and their sovereignty is both co-equal and territorially limited. As the Supreme Court has explained, “the jurisdiction of a state is coextensive with its territory, coextensive with its legislative power.” Because of this, one state cannot unilaterally reach into another and exercise governmental power there. A state court subpoena, for example, does not take direct effect in another state; instead, the party seeking to enforce the subpoena must do so through the second state’s courts. For the same reason, a state may not deploy its National Guard forces into another state without the latter state’s permission—that is to say, U.S. states may not invade one another.

Placing National Guard forces in Title 32 status as opposed to State Active Duty status does not overcome this sovereignty barrier, nor does the president’s request for assistance from a governor under Section 502(f). As a legal matter, Guard forces in Title 32 status remain under state command and control, just as in State Active Duty status. Orders to mobilize and deploy must be issued by the governor, not the president. That means that any Guard personnel deployed to DC in Title 32 status would not be considered federalized and would continue to operate under the authority of the sending state. Indeed, for this same reason, governors are free to deny the president’s request for assistance under Section 502(f). In practice, this limits the deployment of Guard forces in Title 32 status only to states in which the governor consents to such use.

Federal Government Commandeers the Metropolitan Police Department

President Trump has also invoked Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, which provides that “whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the Mayor to provide him, and the Mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.” The administration’s invocation and application of this provision appears to exceed the authority the statute provides in a number of ways.

To begin, the authority has been widely painted—most notably by Trump—as authorizing the president to take control over MPD. Indeed, the administration originally sought to oust the department’s police chief and replace her with a Drug Enforcement Administration official. The text of the provision, however, is less sweeping, only requiring the D.C. mayor to provide the president with the services of the police. This necessarily implies that the mayor retains direct control over MPD. In accordance with this reading, a federal court essentially forced the administration to reach an agreement with the district under which the existing police chief, appointed by the mayor, will retain command of MPD while the DEA official serves as a federal liaison between the Trump administration and D.C.’s elected government.

Even more fundamentally, the criteria for invoking Section 740 have not been met. First, there are no “special conditions of an emergency nature” present here. Section 740 does not define the term “emergency,” and the legislative history of the Home Rule Act offers no real insight on this point. Yet the word has a clear meaning. By definition, an emergency is a sudden and unexpected crisis. But there has been no unforeseen jump in crime in the nation’s capital; to the contrary, MPD statistics reflect a steady downward trend in crime since 2023. Of course, the administration can still take the position that crime levels are too high. What it cannot do, however, is demonstrate any sudden change in circumstances that could meet the well-established definition of “emergency.”

Second, Section 740 may be invoked only if the president requires the MPD’s assistance “for federal purposes.” Local crime prevention, even in the District of Columbia, is not a federal purpose; by contrast, suppressing an insurrection against the federal government or defending the nation’s capital against invasion by a foreign power are core federal purposes. Although the administration has been careful to include language about the protection of federal property and functions in its authorizing orders, its public statements make quite clear that the invocation of Section 740 is in response to alleged increases in local crime. There is no indication that MPD officers are being systematically moved away from residential or business areas to be deployed near federal buildings or property.

Finally, Section 740(d) imposes a 30 day time limit on presidential control over MPD that may be extended only by a joint resolution of Congress—a resolution that would be subject to a filibuster in the Senate. Trump has claimed that he could somehow unilaterally extend the time limit by declaring a national emergency. There is no legal basis for this claim, as the 137 statutory powers unlocked by a presidential declaration of national emergency do not include any authority to bypass the 30-day limitation included in Section 740(d). The Justice Department admitted to a federal court on Friday that the only way to extend the 30 days is by an act of Congress.

Homeland Security Deployment

The White House has directed a significant ramping up of federal law enforcement agencies, including those of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Throughout commercial, office, and residential areas, agencies like the DHS Federal Protective Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Drug Enforcement Administration have conducted patrols. Homeland security task forces highlighted during last week’s White House press conference have increased drug and immigration enforcement. And immigration officers and D.C. police have operated joint checkpoints to enforce local and immigration laws alike, resulting in arrests. Local and federal officers pulled drivers over for broken taillights, and border patrol participated in the arrest of a dirt bike driver who crashed into a local police vehicle.

The surge added at least 500 new federal law enforcement officers to D.C. streets on top of those routinely present. By Friday, the Attorney General announced nearly 200 arrests, 75 of which were by immigration officers. Last Wednesday alone, 1,650 officers—including over 800 federal agents—engaged in these joint operations.

There are several potential legal bases for these deployments, although the White House has not specified the exact justification. When federal property is allegedly involved, it is likely that the DHS Federal Protective Service (FPS) is taking a leading role. FPS is charged with securing federal property along with the people who work or visit there. In D.C., where the federal government owns some 25% of the land, FPS has a large footprint. Notably, the Homeland Security Act permits FPS police to work beyond the confines of federal property “to the extent necessary to protect [federal] property and persons on the property.” FPS may also enforce state and local law with the agreement of local agencies. (Whether providing such agreement is a “service” that the president can demand under Section 740 is a critical—and unanswered—legal question.) FPS itself has some 1,300 employees and 13,000 contract guards, and it can also tap up to 90,000 other DHS police.

FPS has a notable history of overreach, including aggressive crackdowns on protesters and political surveillance. In Los Angeles this summer and Portland in 2020, masked border patrol special forces cross-designated as FPS officers were deployed onto U.S. streets, armed with weaponry and training more appropriate for their war-on-terror deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier this year, DHS paid to settle resulting claims by Portland protesters; in Los Angeles, a lawsuit brought by protesters and journalists, alleging that they were targeted for their constitutionally protected activities, is pending. The agency has also used its broad intelligence program to monitor Occupy Wall Street activists, campus protests, and other such events, in many cases while explicitly disavowing any impact to federal property.

Other legal authorities may also be at work here. Some of the federal operations in D.C., including DHS and DOJ agents, have taken place far from any federal property, such as the commercial corridor checkpoint on 14th Street Northwest. Without citing the exact legal theory behind these operations, the government has stated they serve either to clean up D.C. crime or enforce immigration law. It is possible that these activities are taking place under the rubric of a joint task force established by Section 3 of the Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful executive order. Alternatively, they could be attributable to a homeland security task force Trump mentioned during last week’s press conference, part of a program he created on his first day in office for the purpose of combatting transnational crime and narcotics. These task forces, managed jointly by the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security, pull in officers from across federal law enforcement agencies and focus on immigration-related criminal investigations.

History has illustrated the risks of homeland security task forces: Joint operation models used to target terrorism have subjected Americans to abuses resulting from low investigative standards and electronic surveillance while failing to deliver promised results. Moreover, federal officers on these task forces are engaged in the mixed enforcement of federal and local law, but they lack training on local criminal matters, likely exacerbating risks of abuse or error.

More information is needed to assess whether federal law enforcement officers deployed in D.C. have acted within relevant statutory authorities. For instance, while FPS has a broad mandate to protect federal property, general city patrolling would be outside that scope. It is not yet clear which agencies have enforced federal versus local law at D.C. checkpoints, but reporting suggests federal officials have arrested people for driving under the influence, possession of heroin, assault, fleeing arrest, revoked auto permits, and an outstanding Virginia arrest warrant. Many of these actions appear to fall outside the purview of federal law enforcement.

In addition, the checkpoints have raised constitutional concerns. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Indianapolis v. Edmond that a checkpoint established for the primary purpose of general crime control violates the Fourth Amendment, as distinct from targeted checkpoints to test driver sobriety. Edmond limits government’s “ability to construct roadblocks for almost any conceivable law enforcement purpose.” And as the Supreme Court held in 1976, while the border patrol may operate within a reasonable distance of the U.S. border, which includes proximity to maritime borders like D.C.’s, prolonged stops by the agency should be made “for the sole purpose” of assessing immigration status, not because of local infractions. The facts of the D.C. checkpoints are still coming into focus, but their legality will depend on whether vehicles have been stopped on a targeted basis for a legitimate purpose.

In addition to concerns about lawfulness, the deployment of DHS officers to city streets can quickly lead to escalation and conflict. In Los Angeles this summer, DHS officers fired so-called “less-lethal weapons” on journalists and activists in the streets, causing numerous injuries while also suppressing media coverage and free expression; border patrol’s special forces units deployed and engaged in protest response, and DHS launched Predator drones to surveil the city. In Portland in 2020, hundreds of these same border patrol agents, operating under FPS authority, notoriously followed protesters down streets far from any federal property and threw protesters into unmarked vans.

DHS abuses are exacerbated by a weak oversight and accountability infrastructure. Since the department’s creation, key offices that develop and enforce civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy policy have been plagued by weak investigative authorities and hampered by a lack of direct jurisdiction over the operations of components like ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Those agencies, which include border patrol, have internal oversight officers who report to the officials they are meant to oversee, creating fundamental conflicts of interest. And recently the Trump administration purged the “vast majority” of DHS’s public civil rights records from the last decade and gutted the headquarters civil rights office, leaving over 500 complaints to languish. Impacted organizations have challenged the decision, but if the action stands it will all but guarantee that the office will remain on the sidelines.

Prospects of a Nationwide Spread

Trump signaled Monday he sees the nation’s capital as a testing ground for a campaign targeting cities nationwide, name-checking places like Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Oakland, and Baltimore. In these other jurisdictions, the president lacks both the direct control he has over the D.C. National Guard and the legal authority to requisition the services of local police.

To make use of the National Guard in these states, the president would be required to federalize them. While the president has statutory authority to do so, it may only be exercised under certain circumstances. As the Newsom v. Trump case currently making its way through the federal courts shows, states can and will contest the lawfulness of the president’s decision to federalize their National Guard in court.

In addition, while Congress empowered the President to make use of the D.C. police department in limited circumstances, the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution would prohibit that elsewhere. That is because the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not expressly granted to federal government to the states and people. The provision does not apply to D.C., which is not a state. Statehood is the best way to ensure local control of the D.C. police—and a solution supported by the Brennan Center, where we work. But in other locations, the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government may not commandeer state agencies to operate on its behalf, or to threaten them if they choose not to.

The Tenth Amendment would also prohibit Trump from undoing laws and policies preventing local officials from sharing information about immigrants—commonly known as sanctuary laws—as he promised to do last week at the White House, by takeover or threat of funding cuts or prosecution of local officials. Sanctuary practices involve cities and states choosing not to assist in certain aspects of the federal enforcement of immigration law. Federal threats to cut funding and prosecute local officials in retaliation for their sanctuary practices have failed repeatedly in the courts. Just last month, a federal judge in Illinois affirmed that state’s sanctuary laws, ruling that Congress had permitted but not required states to work with federal agencies on immigration enforcement. The court also signaled that any such congressional requirement would run afoul of the Tenth Amendment.

Conclusion

This week’s actions in the nation’s capital illustrate the dangers of an administration willing to exploit emergency powers and disregard the limits on those powers. The administration has militarized law enforcement in the district. It has engaged in an attempted illegal takeover of local police. And it has abused flexible homeland security mandates to crack down on D.C. residents and to make a show of power against perceived political opponents. To be sure, D.C. is unique in that its National Guard is always under federal control, and Congress has authorized a mechanism by which the federal government may briefly assume significant control over D.C.’s local police. But longstanding administration messaging about political opponents, urban crime, and sanctuary laws strongly suggest the government will try similar tactics elsewhere, testing the limits of statutory and constitutional boundaries.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-22301911221.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:56:52.805952

Immigration Equality notes the report “serve as key evidence for asylum seekers, attorneys, judges, and advocates who rely on them to assess human rights conditions and protection claims worldwide.”

The 2024 report the State Department released on Aug. 12 did not include LGBTQ-specific references. Immigration Equality Director of Law and Policy Bridget Crawford in a statement said country-specific reports within the larger report “should be accurate, fact-based, and reflect the lived reality of LGBTQ people — not ignore and actively hide it.”

“When adjudicators see less information in these reports than in prior years, they may wrongly assume conditions have improved,” said Crawford. “In truth, the absence of reporting is a purely political move, not based in fact or reality.”

Organization for Refuge, Asylum and Migration Executive Director Steve Roth in a statement condemned the Trump-Vance administration’s “deliberate erasure of LGBTIQ communities from the 2024 human rights report — an unprecedented move that violates international standards.”

“This is a targeted and malicious act that will directly endanger lives,” he said.

Roth, like Immigration Equality, noted courts “around the world rely on these reports to evaluate asylum claims.”

“Stripping out documentation of LGBTIQ persecution removes a vital tool in assessing claims for protection, jeopardizing the ability of LGBTIQ asylum seekers to access safety,” said Roth.

Congress requires the State Department to release a human rights report each year.

The State Department usually releases them in the spring, as opposed to August. Then-State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who president Donald Trump has nominated to become deputy representative at the U.N., during her last press briefing on Aug. 12 defended the delay and the report itself.

“We weren’t going to release something compiled and written by the previous administration,” said Bruce. “It needed to change based on the point of view and the vision of the Trump administration, and so those changes were made.”

Asylum courts ‘will have less credible data to rely on’

Jessica Stern, the former special U.S. envoy for the promotion of LGBTQ and intersex rights under the Biden-Harris administration, co-founded the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice with several other former State Department officials.

The Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice in response to the report said the U.S. has “betrayed the trust of human rights defenders who risked their safety to share the truth” and added “some (of them) are now less safe.”

“Asylum courts in the U.S. and globally will have less credible data to rely on,” said the group.

Human Rights Watch echoed the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice.

“The human rights report has been used in U.S. asylum court cases to show that an asylum seeker could not be returned to a country where similarly situated people were being persecuted,” said Human Rights Watch in response to the 2024 report. “That essential resource for keeping people safe is not only no longer reliable or helpful, but in some cases could put people at risk by denying abuses in places where the United States or other countries intend to deport asylum seekers and immigrants.”

Advocacy groups on Tuesday sharply criticized the removal LGBTQ-specific references from the State Department’s 2024 human rights report.

The report, which the State Department released on Tuesday, does not reference Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Law and the impact it has had on the country’s LGBTQ community since President Yoweri Museveni signed it in 2023. The report, however, does note Ugandan government officials “reportedly committed acts of sexual violence.”

“NGOs reported police medical staff subjected at least 15 persons to forced anal examinations following their arrests,” it reads. “Opposition protesters stated security forces used or threatened to use forced anal examinations during interrogations.”

Uganda is among the dozens of countries in which consensual same-sex sexual relations remain criminalized. Authorities in the African country often use so-called anal tests to determine whether someone has engaged in homosexuality.

The report does not mention that Brazil has the highest number of reported murders of transgender people in the world. It does, however, note the President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2024 “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to ‘undermine democracy,’ disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees.”

The report says there “were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in Hungary in 2024, even though Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government continued its anti-LGBTQ rights crackdown. The report does note Russian authorities last year “invoked a law prohibiting the distribution of ‘propaganda on nontraditional sexual relations’ to children.”

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report specifically notes a Russian law “prohibited gender transition procedures and gender-affirming care … and authorities used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.” The 2023 report also cites reports that “state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya” and “government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists.”

“There were instances of non-state actor violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons and of police often failing to respond adequately to such incidents,” it adds.

The 2024 report does not mention Thai lawmakers last year approved a bill that extended marriage rights to same-sex couples. Gays and lesbians began to legally marry in the country in January.

Jessica Stern, the former special U.S. envoy for the promotion of LGBTQ and intersex rights under the Biden-Harris administration who co-founded the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice, during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday said she and her colleagues “expected (the report) to be bad.”

“When we saw what the administration released, the truth is we were shocked and horrified,” said Stern.

Stern added the Trump-Vance administration “has erased or watered-down entire categories of abuse against people of African descent, indigenous people, Roma people, members of other marginalized racial and ethnic communities, workers, women and girls, and LGBTQI+ people.”

“It is deliberate erasure,” said Stern.

The Council for Global Equality in a statement condemned “the drastic restructuring and glaring omission of violence and abuse targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons in the U.S.”

“We denounce the Trump administration’s efforts to politicize the State Department’s annual human rights reports by stripping longstanding references to human rights abuses targeting LGBTQI+ and other marginalized groups,” said Mark Bromley, the group’s co-chair.

Gay U.S. Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Equality Caucus, echoed Bromley and Stern.

“Omitting the persecution of LGBTQI+ people from the human rights reports doesn’t erase the abuse, violence, and criminalization our community is facing around the world — it condones it,” said Takano in a statement.

“Erasing our community from these reports makes it that much harder for human rights advocates, the press, and the American people to be aware of the abuses LGBTQI+ people are facing worldwide,” he added.

Congress requires the State Department to release a human rights report each year. Foggy Bottom usually releases it in the spring.

Politico in March reported the Trump-Vance administration planned to cut “sections about the rights of women, the disabled, the LGBTQ+ community, and more” from the human rights report. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who President Donald Trump has nominated to become deputy representative at the U.N., on Tuesday during her last press briefing defended the report and the delay in releasing it.

“We weren’t going to release something compiled and written by the previous administration,” said Bruce. “It needed to change based on the point of view and the vision of the Trump administration, and so those changes were made.”

“It certainly promotes, as does our work, a respect for human rights around the globe,” added the former Fox News contributor who has described herself as a “gay woman.”

The Council for Global Equality and Democracy Forward has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. A press release notes it is “seeking the release of additional information … including any instructions provided by political appointees to strip references to abuses against LGBTQI+ persons from the reports.”

“The reports make LGBTQI+ persons and other minorities invisible and, in so doing, they undermine the human rights landscape that protects all of us,” said Bromley.

“Erasing our community from these reports makes it that much harder for human rights advocates, the press, and the American people to be aware of the abuses LGBTQI+ people are facing worldwide,” added Takano. “Failing to rectify this censorship will have real — and potentially deadly — consequences for LGBTQI+ people, including both for those who travel abroad from the U.S. and for LGBTQI+ people in countries whose leadership no longer need to worry about consequences for their human rights abuses. The State Department must reverse course and restore the LGBTQI+ section to these reports.”

A State Department spokesperson told the Washington Blade the “information included in the 2024 reports has been restructured and streamlined for better utility and accessibility, and to be more responsive to the legislative mandate for the (human rights report.)”

“The result directly addresses the reporting requirements as laid out in statute as well as being more streamlined, objective, universal, and accessible to the American public,” said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson did not comment on the FOIA lawsuit the Council for Global Equality and Democracy Forward has filed.

Advocacy groups have sharply criticized the State Department over its reported plans to remove references to anti-LGBTQ discrimination from its annual human rights reports.

The Washington Post on Wednesday reported it obtained drafts of human rights reports for El Salvador, Russia, and Israel.

“They strike all references to LGBTQ+ individuals or crimes against them, and the descriptions of government abuses that do remain have been softened,” reported the Post.

Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan asylum seeker, said guards at El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a maximum-security prison known by the Spanish acronym CECOT, sexually assaulted him after the U.S. “forcibly disappeared” him and hundreds of other Venezuelans to the Central American country in March. The Post published its article less than a month after Hernández returned to Venezuela.

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report notes a Russian law “prohibited gender transition procedures and gender-affirming care … and authorities used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘nontraditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.”

“There were reports state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya,” reads the report. “There were reports government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists. There were instances of nonstate actor violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons and of police often failing to respond adequately to such incidents.”

The 2023 report notes Israeli law “prohibited discrimination by state and nonstate actors based on sexual orientation in providing goods and services and prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment.”

“The government generally enforced the law, although some discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons persisted,” it reads. “The law did not allow for same-sex marriage, and LGBTQI+ couples experienced discrimination in matters related to parenthood, including adoption, parental registration, and birth certificates.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has faced widespread criticism over its war in the Gaza Strip in response to Oct. 7. Two Israeli human rights groups — B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel — late last month said their country is committing genocide against Palestinians in the Hamas-controlled enclave.

“Secretary Rubio has repeatedly asserted that his State Department has not abandoned human rights, but it is clear by this and other actions that this administration only cares about the human rights of some people … in some countries, when its convenient to them,” Council for Global Equality Managing Director Keifer Buckingham told the Post.

Human Rights First in a statement said it “condemns the far-reaching cuts and politically driven revisions the Trump administration has reportedly made to the State Department’s soon-to-be-released annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.”

Congress requires the State Department to release a human rights report each year. Foggy Bottom has yet to release the 2024 report.

Politico in March reported the Trump-Vance administration “is slashing the State Department’s annual human rights report — cutting sections about the rights of women, the disabled, the LGBTQ+ community, and more.”

The State Department on Thursday did not respond to the Washington Blade’s request for comment about the Post article. The State Department also did not say when it will release the 2024 report.",https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/02/COBINA_Posada_del_Migrante_migrant_shelter_in_Mexicali_Mexico_insert_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_K_Lavers-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:57:10.726000

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation.
But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies.
The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.","The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.

The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.

Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.

One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”

“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”

Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.

Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.

“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Chuck Grassley demands probe of 'bureaucrats' who sidelined CBP whistleblowers,Josh Christenson,,,,,https://nypost.com/2025/08/19/us-news/sen-chuck-grassley-demands-probe-of-bureaucrats-who-sidelined-cbp-whistleblowers-and-were-promoted/,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is demanding an investigation of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials who allegedly retaliated against whistleblowers who flagged failures to fingerprint potentially dangerous criminal migrants, The Post can exclusively reveal.
The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman fired off a letter Monday to CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott naming and shaming those “bureaucrats” who were promoted even after they sidelined whistleblowers Fred Wynn, Mike Taylor and Mark Jones.
“To ensure that retaliation does not happen again at [Department of Homeland Security], CBP, or any of the Department’s other component agencies, the bureaucrats that retaliated against Mr. Wynn, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Jones must be held accountable,” Grassley told Scott.
Jones, Taylor and Wynn worked in the agency’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Division between 2016 and 2018 — and found out that federal law enforcement officers weren’t enforcing the statute.
OSC’s investigation concluded that CBP officials “retaliated against” the three agents “for actual or perceived disclosures of wrongdoing,” Grassley noted in his letter.","WASHINGTON — Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is demanding an investigation of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials who allegedly retaliated against whistleblowers who flagged failures to fingerprint potentially dangerous criminal migrants, The Post can exclusively reveal.

The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman fired off a letter Monday to CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott naming and shaming those “bureaucrats” who were promoted even after they sidelined whistleblowers Fred Wynn, Mike Taylor and Mark Jones.

“To ensure that retaliation does not happen again at [Department of Homeland Security], CBP, or any of the Department’s other component agencies, the bureaucrats that retaliated against Mr. Wynn, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Jones must be held accountable,” Grassley told Scott.

“Although it’s unclear to me whether all retaliators have faced consequences, I’ve been made aware that some have been promoted,” he added.

The Iowa Republican singled out Ronald Ocker, assistant commissioner of CBP’s Office of Intelligence, and Juan Fernandez, the executive director of that office, for having “improperly removed” the whistleblowers nearly a decade ago from a pilot program to implement the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005.

Jones, Taylor and Wynn worked in the agency’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Division between 2016 and 2018 — and found out that federal law enforcement officers weren’t enforcing the statute.

As a result, DNA from criminal arrestees hadn’t been collected since 2009, allowing “subjects subsequently accused of violent crimes, including homicide and sexual assault, to elude detection even when detained multiple times by CBP or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” according to an earlier investigation by the US Office of Special Counsel (OSC).

Those “exceptions to DNA sample collection from criminal arrestees” had been approved by former Attorney General Eric Holder during the Barack Obama administration.

“I believe that if you could get the totality for that period of time [since 2009] … of how many Americans ended up being killed as a result, I think it probably exceeds the number of Americans who died on 9/11,” one source with direct knowledge of the security failure previously told The Post.

When the whistleblowers drew attention to the issue, they faced professional and financial consequences — including being kicked off the WMD pilot program by Ocker and Fernandez, according to Grassley’s letter.

Jones, who served as acting director of the pilot WMD fingerprint program, was passed over for the director position at a new office called the Operational Field Testing Division, which conducted similar law enforcement work

Taylor lost retirement benefits and had his pension payments stopped. Both he and Jones were also stripped of their guns and badges.

OSC’s investigation concluded that CBP officials “retaliated against” the three agents “for actual or perceived disclosures of wrongdoing,” Grassley noted in his letter.

“OSC also noted that Fernandez did not name Mr. Jones Acting Deputy Director of Operational Field Testing Division (OFTD), despite stating in a March 6, 2018, email that it would happen,” the senator also stated.

“Further, OSC found that both Ocker and Fernandez engaged in retaliation when they passed Mr. Jones over for Director of the OFTD when it stated, ‘the agency does not have strong evidence in support of its stated reason or decision not to interview Mr. Jones or fairly consider him for the OFTD Director position.’”

Jones, Taylor and Wynn were only given new supervisory roles, back pay and their retirement benefits back in May after Grassley highlighted the “seven-year nightmare these brave whistleblowers endured.”

In his April confirmation hearing, Scott had promised Grassley he would “look into” the case and “hold people accountable if they’ve violated policies.”

“Thank you for always stepping up and supporting the whistleblowers. I think it’s a critical part of our government, it pushes transparency,” Scott also told the Republican senator.

“I do know those three, and I know one allegation that’s never been levied against them is a challenge of their integrity.”

Grassley had also relayed details of the case to DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari in May 2024. That office is still believed to be investigating the matter as well.

Now, Wisconsin and other states argue the Trump administration is forcing them into an ""untenable position,"" according to the lawsuit.
Wisconsin could lose more than $24 million if it does not comply with the immigration requirements, according to the state's Department of Justice.
“VOCA funding is intended to be used to help victims of crime,” said Attorney General Josh Kaul in a news release.","Wisconsin has joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the U.S. Department of Justice over a requirement that states assist in federal immigration enforcement to receive funding for crime victims.

The Victims of Crime Act, enacted by Congress in 1984, created a mechanism for distributing fines and fees collected in federal criminal cases. It does not use tax money. Those funds are distributed to states, which typically award money through a grant process to agencies and nonprofits that help victims.

The money has funded victim advocates, sexual assault forensic exams, emergency shelters and reimbursed victims for medical and funeral costs, among other services.

An existing shortfall in VOCA funding already had providers on edge, worried about meeting the essential needs of victims. Now, Wisconsin and other states argue the Trump administration is forcing them into an ""untenable position,"" according to the lawsuit.

""Either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law and destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime,"" the lawsuit says.

VOCA does not contain language that authorizes the U.S. DOJ to impose such funding conditions, nor does any other federal law passed by Congress, according to the lawsuit.

A media representative from the U.S. DOJ declined to comment on the lawsuit Aug. 19.

Wisconsin could lose more than $24 million if it does not comply with the immigration requirements, according to the state's Department of Justice.

“VOCA funding is intended to be used to help victims of crime,” said Attorney General Josh Kaul in a news release. “It is appalling that the Trump administration is weaponizing this funding.”

Like Kaul, the other attorneys general who have signed on to the lawsuit are Democrats. The lawsuit was filed Aug. 18 in federal court in Rhode Island.

An earlier lawsuit from nonprofit organizations, including two in Wisconsin, argued the U.S. DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women had similarly overstepped its authority when it listed new grant conditions related to immigration enforcement and ""gender ideology.""

This brief argues that placing a visa application into administrative processing is a refusal under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 221(g), 8 U.S.C § 1201(g), which is not a final decision, as contrasted with denying a visa because the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements.

This dichotomy is especially true for spyware litigation.

Take the historic jury verdict delivered in May that ordered NSO Group, an Israeli spyware maker, to pay over $167 million in damages to Meta’s WhatsApp. NSO group was found liable for targeting Meta’s U.S.-based servers to install Pegasus spyware on WhatsApp’s users devices. The verdict, which has been lauded as a major victory in the global fight against the proliferation of commercial spyware, was the culmination of a bitter five-year legal battle that included disputes over questions of sovereign immunity, as well as discovery of highly sensitive information pertaining to the identities of NSO’s victims.

The verdict came just a few months after another Big Tech giant, Apple, filed to drop a similar case against NSO, largely due to challenges with the discovery process. The company cited the risks of threat intelligence information being disclosed to NSO and other threat actors during the process, as well as the alleged attempts by the Israeli government to prevent NSO’s disclosure of important documents about Pegasus spyware in the WhatsApp v. NSO case. Tech companies like Apple risk revealing too much information about how they are protecting their customers from spyware, while being unable to obtain discovery themselves.

These challenges associated with the discovery process in spyware cases can teach civil society, legal advocates, judges, and policymakers a number of important lessons about how to minimize the inherent risks associated with such a process, while successfully utilizing the information that can be gained from it.

An Overview of the U.S. Discovery System

The United States is known for having the most expensive civil legal system in the world, at least in part due to its uniquely deep and broad discovery process. Discovery in U.S. civil litigation (also called disclosure in other countries) is where parties exchange legal demands for information that may be relevant to their case and used at trial. In other countries, discovery is often limited both in terms of tactics and scope, and there is also a greater emphasis on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. In the United States, however, a number of instruments are allowed for compelling production of various types of evidence by the parties pertaining to broad categories of matters potentially relevant to the litigation. For example, a party to a legal case in the United States may seek discovery through deposition (out of court oral examination under oath), interrogatories (out of court written questions which must be answered in writing and under oath), subpoena (court order compelling a person to testify or produce certain evidence), as well as the use of specialized experts. By contrast, in countries such as Germany or the United Kingdom, the pre-trial discovery stage is either virtually non-existent, or requires more limited oral and documentary disclosures.

This extensive process presents unique challenges, particularly in the digital age where there are vastly larger amounts of data than ever before. Locating, compiling, sorting, storing, producing, or challenging the production of digital data can be extremely resource-intensive and can prove financially devastating, especially for small organizations without significant legal budgets. Overly intrusive or broad discovery demands may also expose sensitive information and significantly interfere with fundamental human rights, such as the right to privacy or the right to the freedom of speech, and may silence an individual or an organization seeking to challenge those in power. For those reasons, invasive discovery requests can sometimes be considered a form of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), a type of legal action designed to retaliate against those advocating for issues of public concern. Such retaliatory measures can be used by both parties in a case, including against third parties.

These risks are especially prominent in litigation related to the use of spyware. Such litigation may involve spyware companies, tech platforms, individual victims, researchers, and civil society advocates, as well as foreign intelligence services, exploit developers, and criminal hacking groups or other non-state actors. Spyware companies, as well as their government clients or exporters, also extend significant resources to preserve the secrecy of their operations and technologies, while trying to silence their victims, critics, and those seeking to expose their abuses. The consequences of some of these parties and non-parties accessing discovery materials could extend far beyond the interests of a particular group of defendants or plaintiffs, and directly impact human rights, national security, and the security of billions of digital devices worldwide.

Spyware Litigation Discovery and the Risks to Civil Society

Big Tech, academia, and civil society alike supported WhatsApp when it first brought its case against NSO Group because it represented a bold step to finally hold the powerful commercial spyware industry accountable in court. Although the action focused on the harms to WhatsApp as a company and did not directly involve the software’s users targeted by the NSO’s Pegasus spyware, WhatsApp referred to the victims — over 100 of whom were members of civil society — during the pre-trial stages. Access Now, a non-profit focused on digital civil rights, along with other NGOs, also submitted an amicus brief when NSO initially appealed the case to the 9th Circuit, highlighting the stories of several civil society victims and the importance of WhatsApp’s action as potentially the only chance at justice these individuals had.

NSO, in the words of the District Court Judge Phyllis Hamilton, “repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery and failed to obey court orders regarding such discovery.” Nevertheless, NSO leveraged the discovery process to try to obtain sensitive information not only about WhatsApp but also third parties, such as civil society victims and security researchers.

For example, one major point of contention during the discovery process was the identities of the individuals whose Android phones were targeted by NSO’s exploitation of WhatsApp’s vulnerabilities. NSO attempted to challenge whether those victims were indeed members of civil society, as opposed to criminals or terrorists, which would have allegedly made them legitimate targets of hacking. Unsatisfied with obtaining thousands of documents from WhatsApp, NSO sought additional discovery from an uninvolved party — the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. The research group has been responsible for the lion’s share of investigations uncovering NSO’s spyware abuses around the world, including the very first documented case of Pegasus spyware use against an Emirati human rights defender, Ahmed Mansoor. When WhatsApp discovered that NSO exploited vulnerabilities in the tech company’s app to target users with Pegasus spyware, the Citizen Lab helped identify cases where the attack’s suspected targets were members of civil society, such as human rights activists and journalists.

Over the course of many months, NSO submitted multiple discovery requests to the Citizen Lab seeking to compel deposition and document production related to the identities of the civil society victims and the organization’s research methods, arguing that this information was essential for NSO’s defense against WhatsApp’s lawsuit. Needless to say, this arbitrary “fishing expedition” sought information that was extremely sensitive and, in fact, protected under the University of Toronto’s research ethics protocols. The Citizen Lab had an obligation to protect the confidentiality of their research subjects, which is why they used every legal means possible to resist such requests. However, many researchers and civil society organizations investigating spyware lack the protections and resources offered by a major university to defend themselves against such invasive discovery requests. This seriously risks chilling public interest spyware research and accountability efforts and discouraging victims from participating in such measures.

NSO’s tactics were especially worrisome given the company’s history and its customers’ retaliation against researchers and advocates who expose its abuses and seek justice. In fact, one confirmed target in the WhatsApp Pegasus hack was a British lawyer representing a group of Mexican journalists and government critics and a Saudi dissident living in Canada, suing NSO in Israel for the targeting of their phones. We consider these cross-border attacks to be transnational repression and a tool of digital authoritarianism.

Another prominent British lawyer, Rodney Dixon, was targeted with Pegasus spyware in 2019, likely in retaliation for representing his clients Matthew Hedges, a British doctoral student jailed in the United Arab Emirates, and Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Cengiz’s device was also infected with Pegasus, likely in response to her seeking accountability for Khashoggi’s brutal murder by Saudi agents in Turkey.

But the retaliation goes beyond just spyware. There are several reported cases of lawyers and researchers, including at the Citizen Lab, being targeted with social engineering and other types of intelligence operations aimed at gathering sensitive information about the lawsuits against NSO as well as information that could discredit NSO’s and their clients’ critics and forensic researchers. Given this context, NSO’s (ab)use of discovery against the Citizen Lab appeared even more sinister.

Ultimately, the district court judge was not convinced by NSO’s arguments, denying NSO’s discovery requests sent to the Citizen Lab and labelling them irrelevant and disproportionate to the needs of the case. However, this example demonstrates how spyware companies may turn the tables against their victims and researchers and subject them to invasive discovery requests that require significant amounts of legal resources and risk chilling digital security research and human rights activities.

Spyware Litigation Discovery Poses National Security Risks

Invasive discovery requests can also discourage major companies, such as Apple, from pursuing legal action out of concern that it will endanger sensitive threat intelligence information, highly sought after not just by the spyware companies themselves, but also by foreign government adversaries and hostile non-state actors.

It is no accident that threat intelligence teams at major tech platforms defending against governmental hacking typically also work on mercenary spyware. This is because the exploits leveraged by mercenary spyware like NSO Group’s Pegasus include capabilities that could compete with those that were “previously thought to be accessible to only a handful of nation states.” Moreover, exploits used by mercenary spyware companies have repeatedly been found in use by hostile foreign intelligence services. For example, Google found that exploits used by NSO Group and Intellexa (the maker of Predator spyware) were reused by APT29, a cyber espionage group attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service. Whether these spyware companies are doing business with the same exploit sellers as Russia or the exploits are being leaked, this indicates that the spyware industry is uncomfortably close to hostile foreign intelligence activity.

The operations and detection techniques of tech platforms’ threat intelligence teams are proprietary and closely-guarded. This is because information — such as the ways that protocols, crashes, and logs are scrutinized for evidence of exploit testing and hacking activity — can all be used by any threat actor conducting attacks across their platforms to develop hacking techniques and methods of evading detection.

Discovery in cases where platforms’ threat teams have identified, tracked, and blocked an advanced threat actor or exploit could provide an unprecedented window into how these teams frustrate espionage attempts, including against targets such as heads of states. Since business activities of mercenary spyware companies, criminal hacker groups, and foreign intelligence operations are constantly in progress, depending on the category of information, it may reasonably be expected to provide immediate benefit to ongoing efforts by multiple hostile foreign intelligence services, mercenary spyware companies, exploit developers, and criminals to commit illegal intrusions that evade detection. For example, as the WhatsApp v. NSO record revealed, NSO Group continued to develop and deploy the techniques to help their customers hack WhatsApp users even after the legal case was filed.

Similarly, the non-public methods and technologies used by researchers like the Citizen Lab, Amnesty International Security Lab, or commercial research organizations are of strong interest to hacking groups, foreign intelligence services, and mercenary spyware customers past, present, and future. Exposing these methods could provide immediate benefit to many groups engaged in illegal or abusive activities.

Even if all of the parties and their representatives in spyware litigation will seek to strictly adhere to the protective orders that may be issued to safeguard the sensitive discovery information from being shared with third parties, merely by possessing this information, their systems become an attractive target for state and non-state-affiliated hackers. Similarly, depending on their home jurisdiction, parties or their representatives may face direct pressure or be compelled to provide information to foreign governments.

Discovery as an Opportunity for Justice

Despite significant challenges and risks associated with the discovery process in U.S. spyware litigation, the WhatsApp v. NSO case also shows that it can present tremendous opportunities for victims, researchers, and advocates, which makes pursuing such litigation worthwhile.

One of the trial’s most surprising outcomes was that despite NSO’s (and allegedly the Israeli government’s) attempts to avoid discovery, WhatsApp was nevertheless able to obtain a wealth of valuable information from NSO about its technology and operations. For example, the depositions of NSO’s Vice President Ramon Eshkar, Chief Operating Officer Yaron Shohat, and Research and Development Vice President Tamir Gazneli revealed that the product understood as “Pegasus” is not just one piece of technology or a physical box, but a whole package of products and services that NSO provides to its government customers.

The parts of the depositions that made it into the public record show that Pegasus includes the hardware installed at the government customer’s premises, such as the laptop containing the user interface software where the customer enters the phone number of the desired targets, as well as servers that allow the user interface to work and contain storage of the hacked information. Most importantly, it includes the so-called zero-day vulnerability installation vector developed by NSO that allows government customers to seamlessly gain access to various types of data and functions of the target’s device (depending on the vector used) from their user interface with a push of a button. This ultimately confirms what many researchers have suspected about the capabilities of Pegasus and the fact that NSO, not their customers, are responsible for the installation and extraction process of the Pegasus system.

Such information can be of a significant value to researchers, litigators, judges, activists, as well as policymakers. For example, in debates around regulating spyware technologies, not enough attention has been paid to the actual technical characteristics and operation of the spyware, primarily due to the spyware industry’s secrecy and lack of transparency over governments’ operations of spyware products. NSO and other companies exposed by researchers and journalists for selling repressive technologies have also used defamation and threats of defamation lawsuits to challenge claims about the capabilities of their products and the extent to which they or their customers are responsible for operating it.

Regardless whether a given spyware legal case results in a victory for the plaintiff, the information that arises from the litigation discovery process can shed light on the spyware’s technical capabilities and operation, as well as the spyware products’ prices, the company’s profits, and the identity of its customers — all of which could be incredibly valuable for research, advocacy, and regulation.

Managing the Risks of Spyware Litigation

The U.S. legal system’s extensive discovery process makes spyware litigation a double-edged sword, posing costly challenges to plaintiffs and third parties while exposing their sensitive information. It can also offer an opportunity to obtain crucial evidence that may lead to a victory in the courtroom, but also to successful regulation and curbing of the spyware industry. There are ways to minimize the risks while increasing the benefits.

First, judges, while respecting the defendants’ fair trial rights, should be aware of the unique digital and national security risks that invasive discovery requests pose to victims, researchers, and civil society organizations exposing the abuses of spyware. Spyware companies may be perversely incentivized to use the justice system to go on fishing expeditions and intimidate the community exposing the industry’s abuses. It is also crucial to understand the risks of the foreign intelligence services, exploit developers, and criminals benefiting from discovery materials to learn how sophisticated spyware is detected and how researchers, civil society, and tech platforms operate.

Second, spyware researchers, human rights organizations, lawyers, companies, and the victims themselves must be prepared for potentially invasive discovery requests if they become involved in litigation related to the use of spyware, directly or indirectly. To mitigate risks, they should ensure their data and security policies are in order, and that they have sufficient technical and legal capacity to respond to such requests — even if they plan to oppose them.

Third, funders and donors that provide funding for spyware research or advocacy need to ensure that there are sufficient resources included for anti-SLAPP defense, including fighting off overbroad and retaliatory discovery requests. Law firms and law school legal clinics can also play a major role in providing pro bono support in these cases to non-profits and individual victims who cannot afford an appropriate legal defense.

Finally, journalists, researchers, lawyers, activists, and policymakers should rely on evidence obtained through discovery and disclosure processes in spyware litigation to inform their reporting, investigations, and lawsuits, as well as policy and lawmaking to ensure accurate and evidence-based reporting, advocacy, and policies. Sanctions authorities should also keep a close eye on disclosures to better identify irresponsible actors and their malicious technologies.

Taken together, these steps will help ensure that the discovery process in spyware litigation cases contributes to justice and accountability and avoids putting victims, researchers, and other vulnerable parties and their sensitive information at risk.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-21889237101.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:57:21.395885

More than 20 state attorneys general have filed suit against the Department of Justice (DOJ), alleging the Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to withhold critical funds for crime victims from states and nonprofits deemed noncompliant with its draconian immigration enforcement efforts.

The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Rhode Island on Monday, centers on three notices that DOJ posted last month for funding allocated by a decades-old law called the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). As I previously reported for Mother Jones, those funds have long been a critical source of support for organizations including domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, and child advocacy centers, which use the money to run emergency shelters and hotlines and provide therapy services, legal advocacy, and court accompaniment to abused people, particularly women and children. Another bucket of VOCA funding also goes directly to crime victims, who can use the funds for pay for services including mental health counseling, funeral expenses, and clean-ups of crime scenes.

But under the Trump administration, this year’s round of $1.9 billion in funding comes with strings attached: It stipulates that grantees may not use the funds for any program or activity that, in DOJ’s opinion, “violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law…or impedes or hinders” enforcement.

While the funding announcements do not clarify what, exactly, would constitute such violations, the intent seems clear: Trump’s DOJ wants to essentially force states and the programs they fund to grant the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), unfettered access to the victims they serve—conditions that the lawsuit calls “unprecedented.”

“Playing politics with the lives of people who have suffered so greatly is reckless, it is cruel, and in this case—it is illegal,” said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, the lead plaintiff, in a statement.

Advocates for crime victims say that, if enacted, these conditions could have a chilling effect on immigrant survivors of violence, who may avoid seeking help for fear of being deported. “One huge barrier for victims to leave an abusive situation is fear of their abusers reporting them to immigration, which is a real threat, even when the survivor has a path to lawful status,” Carmen McDonald, executive director of Survivor Justice Center, a Los Angeles organization that supports immigrant survivors of domestic violence, told me. “This will continue to cause victims to be unsafe at home and have devastating impacts for survivors.”

As I reported in June, McDonald and other domestic violence service providers in LA saw these impacts firsthand when ICE increased its presence in the city earlier this summer. Several providers told me that survivors were afraid to show up to court appointments and seek in-person help at shelters because they worried that it could put them at risk of deportation or detention from ICE.

These fears were worsened by the fact that Trump administration also rescinded Biden administration guidance characterizing domestic violence shelters and victim services centers, among others, as “protected spaces” where immigration enforcement should not take place due to the harm it could inflict on a community. It seems unsurprising, then, that a survey of more than 170 advocates and attorneys, conducted earlier this year by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, found that nearly 80 percent of advocates reported an increase in immigration-related questions from immigrant survivors since Trump’s election last year.

Now, the administration is trying to use another yet tool in its arsenal—billions in federal funding—to strong-arm nonprofits reliant on VOCA funds into cooperating with Trump’s mass deportation agenda. As I reported last year, VOCA funds come mostly from financial penalties levied in corporate criminal cases; the DOJ distributes a portion of the funds to states, while another portion of the funds are earmarked for direct compensation to eligible victims.

In the last fiscal year, the funds served more than 7 million victims, most of whom were women and victims of domestic violence, assault, and child sex abuse, according to DOJ data. That data does not specify how much of the funding went to immigration-related programs, but shows that it served millions through individual advocacy, legal advice, and referrals to other programs—all services that could theoretically include support for immigrants.

But the available VOCA funds have been declining as federal prosecutors have pursued more deferred and non-prosecution agreements, which allow defendants more time to pay up or avoid charges entirely if they cooperate with the government. That has already left organizations relying on VOCA funds stretched thin, with programs serving LGBTQ and immigrant survivors particularly difficult to fundraise for due to the hot-button politics around the clients they serve, sources previously told me.

If Trump’s DOJ prevails in court, that landscape is poised to get even worse. Krista Colon, executive director of the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, said service providers “should not have to interrupt these services because of fears of running afoul of new, unrelated grant terms and conditions, just as they should not have to fear catastrophic cuts.”

The lawsuit alleges that the conditions seeking to mandate immigration enforcement are unlawful under various provisions of both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which governs how agencies operate; the complaint states, for example, that the DOJ does not have the authority to mandate compliance with federal enforcement due to the Constitution’s separation of powers, and that the requirements are “arbitrary and capricious,” in violation of the APA. It names as defendants Attorney General Pam Bondi and two of her subordinates, as well as the offices all three represent. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.

This is one of many times the Trump administration has threatened harm to survivors of crimes: The DOJ previously cancelled more than $800 million in grants for crime victims’ services, before restoring some following public outcry and reporting from Mother Jones. The latest lawsuit also follows another, similar suit, filed in June by 17 state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions, which targeted anti-DEI conditions that Trump’s DOJ imposed on funding allocated by the Violence Against Women Act; earlier this month, a federal judge issued a preliminary stay, temporarily blocking the administration’s requirements on those grants.

Advocates are hoping plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit will find similar success. As Colon, executive director of the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, put it: “Domestic violence does not discriminate.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_08_18_bondi-1-e1755548733346.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-19 15:57:27.655775

It also expanded the number of alleged crimes for which state law enforcement can cooperate with ICE.","Days before a 2025 funding decision, Connecticut attorney general William Tong has joined a multi-state lawsuit against restrictions the Trump administration has placed on funding for victims of crime.

Connecticut is one of 21 states suing to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) from withholding grants the state receives through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). The DOJ recently announced the availability of $15.9 million in funding for victims of crime through the Crime Victims Fund. The fund was created by VOCA when it became law in 1984. It is funded by fines levied against convictions of largely white-collar crimes. Funding, which is administered by states, can cover a variety of services, from financial support for medical bills to 24/7 hotlines for crime victims.

The DOJ’s funding announcement stated that programs or activities that “directly or indirectly” violate civil immigration law in part by failing to “give access to DHS agents, or honor DHS requests and provide requested notice to DHS agents” fall outside the program scope and will not receive funding.

But a number of states, including Connecticut, are crying foul as the bulk of money comes from formula grants.

In the past few years, Connecticut has received between roughly $8.5 and $15.6 million in victim assistance formula grants and between roughly $840,000 $1.3 million in victim assistance formula grants from the Crime Victims Fund. Funds are administered by the Judicial Branch’s Office of Victim Services. Eligible individuals can receive up to $15,000 for physical injuries, up to $5,000 for emotional injuries, and up to $25,000 in survivor benefits.

According to the DOJ, the state awarded roughly $23 million in victim assistance formula grants in 2024 and served 401,585 people. It also paid roughly $2.4 million in 885 claims through the victim compensation formula grant program.

Tong’s office said in a press release that the new immigration requirement threatens $14.5 million in funding for the state.

‘This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers, and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce States to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Tong and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.” a press release from Tong’s office announcing the lawsuit stated.

The lawsuit also claims that the move violates the separation of powers, as the Constitution does not give executive branch agencies the power to unilaterally withhold spending that Congress has authorized, except for in very specific conditions that do not apply here.

The immigration requirements, the lawsuit states, amount to “refusing to spend money that Congress intends to be used for crime victims” until the conditions the administration has imposed are met.

Connecticut was recently placed on a list of ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’ by the Trump administration, sparking a back-and-forth between attorney general Pam Bondi and Gov. Ned Lamont over what exactly that term means. Bondi has given the state until August 19 to confirm its ‘commitment’ to complying with federal immigration law and has threatened potential fines. While Bondi has not named the state’s so-called ‘sanctuary policies and practices,’ the federal government is presumably aiming at Connecticut’s Trust Act.

The law prevents state and local law enforcement from arresting someone solely because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has issued a detainer, unless that person is wanted on terrorism charges or certain class A or B felonies. The legislature voted to expand and amend the Trust Act this year. Individuals can now sue towns that cooperate with ICE, in violation of the law. It also expanded the number of alleged crimes for which state law enforcement can cooperate with ICE.

Funding for victims of crimes has already faced shortfalls in recent years as VOCA funds have declined, leading victim advocates to worry about the suspension of services that rely on those dollars. The shortfall was temporarily made up with federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars, which have since expired. In 2018, the state received $36.45 million through VOCA. This year, it’s projected to receive a little more than half that.",https://i0.wp.com/insideinvestigator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/News-8.19.2025-TongSues.png?fit=1200%2C628&quality=61&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-19 17:56:56.696998

Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.
Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.","Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.

The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.

Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations — just several hundred over two years — but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.

Both agreements are based on a ""safe third country"" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.

The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.

At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.

Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.

A senior State Department official said, ""We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.""

Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.

In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.

The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.

Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a ""safe third country"" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.

Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.

In a report released last week, the State Department described ""negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,"" citing unlawful killings, ""arbitrary"" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.

Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in ""exceptional"" cases only.

Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage — like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments — to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.

Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.

""The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,"" she said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/19/1e48dec9-70c5-4356-b218-f752a3c2faf4/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ed8bce20d67aefe77916801dcf844462/gettyimages-2196376791.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 15:57:12.867493

Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.
Gee found that Flores co-counsel had shown the government was in “substantial noncompliance” with the agreement, leaving children exposed to unsafe conditions.
The court rightly recognized that CBP facilities are unacceptable places to hold children for prolonged lengths of time.”","After a Los Angeles federal judge rejected the Trump administration’s bid to end a 28-year-old edict governing how immigrant children are detained, attorneys stressed Tuesday that the government remains legally obligated to promptly process, transfer, and release such children as quickly as possible.

The “Flores settlement agreement” – overseen by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California – remains one of the only legal tools to prevent the prolonged incarceration of immigrant children detained at U.S. border crossings.

Despite the required protections, attorneys for detained children have presented evidence they say shows migrant children are being subjected to “prolonged detention in punitive, prison-like conditions.”

Many are confined for weeks or even months in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities – detention sites intended only for short-term processing, where conditions are wholly inappropriate and harmful for children, the attorneys argued in court papers.

“These CBP facilities are cruel, barren, and psychologically scarring to children,” Sarah Kahn, senior staff attorney with the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, said in a statement Tuesday.

“No child should be in a prison for any amount of time. This order will help to shorten the imprisonment of children and move them promptly out of the worst and most traumatizing facilities.”

In her ruling issued Friday, Gee wrote that the government has failed “to identify any new facts or law that warrant the termination of the Flores Settlement Agreement at this time.”

Approved in 1997, the settlement, named for lead plaintiff Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old detainee when the class-action complaint was filed in 1985, requires that children be held in licensed, child-appropriate facilities, and released to family members or guardians as quickly as possible.

Under the terms of the settlement, Flores co-counsel are permitted to visit detention sites where children are being held and hear directly from them about their treatment and the duration of their detention.

Lawyers for the federal government had argued that the agreement is out of date and needed to be dissolved in order to reflect changes brought by the second Trump administration, including modifications to law, compliance, “facts,” shifts in policies and executive function.

During a hearing before Gee on Aug. 8, U.S. Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge that the Flores settlement was unusual in that it “dictates the operation of immigration law,” which should not be under the supervision of the court.

But Gee countered, “It does not dictate the operation of immigration law,” explaining that the agreement dictates the conditions of children in immigration custody. Moreover, Gee said, the government bound itself to the consent decree nearly 30 years ago.

Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.

Arguing for the plaintiffs against the government’s motion to terminate, Carlos Holguin, an attorney at the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, said the government wanted to terminate the settlement “so it can detain children for as long as it wishes … given this administration’s propensity for hardship on children.”

Joshua McCroskey, a Justice Department attorney, responded that “there have always been difficult cases where processing takes longer periods of time. … (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) does try to transfer minors out of its custody as quickly as possible.”

At the hearing, the court addressed conditions that directly affect children’s well-being, including freezing temperatures and lights that stay on all night.

Gee found that Flores co-counsel had shown the government was in “substantial noncompliance” with the agreement, leaving children exposed to unsafe conditions. She ordered that children be kept in safe, comfortable temperatures and that lights be dimmed or turned off at night so they can sleep.

“Every time I have visited a CBP border station, children and teenagers alike have described the constant frigid air that blows on them day and night while they sit in holding rooms they are not allowed to leave,” said Becky Wolozin, senior attorney with the National Center for Youth Law.

“One child told me he missed seeing the sun, and the only way he knew the time or day was by keeping track of a clock mounted on a guard surveillance station. The court rightly recognized that CBP facilities are unacceptable places to hold children for prolonged lengths of time.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICE-rally-10.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 14:57:21.440090

An Ice representative reached by telephone told the Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’s case.

Evans’s arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and Ice.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the US.

DeSantis criticizes Congress for not taking stronger action against sanctuary cities and states with lenient immigration laws.

The driver, Harjinder Singh, entered the U.S. illegally in 2018 and received a work permit in 2021.

Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to criticize California over an incident the previous week in which an undocumented immigrant with a California-issued commercial driver’s license made an illegal turn that resulted in the deaths of three people in St. Lucie County.

“It should’ve never have happened. He should never have been here,” DeSantis told reporters on Aug. 19 at an event in St. Cloud. “In Florida we’re not giving licenses if you’re here illegally.”

But he also slammed Congress for not doing enough to crack down on California and similar states and cities with what DeSantis sees as lax immigration policies.

He urged Washington lawmakers to withhold funding from states and cities with sanctuary policies and to change asylum laws to prevent illegal immigrants with frivolous asylum claims from getting work permits.

“Congress can remove funding for sanctuary cities, so stop subsidizing this,” DeSantis said. “You guys have the power of the purse. You can discipline these states that don’t follow the law.”

DeSantis’ comments come one week after he named Jay Collins, then a Republican state senator from Tampa, as his lieutenant governor, possibly setting him up for a run to replace him in 2026.

The only major declared GOP candidate for governor so far is U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Naples, who also has decried California’s issuing a license to the driver.

""(Three) innocent people were killed in St Lucie County because CA wrongly issued a driver’s license to an illegal alien. He shouldn’t have been here. He shouldn’t have received a license. THIS NEVER SHOULD’VE HAPPENED,"" Donalds posted on X on Aug. 18.

Law enforcement officials say the crash occurred when Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Pierce. Singh originally came from India and entered the U.S. illegally through the Mexico border in 2018, according the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

After being denied a work permit in 2020 under President Donald Trump’s first term administration, he was issued one in 2021 under President Joe Biden’s administration, Trump officials have said.

Driving a semi-trailer, Singh tried to use an “official use only” segment of the Turnpike to make a U-turn from the northbound outside lane, and a 2015 Chrysler minivan traveling north on the inside lane slammed into the truck, killing a 54-year-old man from Miami, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach, and a 30-year-old man from Florida City.

The Florida Highway Patrol has not released the names of the victims.

Singh has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. Dave Kerner, executive director of the DHSMV, which oversees the FHP, said Singh, who is in custody, will be deported after the conclusion of his state charges.

The Trump administration further responded on Aug. 19, with U.S. Department of Transporation Secretary Sean Duffy saying the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will investigate the incident, including White Hawk Carriers, Inc., the trucking company that hired Singh.

""This crash was a preventable tragedy directly caused by reckless decisions and compounded by despicable failures,"" Duffy said in a statement.

Developing news this afternoon as the Trump administration plans to build a new immigrant detention facility in McCook and house migrants in several county jails as part of an effort to expand capacity.

The Lincoln Journal Sar reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to open a 300-bed facility near the Work Ethic Camp in Red Willow County by as early as next month.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen is expected to announce plans for the facility Tuesday, according to several sources.

The proposed detention center is part of ICE’s plan to open or expand 125 facilities this year, more than doubling its capacity from 41,000 to more than 107,000 beds across the country.

Originally opened as a minimum-security prison for low-level offenders to free up space in Nebraska’s prisons, the Work Ethic Camp has a capacity to house up to 200 inmates.

The news of an ICE facility has largely been kept under wraps in recent weeks as other states have announced plans to open their own detention centers similar to the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades.

Pillen’s office said the governor remained “staunchly committed to keeping Americans safe, our nation’s borders secure and getting criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.”

“The governor, and his administration, continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts,” spokeswoman Laura Strimple told the Journal Star in early August. “At this time, it is premature to comment on potential detention operations.

“Gov. Pillen will make details public at the appropriate time,” Strimple added.

McCook Mayor Linda Taylor said she had not “received a whole lot of information” about the facility.

“We’re just trying to get it all figured out,” Taylor told the Journal Star on Monday.

As part of its rapid expansion of detention capacity, ICE has proposed building new tent cities, repurposing portions of military bases, and reopening dormant prisons.

The Trump administration is also seeking to partner with Republican governors and local sheriffs to free up space to house detained individuals, the Post reported.

The account accused Ortiz of ""actively impeding and doxxing"" the agents' efforts and said she should be charged.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Ortiz was ""siding with vicious cartels,"" endangering agents and weakening national security.

""This certainly looks like obstruction of justice,"" she said.

But the notion that Ortiz's speech isn't protected or obstructs justice is just ""absolutely irresponsible and lawless,"" Weinstein told The Republic.

""I think it would be a very odd definition of interfering with law enforcement to say something (Ortiz) saw in the street that she feels is illegal activity by the government, she still has an obligation to keep quiet,"" Leslie said.

It's similar to apps that alert drivers when speeding cameras or red-light cameras are ahead, Leslie and Weinstein said.

The exceptions would be if Ortiz had physically blocked or stopped ICE agents from their duties or if she had illegally obtained the information, they said.

""If you were working as a file clerk in ICE and you saw a list where the next raids would be and you posted that, that could be a crime,"" Weinstein said.

But if Ortiz hadn't played a role in the theft and instead got the information from someone else who obtained it illegally, her speech would still be protected, Weinstein said.

The First Amendment protects the disclosure of illegally intercepted information, according to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the 2000 case Bartnicki v. Hopper. A union negotiator and union president's phone call had been wiretapped by an unidentified source and leaked to a radio station, which aired the call. The union sued the radio station.

But the court said, ""a stranger's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.""

Reporting ICE agents' publicly observable duties is ""by defintion, public concern,"" Weinstein said, but without evidence or reason to think Ortiz came by the information illegally, he questioned the need for an investigation.

Nonetheless, Sen. President Warren Petersen, a Republican running for attorney general in 2026, called for a federal investigation of Ortiz. Pinal County Attorney Brad Miller, a Republican, volunteered to conduct the investigation.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes condemned Petersen and Miller, saying Ortiz's posts were protected by the First Amendment. She also suggested an investigation could run afoul of Arizona's anti-SLAPP law, meant to clamp down on strategic lawsuits against public participation.

Ortiz could assert the anti-SLAPP law as a defense if Miller were to investigate and prosecute her, Leslie said. A judge would then have to decide if Miller was trying to suppress Ortiz's protected free speech.

A federal investigation of Ortiz would be conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice or the FBI. The DOJ declined to comment when The Arizona Republic questioned whether Ortiz was under investigation, citing a policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation. The FBI had no comment when contacted by the Republic.

The Trump administration says detainees held at the site they're calling Alligator Alcatraz now will have their cases heard before immigration judges at another south Florida detention center. NPR's Greg Allen reports that immigration officials made that announcement in response to a lawsuit over the civil rights of detainees.

GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Lawyers who represent people held at the detention center in Florida's Everglades say they've been unable to meet with clients at the facility in a timely manner or in a confidential setting, and that outgoing calls by detainees are monitored and recorded. They say attorneys can't even confirm their clients are held at the facility because the federal immigration detainee locator website doesn't contain information about the Everglades site.

Their lawsuit said attorneys have been unable to determine which immigration court has jurisdiction over their clients' cases. But in a document filed over the weekend, the Trump administration notified the federal judge hearing the case that it has now designated the Krome Processing Center, another federal facility in south Florida, as the immigration court that will handle their cases. That answered one of the plaintiff's key demands, and U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz said it rendered the issue moot.

Judge Ruiz said he's still considering the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction to force the state and federal authorities to ensure detainees' rights to legal counsel are respected. Lawyers for Florida, which built and operates the facility, said there are now rooms at the Everglades site where attorneys can meet and talk with clients in a confidential setting. A lawyer for the state chalked up any delays immigration lawyers encountered in meeting with clients as a, quote, ""natural byproduct of the facility being stood up quickly."" ACLU attorney Eunice Cho said the court should not be satisfied with that answer.

EUNICE CHO: People are being held at Alligator Alcatraz in horrifying conditions. Their rights are being violated on a daily basis. And it is not acceptable for the government to say we're going to fix this later.

ALLEN: Yesterday's hearing followed proceedings last week in another lawsuit challenging operations at Alligator Alcatraz. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says he's expecting the judge in that case to rule that the hasty construction of the facility violated federal law.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RON DESANTIS: This is a political thing. We get that. But we also know that we're right on the law. And if we don't win with the trial judge, you know, we'll ultimately win going forward.

ALLEN: Last week, DeSantis announced Florida was opening a second detention center at a shuttered prison in north Florida.

Fort Bliss spans El Paso, Texas, and parts of Doña Ana and Otero counties in New Mexico.
“This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history,” the ACLU said, noting the base’s association with confining German, Italian and Japanese immigrants during World War II.
The ACLU argued the conversion of Fort Bliss exemplifies Trump’s misuse of military resources to facilitate the deportation of long-standing residents as well as newly arrived immigrants.
“President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy,” Mehta said.","WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union warned in a press release that the Trump administration will convert Fort Bliss — a military base historically tied to the mistreatment of migrant children — into one of the nation’s largest immigration detention sites, with capacity for up to 5,000 people.

Fort Bliss spans El Paso, Texas, and parts of Doña Ana and Otero counties in New Mexico. The ACLU described the plan as “the latest escalation in President Trump’s dystopian agenda to detain and deport millions of immigrants from communities nationwide.”

The organization said the detention camp will be structured as a tent facility, leaving detainees vulnerable to “extreme heat and other harsh conditions.”

Media reports have indicated that the Trump administration is prepared to spend about $1.26 billion to build the detention camp. The ACLU said Congress has also passed legislation providing $170 billion to accelerate deportations and expand detention.

“This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history,” the ACLU said, noting the base’s association with confining German, Italian and Japanese immigrants during World War II. The facility was later used from 2016 and again between 2021 and 2023 to hold unaccompanied children, many of whom suffered extreme abuse.

The ACLU argued the conversion of Fort Bliss exemplifies Trump’s misuse of military resources to facilitate the deportation of long-standing residents as well as newly arrived immigrants.

In response, Sarah Mehta, deputy director of government affairs for the ACLU, condemned the move. “President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy,” Mehta said. “Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda.”

Mehta concluded, “Members of Congress must stop the use of the military — including its bases — for the Trump administration’s reckless and wasteful deportation drive.”

A deadline to apply for new federal grants for states is Wednesday with awards expected to be announced by Sept. 30.","Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has joined two more multistate lawsuits against the Trump administration, one over proposed caps on administrative costs for renewable energy projects and another on restrictions for federal grants for victims of crime.

The suits, filed Friday and Monday, are the latest of dozens that have been filed by Democratic attorneys general and governors challenging executive actions by President Donald Trump (R) and proposed cuts enacted by federal agencies. In each of the latest cases, Maryland was one of 20 states and the District of Columbia to sue.

On Monday, the states filed suit against the U.S. Department of Justice for its proposal that would tie federal grants under the Victims of Crime Act to a state’s willingness to support what the states called the “administration’s extreme immigration enforcement efforts.”

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island asks the court to permanently stop the administration from implementing or enforcing these “illegal conditions.” In addition, the suit claims the department “literally has no power to act … unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”

“Crime victims need all the help they can get to survive traumatic, often violent experiences that can forever change their lives,” Brown said in a statement. “The administration’s unlawful attempt to withhold this critical funding undermines the ability of states to provide essential services and threatens the trust that survivors place in programs designed to help them heal and rebuild their lives.”

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for department, declined to comment Monday afternoon.

According to the suit, the department would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, about half of which would be due to the states filing suit. The federal fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.

The Victims of Crime Act was enacted by Congress in 1984 under former President Ronald Reagan (R) and is split between two funds: victim compensation and victim assistance. The compensation grant can be used for medical care, mental health counseling, funeral expenses, among other sources. Victim assistance can be used by public agencies and community organizations to assist crime victims in a particular case, which can include emergency shelter, wrap-around services and communication to victims and witnesses when a person is released from custody.

In Maryland for state fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy awarded $60.5 million in state and federal funds to 125 state, county and local offices and state and local nonprofit organizations, among others. Some of the money went to assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, legal assistance and other services.

A deadline to apply for new federal grants for states is Wednesday with awards expected to be announced by Sept. 30.

Attorneys general from Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, California and Illinois participated in a Zoom call with reporters Monday to discuss the lawsuit.

“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said, according to a story in the Rhode Island Current, a part of the States Newsroom network. “We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime. That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

The other jurisdictions in the lawsuit are the District of Columbia, and the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

Another 20 Democrat-led jurisdictions filed suit Friday in U.S. District Court in Oregon against the Department of Energy and its proposed cap on administrative and staffing costs associated with clean-energy and energy-efficiency projects.

Appeals court lifts injunction that would have blocked DOGE access to personal records

The suit said federal law has required agencies to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run energy programs, including basic administrative and staffing costs needed to run these programs. It said those costs were never capped until May 8, when DOE announced that it was capping reimbursement to the states at 10% of a project’s total budget. Any balance would fall to the states.

Brown said in a prepared statement that the suit is needed to “help our State meet its commitment to advancing clean energy, reducing harmful emissions and supporting Marylanders’ efforts to make energy improvements to their homes.”

“Maryland has set ambitious climate goals that promise a cleaner, healthier, and safer future for our children – but this short-sighted federal policy would unlawfully limit our State’s ability to support projects that are crucial to meeting those goals,” his statement said.

Oregon was the lead plaintiff in the suit, which was joined by Maryland, New York, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement to the Oregon Capital Chronicle, another member of the States Newsroom network, that Oregonians “count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean and our bills manageable.”

“This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going — and the people and expertise behind it,” Rayfield said. “We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb10_anthonybrown-newsletter-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 13:57:40.174826

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court, seeks to release more than $1 billion approved by Congress intended to go to survivors of violent crimes like rape and domestic violence under the Victims of Crime Act, also known as VOCA.

In Washington state, more than $34 million in funding for programs and compensation for victims for fiscal year 2025 is at risk of being withheld unless the state agrees to new immigration enforcement requirements, according to a statement from Attorney General Nick Brown’s office.

“Nothing is safe from the Trump administration’s political attacks—including funds to help people at their most vulnerable, after they’ve survived a crime,” Brown said.

The lawsuit is the latest legal challenge Brown has brought against the Trump administration, as it freezes millions in federal funding, dismantles government agencies and challenges constitutional rights. The state has already filed or joined more than two dozen suits against the federal government since Trump’s return to office.

Under new conditions issued by the U.S. Department of Justice in July for VOCA funding, states and recipients under state programs will not receive funding if they impede or hinder the enforcement of federal immigration law, such as failing to give immigration officials access to facilities.

The lawsuit asks the court to stop the Trump administration from enforcing the conditions, arguing the Justice Department is overstepping its statutory authority.

“Defendants’ brazen attempt to manipulate critical funding for crime victims to strong-arm States into supporting the Administration’s immigration policies runs headlong into two basic principles of American governance: separation of powers and federalism,” the complaint stated.

The Crime Victims Fund was established through VOCA, which President Ronald Reagan signed into law in 1984. Under the federal law, states can apply for funding to pay for victim compensation programs or cover services by local organizations that provide support like housing, therapy and more to crime victims.

Washington expected to receive more than $29 million to fund such support for fiscal year 2025, which ends in September, according to the attorney general’s office. That funding would go toward emergency shelters and mental health services, as well as organizations that provide resources to victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, human trafficking and child abuse. Losing the funds would likely mean cuts to those services.

Additionally, $4.8 million in benefits slated to go directly to victims of crimes is also at risk, according to the state attorney general’s office. That funding helps victims cover out-of-pocket expenses related to crimes, such as medical bills, rape kit tests, funeral costs, grief counseling and more.

“As Attorney General, public safety is one of my top priorities, and that includes ensuring the federal government makes good on its obligations to crime victims,” Brown said in a statement.

If federal VOCA funds suddenly become unavailable, the risk to victims and survivors will be immediate, said Kate Garvey, CEO of King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, in a statement.

When a victim of crime needs help, “the last thing they need is a long wait — or worse, a closed door,” she said.

Her organization, which is in part funded with federal VOCA dollars, serves about 4,500 survivors and their families annually, providing legal advocacy, counseling services and more.

“It can be a matter of life and death to a domestic violence survivor trying to exit abuse,” she said. “It might be the last time a survivor of sexual assault tries to get help if the message is ‘take a number, we’ll get back to you.’ ”

Not only are the immigration-related requirements not specified in the Victims of Crime Act, the lawsuit argues, but also they would undermine public safety efforts by creating a chilling effect among victims and witnesses who fear reporting crimes because of the possibility of deportation.

In some cases, victims of crimes eligible to receive assistance may be undocumented themselves, or have family members who are. King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, like most organizations assisting crime victims, does not track the immigration status of their clients.

“The last thing we need in terms of family stability, community well-being and public safety is for sexual assault survivors to fear the consequences of speaking out, Garvey said.

The lawsuit argues the immigration-related conditions force states into an “untenable position”: forfeit access to critical funds to support crime victims, or allow local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials and break the community trust needed to prevent and respond to crimes.

Washington passed the Keep Washington Working Act in 2019, which limits the ability of local law enforcement agencies to help federal officials arrest or deport undocumented immigrants. The law came under fire from members of Congress earlier this year.

Gov. Bob Ferguson has defended the state’s immigration policy in recent days amid threats of federal crackdowns on so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.

Driving the news: Good moral character is not a new requirement for naturalization.
But under the USCIS memo, officers are instructed to put ""greater emphasis"" on an applicants' ""positive attributes and contributions.""
Those include permanent bars to good moral character — like murder, aggravated felonies and genocide — and other offenses, like gambling and drug-related violations.
It continues, ""It entails a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.""","U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers under the Trump administration must consider the ""positive attributes"" of immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship — rather than just the absence of misconduct — according to a recent policy memo.

The big picture: The Friday USCIS memo calls for a more ""holistic"" approach to assessing the ""good moral character"" of an immigrant seeking naturalization under an administration that has cracked down on immigration and pathways to citizenship in unprecedented ways.

Driving the news: Good moral character is not a new requirement for naturalization. But under the USCIS memo, officers are instructed to put ""greater emphasis"" on an applicants' ""positive attributes and contributions.""

Those can include factors like community involvement, family caregiving and educational attainment.

""Going forward, USCIS officers must account for an alien's positive attributes and not simply the absence of misconduct,"" the memo states.

Zoom out: It also calls for heightened scrutiny of disqualifying behaviors.

Those include permanent bars to good moral character — like murder, aggravated felonies and genocide — and other offenses, like gambling and drug-related violations.

But the memo also stipulates that other disqualifying actions could include behavior that is technically lawful but is ""inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community,"" like habitual traffic infractions or solicitation.

The policy also instructs officers to consider factors that show an applicant could have demonstrated ""genuine rehabilitation,"" through actions like rectifying overdue child support or past-due taxes.

Context: The test of ""good moral character"" has in the past largely been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the disqualifying or criminal offenses detailed in U.S. immigration law, per CBS News.

But the memo says ""[e]valuating GMC involves more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.""

It continues, ""It entails a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.""

What they're saying: USCIS Spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said in a statement provided to Axios that the agency is restoring ""integrity"" in the immigration system.

""Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character,"" he said.

Catch up quick: The Trump administration has launched a sweeping spectacle cracking down on illegal immigration, but it's also significantly curtailed avenues to being in the country legally by terminating past legal protections and targeting refugee admissions.

That effort has also included heightened scrutiny of legal immigrants and those who want to study in the U.S.

Under an April policy, USCIS officials screen immigrants' social media accounts for ""antisemitic activity,"" which includes content that indicates an applicant ""endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity.""

Immigrants contribute a lot to West Virginia.
Immigrants are not causing problems in West Virginia.
Maybe it’s time Morrisey remembered that West Virginia was settled by immigrants and be grateful they still want to live here.","Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia is now participating in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which will allow the National Guard and local police to enforce certain immigration laws.

Fox News called this one of the most “wide-ranging agreements” a state has forged with ICE under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 after a Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos by an Arizona task force, Stateline reported.

Although West Virginia is nearly 1,500 miles away from the U.S. southern border, Morrisey said during a press conference that the state has “effectively become a border state.” He also blamed the people entering the country illegally for “unlimited amounts of fentanyl flooding into our state.”

The majority of fentanyl is smuggled into the country by people who can enter the U.S. legally, according to the American Immigration Council.

Fewer than half of people arrested by ICE since Trump took office are actually convicted criminals and only 5% were arrested for drug crimes nationally. So either ICE is doing a terrible job, or immigrants aren’t the problem.

The Deportation Data Project reported earlier this month that 1 in 5 ICE arrests are of Latinos with no criminal past or removal order. A substantial portion of ICE arrests this year were a result of illegal profiling. Basically, people are being arrested for having brown skin.

If your argument for ICE is that people should enter the country legally, then shouldn’t ICE be only using legal methods to arrest people?

The legal route for ICE to make an arrest would be if a suspect was arrested first by local police and found to be in the country illegally. Raiding Japanese and Mexican restaurants or hanging out at Home Depot and Lowes is not the legal way.

In July, a court in California ordered ICE to stop using these methods to arrest people in the Los Angeles area, and an appeals court upheld that order. Since then, street arrests went down by 83%.

ICE’s illegal profiling has also resulted in numerous U.S. citizens and legal immigrants being arrested.

Morrisey’s move will result in your friends, neighbors and co-workers being profiled and arrested for not passing as white. In Alabama, a man was tackled at his worksite and ICE officers said his REAL ID was fake. It wasn’t. A man in California was detained for three days, despite being a legal citizen. A woman in Los Angeles was grabbed by ICE agents moments after her family dropped her off for work — witnesses said they never even asked to see her ID.

West Virginia has a small number of immigrants — only about 2% of the population, but they also account for 18% of employees in farming, fishing and forestry occupations, and 11% in science occupations, such as microbiologists, biochemists and epidemiologists.

Immigrants contribute a lot to West Virginia. In 2023, they paid $450.3 million in taxes. And thanks to immigrants, our population loss was less severe than it would have been without them.

As of 2018, about 52% of immigrants in the Mountain State had gone through the long process to become legal U.S. citizens. And about 42% of adult immigrants had a college degree or higher that same year — compared to 19.6% of West Virginians.

There are many reasons people choose to migrate to the United States without going through the proper channels — crime, violence, war or simply to build a better life — but our immigration policy has made it harder and harder for people to immigrate here legally.

Immigrants aren’t the enemy that Trump’s administration is trying to paint them to be. Immigrants are not causing problems in West Virginia.

Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents the El Paso area, visited the site Monday for nearly 2½ hours and said migrants began being detained at the facility as early as Aug. 1 and that it now houses nearly 1,000 people. She said she is pushing federal officials to allow local officials, faith leaders and media to conduct oversight visits to the camp and observe the conditions, expressing concerns the “massive” facility is understaffed and improperly equipped to humanely house the detained migrants.

She said at a news conference that she was unable to speak to detainees but saw elderly men detained at the facility and added that, while it was just housing men for now, there are plans to hold women and potentially women with children in the future.

“We will finish construction for up to 5,000 beds in the weeks and months ahead,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said earlier this month. “Upon completion, this will be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission — the deportation of illegal aliens.""

The presently 1,000-bed tent camp officially began operations Sunday with temperatures in the mid-90s and just days after the region saw readings as high as 105 degrees. Democrats and civil rights groups are raising the alarm about the human rights conditions and lack of transparency. El Paso County Commissioner David Stout described it as a “concentration camp for migrants.”

“I have very, very many doubts about how people are going to be treated in these facilities,” Stout, a former television reporter for Telemundo and Univision, told NewsNation earlier this month. “I think we are going down the road to becoming a fascist country. I think it’s a very slippery slope, and the actions that are taking place at this point in time are comparable to [Nazi Germany].”

The American Civil Liberties Union noted that Fort Bliss housed an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II, imprisoned thousands of Mexican refugees fleeing war earlier in the century and was the site where imprisoned migrant children were separated from their parents during President Donald Trump’s first term and into President Joe Biden’s time in office. A Department of Health and Human Services inspector general’s report published in 2022 found the conditions at Fort Bliss “caused children to experience distress, anxiety, and in some cases, panic attacks” and documented cases of self-harm by children.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn said after visiting the facility last week that he was told by federal officials that “no families and no children” would be imprisoned at the camp, “just single adults.”

“We're not talking about gardeners, housekeepers or people like that,” Cornyn said. “We're talking about as many as … 291,000 individuals who are called criminal aliens, who are people either with criminal charges pending or criminal convictions, and who have exhausted all of their legal remedies.

“In other words, there's no due process issue involved here,” said Cornyn, a Republican with the backing of Senate leadership, but who faces a formidable primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

Escobar disputed Cornyn's characterization, saying that “there are folks inside the facility who have recently been apprehended, maybe even here at the border, or apprehended as far away as Miami or as far away as LA in enforcement operations that ICE is conducting inside the U.S.”

The U.S. Army bills Fort Bliss as a military installation that “proudly offers the highest standards of living within the Department of Defense” for soldiers and their families. According to the Army, about 70,000 soldiers and their family members live on the base, which is larger than the state of Rhode Island.

Federal officials, the Pentagon and Republicans touted the new detention camp as vital to Trump’s goal of rounding up and deporting millions of migrants, framing the vast majority of those imprisoned and deported as dangerous and criminals, though federal data released publicly shows the vast majority have no criminal conviction and only about 12% of those deported between January and May were convicted of violent crimes or crimes that could be considered potentially violent, according to the Marshall Project.

Trump’s signature taxes and spending legislation signed into law in July and nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” included $45 billion for immigrant detention facilities and more than $170 billion total for immigration and border enforcement. Bloomberg and Military.com reported the Fort Bliss facility will cost at least $1.26 billion to construct.

The new camp is already under investigation by an independent government watchdog for the process its contracts were awarded to private companies, the Army confirmed to NBC News. And a 38-year-old worker, Hector Gonzalez, employed by a subcontractor on the project died in a workplace accident in July, the company Disaster Management Group said. The Army is investigating the circumstances.

The camp, officially known as Camp East Montana and dubbed “Lone Star Lockup” by Cornyn, has drawn comparisons to the similarly outrage-inducing “Alligator Alcatraz” tent camp in Florida where the ACLU, detainees and detainees' lawyers have reported abuse, unsanitary and unsafe conditions, and unconstitutional restrictions of migrants’ legal rights — claims the Department of Homeland Security has denied.

During his visit to Fort Bliss last week, Cornyn did not actually go inside the tent camp — “We saw it from a distance” — but assured the public, “These are humane, safe facilities, and in many instances, a vast improvement over what many of these folks are used to.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/US_Deportation_Flights_AP,N,,2025-08-19 12:58:25.148399

The White House is reportedly preparing to cap the U.S. refugee admissions at 40,000 for fiscal year 2026, with a striking three‑quarters of these slots—approximately 30,000 places—earmarked specifically for white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners. This represents not only a sharp reduction from the 100,000 refugees admitted under the Biden administration in fiscal year 2024 but also a notable increase from the Trump-era cap of 15,000 in 2021.

This figure stems from internal discussions, including an email from Angie Salazar, the senior refugee program official at the Department of Health and Human Services, which outlined the allocation during internal coordination efforts. However, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly cautioned that no decisions are final and that any refugee cap—including this proposed figure—is speculative until confirmed before the fiscal year begins on October 1.

The policy would mark a dramatic exception in U.S. refugee policy: while most refugee admissions remain frozen or sharply cut, this plan would fast‑track cases for a single demographic group—white South Africans. Earlier this year, a similar directive resulted in the first group of approximately 49–59 Afrikaner individuals arriving as refugees in the U.S., a move facilitated via an executive order that invoked claims of racial persecution and land confiscation as justification.

This planned allocation has stirred considerable backlash. In a June poll by Yahoo News/YouGov, while 61% of Americans supported accepting refugees generally, only 36% supported giving special priority to Afrikaners. Opposition rose sharply (52%) when this group was fast‑tracked ahead of others included in the broader refugee process.

The Episcopal Church, speaking out strongly against the policy, announced its withdrawal from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, stating the Trump administration’s preferential treatment of white South Africans contradicted its commitment to racial justice. At the same time, the U.N. stated that no South Africans met international refugee criteria last year. Meanwhile, South Africa has rejected claims of targeted persecution, with President Cyril Ramaphosa denouncing the underlying premise as factually baseless and politically motivated.

The focus on Afrikaners coincides with intensified U.S. criticism of human rights practices in South Africa. Drafts of the State Department’s annual human rights reports, reviewed by The Washington Post, signal a shift—highlighting alleged ‘genocide’ and persecution of Afrikaners while omitting or downplaying issues in other countries. Critics—ranging from human rights advocates to foreign leaders—have condemned this move as politicized and aimed at reshaping global narratives.

As the federal government evaluates refugee allocations ahead of the new fiscal year, the proposed plan to prioritize white South Africans looms as one of most contentious immigration policy shifts of the Trump administration so far. With global refugee crises ongoing and calls for humanitarian consistency mounting, officials face mounting pressure to justify such a targeted approach—both within domestic politics and on the international stage.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation.
But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies.
The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.","The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.

The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.

Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.

One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”

“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”

Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.

Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.

“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Council member Brianne Nadeau wants people living and visiting her diverse community to be aware of their legal rights if they’re stopped by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal law agencies during the recent surge.

In a Monday virtual town hall, Nadeau, who represents Ward 1, said she wanted to provide some answers and conversation about the recent federal actions by the Trump administration, after the president announced he was invoking section 740 of the Home Rule Act, which Mayor Muriel Bowser characterizes as a surge in federal law enforcement.

The virtual meeting included guidance from Emily Cassometus, an assistant professor of law and director of legislation clinics at the University of the District of Columbia’s School of Law.

While not providing legal advice, she provided general guidance on a person’s rights if a federal law enforcer knocked on their door or stopped them in a public area.

If a person is at home, “The first thing we need to do is ask them, ‘Do you have a warrant?’ If they don’t have a warrant, you do not have to open the door, and you do not have to let anyone in,” said Cassometus.

If the officer says they have a warrant, “You should ask them to slide it under the door and check the details on the warrant.” Cassometus said a legal warrant should be specific to the address, and include “either the things or the people that the warrant is for, and it should be signed by a judge.”

If the warrant has that specificity, Cassometus said you should open the door, “or they’ll let themselves in.”

What about in a public area?

If stopped in a public area, Cassometus said a person should ask if they are free to go.

“If you’re stopped in a car, on a bus, on the sidewalk, ask the officer, ‘Am I free to go?’ If they say yes, leave. Don’t stick around to ask more questions. Just leave. Leave calmly, but please leave.”

If the answer is no, Cassometus said a person should say “I do not consent to a search.”

And, finally, “The third phrase is ‘Am I under arrest?'” If the answer is yes, a person should expect to be handcuffed and taken into custody.

If the answer is no, “Say ‘Am I free to go?’, and leave as quickly as possible,” said Cassometus.

Cassometus said to protect your rights, “You need to be very specific: I want to speak to a lawyer.”

And if you choose to remain silent, “you must actually remain silent. You cannot talk to anyone about anything, or they will use that as an excuse to ask questions.”

What bystanders can do

Cassometus, Nadeau and Samantha Davis with the Free DC group, which supports Home Rule, said concerned bystanders should witness and document when someone is being taken into custody.

“You, as a bystander, can ask to see that warrant, too,” said Nadeau. “And you can videotape, and you can ask questions, and you can ask the names of the officers, and you can ask for the names of the people who are being taken, so that we can all assist, further.”

After videotaping a person being taken into custody, Cassometus suggests sharing the video with a legal aid group, who can help protect the person’s rights.

Products like steel, copper, lithium, caustic soda and red dates coming from China are now designated ""high priority"" for inspection and will come under the microscope by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in line with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).

Caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide, is an industrial chemical used in everything from aluminum production, paper-making, textiles and soap to petroleum refining. Red dates, a fruit grown in China, are often dried and used in teas and snacks.

""The use of slave labor is repulsive, and we will hold Chinese companies accountable for abuses and eliminate threats its forced labor practices pose to our prosperity,"" Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

CUSTOMS BUSTS $400M TRADE DUTY-EVASION RING INVOLVING CHINA AND OTHERS

As of Aug. 1, CBP has stopped 16,700 shipments, worth around $3.7 billion, for further examination under the UFLPA Congress passed in 2022. Of those, around 10,000 shipments worth almost $900 million have been turned away.

Some 144 entities are listed on an entity list under the UFLPA as using slave labor in their supply chains, in sectors like agriculture, batteries, electronics, food additives, metals, plastics and textiles.

President Donald Trump has already placed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, arguing that foreign nations were flooding the U.S. market with cheap, subsidized products and jeopardizing national security by making the U.S. reliant on foreign sources for such products.

Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in 2022 with broad bipartisan support, targeting goods made wholly or in part with forced labor from China’s Xinjiang region.

CHINA APPEARS TO BE BUILDING 'LEVERAGE' TO USE AGAINST FOREIGN ENTITIES

The law operates on a ""rebuttable presumption,"" meaning that any product connected to Xinjiang or listed entities is assumed to involve forced labor unless companies can prove otherwise. Rights groups and U.S. officials say the Chinese government has detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in camps, where many are subjected to indoctrination, surveillance and forced labor. Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them fabrications designed to contain China’s rise.

Initially focused on apparel, cotton, tomatoes and polysilicon used in solar panels, enforcement under UFLPA has steadily widened. DHS and CBP have been expanding the scope of ""high-priority sectors"" subject to strict scrutiny as evidence mounts of forced labor practices in a broader range of supply chains.

The illegal migrant faces three counts of vehicular homicide.","The illegal migrant truck driver who allegedly killed three people after making a rogue U-turn on a Florida highway was handed work papers under the Biden administration after they were denied during President Trump’s first term, the Department of Homeland Security said Monday.

Harjinder Singh crossed the southern border into California in September 2018 and was processed for fast-track deportation by the first Trump administration, sources told The Post.

The Indian national was previously processed for deportation, but was able to stay after claiming he feared being sent back home. Singh was later released on a $5,000 immigration bond in January 2019 and still awaits a decision on his asylum case.

After receiving his work permit in June 2021, Singh was able to secure a Commercial Driver’s License in California, according to DHS.

On Monday, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin hit back at an X post from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office after it accused the Trump administration of issuing the work permit and either “lying” or acting “clueless” about it.

“False. Harjinder Singh is in the United States illegally and his work authorization was rejected under the Trump Administration on September 14, 2020. It was later approved under the Biden Administration June 9, 2021,” said McLaughlin.

“The state of California issues Commercial Drivers Licenses. There is no national CDL. Sincerely, Genius,” she concluded.

US Marshals in California nabbed Singh on Saturday on a warrant for three counts of vehicular homicide in connection with the deadly crash in Florida at around 3 p.m. last Thursday.

Singh allegedly made a hard left turn while driving a tractor-trailer on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Pierce and attempted to cross the median through an “Official Use Only” pass, authorities said.

The trailer blocked all lanes of oncoming traffic when a minivan slammed into it at full speed. The victims’ vehicle became wedged underneath the trailer, killing a 37-year-old Pompano Beach woman, a 30-year-old Florida City man and a 54-year-old Miami man, Treasure Coast Newspapers reported.

The two passengers died at the scene, and the driver was transported to a local hospital, where he was later pronounced deceased.

Neither Singh nor his passenger was injured, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

Shocking video taken inside the truck cab showed Singh seemingly unfazed at the moment of the crash as he calmly put the vehicle into park and turned off the engine.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer for Singh so they can move to deport him while ensuring he remains in custody. The illegal migrant faces three counts of vehicular homicide.

“The actions taken by the Defendant while operating a commercial tractor-trailer are both shocking and criminal, FLHSMV Director Dave Kerner said.

“Three people lost their lives as a result of his recklessness, and countless friends and family members will experience the pain of their loss forever.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/109776264-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-19 14:57:38.865940

Shortly after the immigration white paper was published, two petitions against the doubling of the settlement period from five to ten years in two specific routes hit the 100,000 threshold required for the government to consider holding a debate on the issue. Keeping the five year route to settlement in the skilled worker and Hong Kong BN(O) routes will be the subject of a Westminster Hall debate on 8 September 2025. The House of Commons library have published a briefing ahead of the debate.

I mentioned this in the newsletter earlier this year, but the US State Department has published its “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices” and these are no longer reliable, which means that extreme caution should be exercised when relying on them. In light of these extremely serious concerns, it will be important to monitor whether or not the Home Office continues to reference the reports in its country policy and information notes. If they do, this will need to be checked and challenged where appropriate.

The Unity Project has published its latest analysis of the Home Office data on change of conditions applications submitted by people who need to have the no recourse to public funds restriction lifted from their grant of leave. There has been a significant increase in Home Office decision making, leading to a decrease in the backlog of applications, however success rates have dropped significantly. On the same topic, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has recently published a report looking at the dire situation and hardship experienced by families who are subject to the condition.

On Free Movement, today Niamh Fegan takes a look at some common issues that arise with bail conditions. Last week I updated our briefing on the inadmissibility process in asylum applications, given it is once again relevant in light of the new UK/France returns agreement.

There were several cases covered on the blog, including an appeal against an Immigration Advice Authority decision, an Afghan driver who unsuccessfully challenged the refusal of his resettlement application, and a successful procedural fairness challenge in a Hong Kong application.

U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz issued the decision late Monday, writing in a 47-page ruling that claims the detainees at the facility don’t have confidential access to their lawyers or to hearings in immigration court were rendered moot when the Trump administration recently designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for their cases to be heard.

The judge heard arguments from both sides in a hearing earlier Monday in Miami. Civil rights civil rights attorneys were seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure detainees at the facility have access to their lawyers and can get a hearing.

The state and federal government had argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility is located is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district was the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district.

Judge Ruiz had hinted during a hearing last week that he had some concerns over which jurisdiction was appropriate.

The state and federal government defendants made an identical argument last week about jurisdiction for a second lawsuit in which environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued to stop further construction and operations at the Everglades detention center until it’s in compliance with federal environmental laws.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week. She had yet to rule on the venue question.

While federally driven, these policies – if they discourage tax filing, reduce federal financial support, and remove economic contributors from communities – could strain the finances of many states and localities.

Discouraging tax filing

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (PL 119-21) limits tax benefits for families with mixed immigration status – where some members are US citizens and others are not – as well as families with all undocumented members. For example, the child tax credit (CTC) will now require both the qualifying child and at least one parent to have Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which undocumented immigrants cannot obtain.

Contrary to some perceptions, an estimated 5.4 million undocumented immigrants pay taxes using individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs). But if their households lose eligibility for key tax benefits, they may become less likely to file. This will impact US citizens too: an estimated 2.7 million US citizen children live in single- or two-parent households where the parents are undocumented.

Additionally, the Trump Administration’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has asked the Treasury Department to deputize special agents in the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) division to help DHS with deportations. And, in April, the IRS and DHS reached a memorandum of understanding that allows the IRS to provide taxpayer information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Several high-ranking IRS officials have resigned or been placed on leave over their objections to the data sharing. As of August 12th, court filings confirm that the IRS has responded to requests for tax filers' information.

Taken together, the loss of federal tax benefits and fear of being targeted or deported may reduce tax filing by undocumented immigrants and mixed-status families. One independent estimate suggests that the IRS information-sharing alone could cost the federal government $147 to $479 billion over the next 10 years.

At the state and local level, the net fiscal impacts are more complex because there are key considerations of how the costs of public goods are allocated and what time periods or generations to consider. However, many estimates suggest that in the long term, immigrants overall pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits compared with native-born Americans.

Reducing federal financial support

President Trump signed two executive orders in January and April to withhold federal money from “sanctuary” cities, counties, and states, which broadly refer to those that may limit immediate cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Federal grants comprise a significant share of state and local revenues, and billions of dollars are at stake in federal funding allocated for states and localities across the country.

The courts are currently debating the legality of these orders. In further attempts to pressure those jurisdictions, the federal government is suing many, with ongoing cases in California, Chicago, Denver, the state of Colorado, Rochester, New York, and others.

Removing economic contributors from communities

Immigration helps national and local economies in myriad ways. As of 2022, there were 8.3 million undocumented immigrants working in the US, with large shares in construction (1.5 million), restaurants (1 million), agriculture and farms (320,000), landscaping (300,000), and food processing and manufacturing (200,000).

If undocumented immigrants find it challenging to continue working their jobs (due to employers’ reluctance in hiring them or out of fear of being deported while at their jobs, for example), or if they feel compelled to shift to informal labor markets, those industries would be especially vulnerable. President Trump implied as much when he announced an exemption for farms and hotels from immigration raids, though the Administration reversed course shortly after.

Recent evidence suggests a large reduction in undocumented immigrants’ labor could also lead to job losses and worse working conditions for US-born employees, especially in fields like construction or child care. Jobs held by immigrant workers and US-born workers tend to be complementary: for example, with fewer immigrant roofers available, there will be fewer jobs available for US-born electricians and plumbers.

Immigrants contribute to their communities through deep social ties as well. As immigration enforcement efforts ramp up, local communities across the US have been reckoning with both the economic consequences and the community impacts.

What this could mean for state and local governments

Altogether, if enforced to the fullest extent, federal immigration actions may push out many undocumented immigrants as well as an estimated 4.7 million mixed-status families with US citizens, and those who remain may find it challenging to file their federal or state-level tax returns or be forced to find informal employment and housing.

There are some early warning signs. Worries about detention and deportation have risen sharply among all immigrants, including lawfully present immigrants and naturalized citizens. This stress is taking a toll on their health; they are withdrawing from day-to-day activities like driving to work or seeking medical care. Delayed care could put stress on hospitals, with long-term financial impacts for states and localities.",https://taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_768x256/public/2025-08/getty-images-CDpgDB2YfbA-unsplash.jpeg?h=0047ab37&itok=H5b6VLse,N,,2025-08-19 13:57:53.829771

“People forget that public officials are human beings.” Whether anyone disagreed with Paris does not justify abuse and harassment, he said.","The timing and reach of a social media post accusing a Connecticut state lawmaker of impeding federal immigration agents are drawing the FBI, state police and Capitol police to assess the threat posed by the resulting deluge of abuse.

It is the latest and highest-profile example of what House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford says is is an all-too-common drill: divining the differences between political speech, harassment and credible criminal threats.

“That line can be very small and thin at times,” said Ritter, who estimates that half of all lawmakers will need threat assessments in any given two-year term. “We have a protocol in place.”

The shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers on June 14 had lawmakers on edge long before “@LibsofTikTok,” a right-wing poster with 4.3 million followers on X, urged federal charges against Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.

Three days ago, it accused him of divulging, in an Instagram post, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ “live location and warning illegals to stay ‘vigilant.’ He’s helping illegals evade arrest and impeding ICE. Charge him.”

It was reposted a day later by the official ICE account, tagging the Justice Department account. That was enough for “@LibsofTikTok” to proclaim Sunday that ICE had referred Paris for prosecution.

Paris did not identify any locations where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were gathered, instead sharing unverified reports that ICE agents were active in his House district.

“While we are still working to verify the full scope of these reports, I urge all residents to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety,” Paris wrote in his post.

The @LibsofTikTok critique was viewed 970,000 times, a number amplified by other reposts. The reaction over the weekend was furious and abusive, much of it racist, friends said.

Paris is Black.

“I think the dehumanization of public officials is horrifying — and coming out of what happened in Minnesota is particularly concerning,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.

Candelora returned Monday morning on a red-eye flight from Los Angeles, where he was attending a small bipartisan legislative conference. One of the attendees was a friend of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic legislative leader killed in Minnesota. Her husband also was killed, and a second lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded in a separate attack the same night.

“Her life is changed forever. I’ve gone to several conferences with her,” Candelora said. “People forget that public officials are human beings.”

Whether anyone disagreed with Paris does not justify abuse and harassment, he said.

Candelora said even before the incident with Paris that state legislators in Connecticut were removing legislative plates from their motor vehicles because they feared being identified.

One anonymous caller to Paris’ cell phone said his life and family connections were known and being distributed widely, a chilling claim, said other lawmakers.

The call was recorded by Paris’s fiancée. They were together in his car when his phone rang, and she answered. She used her phone to record it. A copy was provided to the Connecticut Mirror.

“You’re messing with someone that was a subcontractor for the NSA, you stupid [expletive] idiot,” the caller said. “This content is being replicated and duplicated all across Christian networks, all across Trump supporters, MAGA supporters and right wing newspapers.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Christine Bartlett-Josie, a political consultant and family friend of Paris, said the FBI has a copy of the recorded call and is investigating, as are the Capitol and state police.

“It is unfortunate and alarming to be wrongfully targeted by a federal agency and even called for arrest by the DOJ,” Paris said in a statement released by the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. “However, my commitment to compassion, courage, and community — and my refusal to be silenced when the safety of my neighbors is at stake — will never be shaken.”

Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said angry calls and emails come with the job, but what Paris is experiencing is of another scale — as is the role of a federal law enforcement agency in fueling the abuse.

“The federal government should be a place that you go to protect yourself when you’re facing these attacks, not a place that amplifies them and calls people against you,” he said.

Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, a Black and Puerto Rican Caucus member who is accustomed to online abuse as the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over hot-button issues such as gun control, said it has become unwise to dismiss harassment as merely offensive words.

Winfield spent time with Paris, reviewing the threats.

“Some of these folks seem unhinged,” Winfield said. “It’s been a crazy day and a half.”

Like the anonymous caller, many made clear they know where to find Paris and people in his immediate circle.

“There may not be a direct threat, but there is an implied threat,” Winfield said.

Candelora, the Republican leader, agreed.

“That is the danger of social media. It brings everyone into your living room,” he said. “You don’t know.”

Candelora said the accused shooter in Minnesota did not have any direct contact with his victim.

“It was random,” he said. “It was evil.”

While the focus of Monday's discussion was on halting illegal entry of immigrants, several speakers acknowledged the role immigrants play in supplying the U.S. workforce.
""Calling people illegal and referring to people as illegal is very demeaning,"" he said.","LAYTON — A contingent of Republican leaders from Utah gathered Monday to parse the complex immigration issue, recognizing the varied problems that come from illegal immigration and lauding President Donald Trump's focus on the topic.

Still, a comprehensive solution may not be in the offing anytime soon.

Jamie Renda, of Path Forward Utah, said resolving the issue can't be solely the duty of elected lawmakers, which spurred her efforts to organize the event. Monday's forum is the first of three for her Ogden-based organization, which promotes conservative voices and viewpoints within minority communities, plans to foster debate on the topic. ""We need to take ownership of helping our neighbors find those solutions and have the difficult conversations to move forward,"" said Renda.

Potential fixes to tackle the immigration issue, she said, will be the focus of future forums, though Monday's participants — who included U.S. Rep. Mike Kennedy and Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz — broached possibilities, notably the need for federal officials to take action.

Kennedy, a Republican and Utah's 3rd District congressman, said there's no lack of ideas to help resolve the immigration issue, long a focus of debate among U.S. lawmakers, just a lack of political will. He also pointed to insufficient efforts by some immigrants to remedy their situations.

There are plenty of potential solutions to allow ""contributing"" immigrants to ""come out of the shadows,"" he said. ""But I need Democrats and Republican colleagues to help me with that. And at this point, it still continues to be a political football with unwilling participants on both sides to actually do something about this.""

Meantime, he voiced support for increased moves under the Trump administration to detain and deport immigrants here illegally, particularly those with criminal backgrounds. Asked about detention and deportation of immigrants here illegally who otherwise abide by the law — which has prompted an outcry from some critics — he said the onus is on them to seek a means to remain legally.

""I know we all benefit from a lot of these people, but the reality is they've had sometimes years, if not decades, to go through some legal process and at least try,"" said Kennedy, a Republican who represents Utah's 3rd District. If an immigrant has lived here for many years ""and never done anything to formalize your status, it's final exam time, and you may find yourself being deported.""

Schultz, a Republican from Hooper, favors moves to improve the immigration system but pointed to federal lawmakers as the sticking point.

""If you want to come to the United States of America and you're willing to work, you're willing to put forth the effort, then there needs to be a pathway,"" Schultz said. ""For whatever reason, Congress has not come together and created a pathway to citizenship, and so what you're having is the cartels step forward, find ways to sneak people across the border.""

U.S. Rep. Blake Moore, who also took part, made the case for passage of House Resolution 2 as proposed in 2023 to address the immigration issue. Even if some elements would potentially have to be removed to get enough votes for passage, it would be a start. The multipronged proposal, sponsored by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, addresses border security, hiring of immigrants and more.

""I'll take whatever percentage of HR2 that I can get done, and we'll keep working on the rest,"" Moore said.

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group, helped sponsor the event, and Kevin Greene, director of the group's Utah chapter, said moves by the Trump administration to secure the border allow for forward movement on the issue. The forum, also co-hosted by Weber State University's Olene S. Walker Institute of Politics and Public Service, was held at the college's campus in Layton.

With the strides under Trump in halting illegal crossings into the country via the U.S.-Mexico border, ""we can have a conversation on what we do to fix the system as is,"" Greene said. ""How do we make it so people who want to come here can come here legally, not wait 10, 15, 20, 30 years?""

Heightened efforts under Trump to detain and deport immigrants here illegally — a point of public debate nationwide — was a central talking point as well, with broad support from many of those on hand for the president's efforts. Numerous Republican members of the Utah Legislature attended, as well as some local elected officials and others.

""The border is secure,"" Kennedy said, referencing increased border enforcement and other actions by Trump. ""The next step is legal immigration.""

Renda noted the complexity of the issue, underscored by the need of some labor sectors for immigrant labor, and also stressed the need ""to take race out of this conversation."" While critics may rail against the ongoing immigration crackdown as ""racist"" given the ethnicity of many facing deportation, she said about three-quarters of immigrants in the country illegally are Latinos and called for understanding of ""the dynamics of who's here.""

While the focus of Monday's discussion was on halting illegal entry of immigrants, several speakers acknowledged the role immigrants play in supplying the U.S. workforce. Luis Lopez, for one, a former member of the Ogden City Council and founder of the Ogden branch of Latinos United Promoting Education and Civic Engagement, a Latino advocacy group, said the ""vast majority"" of immigrants in the country are ""good, hardworking people.""

Himself a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Mexico, Lopez, a member of the audience, said he favors efforts to remove criminal immigrants in the country illegally, but bristles at the use of the word ""illegals"" as an all-encompassing word for immigrants.

To be sure, international students aren’t the only — or biggest — immigrant community.
Some international students are afraid to apply to college, afraid to leave for a distant campus or afraid to come to the U.S. at all.
International students not only bring skill and ambition — they bring real dollars to California.
The roughly 141,000 international students in California spent $6.4 billion in 2023, supporting 55,000 jobs, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators.","The first time I got on a plane was for a flight from Delhi, India to JFK Airport in New York. I came to the United States as a student, first to the University of Illinois, and after earning my master’s degree, to California, where I’ve lived ever since. I’ve built businesses, hired people and created a life here.

My story is the story of countless others who came to America to study, work and build. My roommate in graduate school, Arvind Krishna, is now the CEO of IBM. Millions of others have come to California and gone on to create lives and opportunities.

To be sure, international students aren’t the only — or biggest — immigrant community. Earlier this summer, I attended my niece’s graduation from UC San Diego and visited Chicano Park, where large murals adorn an outdoor cathedral to community activism, celebrating millions of immigrants whose labor and creativity built California.

That’s what makes today’s news so hard to watch. As the founder of a college counseling service, I have a front-row seat to a wave of recent federal policies reshaping education.

Recently the Supreme Court let the U.S Department of Education lay off thousands of employees, causing delays in processing financial aid, slowing civil rights investigations and presenting challenges for communities.

That’s just the latest blow. There have been cuts to research funding, a wave of new visa hurdles and efforts to dismantle diversity and inclusion initiatives that help underrepresented students. And, of course, recent ICE raids have disrupted long-settled immigrant communities in cities like Los Angeles.

I’ve seen the ripple effects in my work. Some international students are afraid to apply to college, afraid to leave for a distant campus or afraid to come to the U.S. at all.

Many of the students I counsel are immigrants or the children of immigrants. One college-bound student’s mother is from Vietnam and worked in a nail salon in Oakland. The student, while still in high school, handled the family’s taxes, filled out forms and held down a job.

She also earned a full scholarship. After she finishes her education, I’m confident she’ll make a remarkable contribution to the world.

One student, whose parents emigrated from India, went to UC Berkeley on a scholarship after developing an app to detect “forever chemicals” in their community’s water supply. Another student, whose parents came from Mexico to build a life in Southern California, is now in a nursing program at Cal State Fullerton.

There are thousands of these stories across the state. Each young person holds the potential to shape our future, to become the next great leader, innovator or healer.

International students not only bring skill and ambition — they bring real dollars to California.

The roughly 141,000 international students in California spent $6.4 billion in 2023, supporting 55,000 jobs, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators. At public universities like UC and CSU, these students’ higher tuition helps fund financial aid and services for residents.

More broadly, immigrant households contribute $715 billion, or about a third of the state’s gross domestic product. Undocumented Californians alone pay about $8.5 billion a year in state and local taxes.

Much of the commentary about recent policy changes rightly focuses on the cruelty, but these measures harm all of us.

California’s strength comes from its immigrant communities. Our leadership in science, technology, agriculture, and the arts depends on students, scholars, and workers from around the world.

To protestors fighting to preserve immigrant rights and opportunity, your fight is our fight. To those who think this doesn’t affect you, I promise it will. It touches your economy and your children’s future. And to leaders advancing these policies in Washington and elsewhere — stop before California and America lose the very strengths that built them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050625-TurnitinAICollege-JAH-CM-02.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-19 09:56:20.798911

Thanks to Flores and this ruling, immigrant children are better protected today than they were just days ago.","LOS ANGELES — After rejecting the federal government’s efforts to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement last Friday, a federal court on Monday reaffirmed that the government remains legally obligated to promptly process, transfer, and release immigrant children as expeditiously as possible.

Despite these clear protections, Flores co-counsel has documented alarming evidence that children are being subjected to prolonged detention in punitive, prison-like conditions. Many are confined for weeks or even months in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, detention sites intended only for short-term processing, where conditions are wholly inappropriate and harmful for children.

“These CBP facilities are cruel, barren, and psychologically scarring to children,” said Sarah Kahn, Senior Staff Attorney with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “No child should be in a prison for any amount of time. This order will help to shorten the imprisonment of children and move them promptly out of the worst and most traumatizing facilities.”

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee acknowledged this reality, ruling that “CBP facilities are intended only for short-term use” and ordering that children be detained there only for the time “reasonably require[d] to process [them] for release and/or actively arrange for and complete transport … to a more suitable facility,” noting that CBP facilities “by design, are not suitable for [children] for long periods of time.”

“The district court’s ruling underscores the critical role of the Flores Settlement Agreement in protecting the safety and welfare of children in government custody,” said Leecia Welch, Deputy Litigation Director at Children’s Rights. “In our role as Flores counsel, we will continue to lift up the voices of imprisoned children and hold the government accountable for their humane treatment. Without court oversight, children in immigration custody would be left entirely at the mercy of a government that has consistently betrayed them.”

The Court also addressed conditions that directly affect children’s well-being: freezing temperatures and lights that stay on all night. Judge Gee found that Flores co-counsel had shown the government was in “substantial noncompliance” with the Flores Agreement, leaving children exposed to unsafe conditions. She ordered that children be kept in safe, comfortable temperatures and that lights be dimmed or turned off at night so they can sleep. These practices are deliberate government failures aimed at increasing the suffering of immigrant children and their families, leaving them cold, exhausted, and deeply vulnerable.

“Every time I have visited a CBP border station, children and teenagers alike have described the constant frigid air that blows on them day and night while they sit in holding rooms they are not allowed to leave,” said Becky Wolozin, Senior Attorney with the National Center for Youth Law. “One child told me he missed seeing the sun, and the only way he knew the time or day was by keeping track of a clock mounted on a guard surveillance station. The Court rightly recognized that CBP facilities are unacceptable places to hold children for prolonged lengths of time.”

This ruling underscores the ongoing power of the Flores Settlement Agreement to protect children in immigration custody. In place since 1997, the Flores Agreement holds the government accountable for ensuring immigrant children are processed, transferred, and released promptly. Thanks to Flores and this ruling, immigrant children are better protected today than they were just days ago.

The law emerged after a report from Reagan’s 1982 Task Force on Victims of Crime said that the “neglect of crime victims is a national disgrace,” according to Monday’s lawsuit.","Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday filed California’s 39th lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging new immigration enforcement requirements it placed on federal funding for crime victims.

States were set to receive more than $1.2 billion in federal crime victim funding this year, with California expected to claim $165 million. But last month, the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Victims for Crime announced that states must agree to support and assist the Department of Homeland Security with federal immigration enforcement in order to access those funds.

Some states view that condition as unworkable and the potential loss of funding could be the second significant hit this year from the Trump administration to California programs that support crime victims. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department slashed grants for violence prevention and victim service programs that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million.

“Congress has never put civil immigration enforcement conditions on this funding because it has nothing to do with immigration. This is a brazen abuse of the president’s power,” Bonta said at a Monday press conference about the latest lawsuit.

California and 20 other states are suing the Trump administration over the potential cut in the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. The states want the courts to prevent the Department of Justice from implementing the new rules.

The contested funding for crime victims supports expenses such as emergency shelter, sexual assault medical support, compensation for lost wages and funeral expenses.

The lawsuit says the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by going around Congress on how a program it created should be funded. The lawsuit also alleges that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that is the subject of most of the lawsuits California has filed against the White House. The act says that a federal agency needs to follow procedures and explain its rationale for changing a policy.

The states allege that the Department of Justice “arbitrarily relied on immigration-related factors that Congress did not authorize it to rely on in allocating federal grant monies to support victims.”

Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said during the press conference that the Department of Justice’s new rules go against his values. He gave the example of a child who’s the victim of sexual assault being interviewed at a child advocacy center. “One question that should not be asked is whether that child is in this country lawfully or unlawfully,” he said.

The crime act fund was signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The law emerged after a report from Reagan’s 1982 Task Force on Victims of Crime said that the “neglect of crime victims is a national disgrace,” according to Monday’s lawsuit. Among the report’s recommendations was to “enact legislation to provide federal funding to assist state crime victim compensation programs.”

In May, California filed two other lawsuits against the Trump administration for tying immigration enforcement to transportation and counter-terrorism funding, affecting billions of dollars in federal support.

Border Patrol worked with Romulus police Here's what happened to Alexa after she was arrested, according to her attorneys and advocates.
In a statement to the Free Press, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which Border Patrol is part of, strongly denied the claims of mistreatment.
The spokesperson said Romulus police contacted Border Patrol for help ""with identifying one subject they had in custody.""
Alexa uses she/her pronouns but was referred to as they/them by the Border Patrol spokesperson.","Alexa, a trans immigrant, was detained by Border Patrol after a traffic stop by Romulus police.

Federal and county officials deny Alexa was mistreated.

The case illustrates the unique problems LGBTQ+ immigrants face while in custody.

On a Friday in June, Alexa was driving her Ford Focus on Interstate 94 when a Romulus police officer pulled her over for allegedly speeding. Instead of just writing the Ypsilanti woman a ticket, police took her to the police station and contacted Border Patrol, who then took the immigrant from Honduras to the Gibraltar station of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Despite having no criminal record, she was held for eight days in a cell where the lights remained on 24 hours day, making sleep almost impossible, and she was not allowed to shower, her attorney Ruby Robinson said.

Things got worse for Alexa, a trans woman, after she was transferred to a county jail in southwestern Ohio where, she alleges, she faced groping and an attempted assault after she was denied a request to be housed with other female inmates. The Spanish-speaking inmate was also mistakenly assumed to be suicidal when asked questions in English and denied her hormonal treatment that some trans people take, which led to health problems, Robinson said.

A CBP spokesman and Butler County (Ohio) Chief Deputy Sheriff Anthony Dwyer told the Free Press she was not mistreated and they do not have reports she was abused or discriminated against. ""There was no record of an incident,"" Dwyer said. An immigration judge has denied her attorney's requests for her to be freed on bond while her case is being heard.

The case of Alexa illustrates the unique challenges that trans immigrants are facing as the administration of President Donald Trump vows to carry out a record number of arrests and deportations, according to immigrant and LGBTQ+ advocates. In addition to the crackdown on immigrants, Trump issued an executive order in January restricting gender-affirming care in prisons that affects some immigration detention centers. Alexa's challenges have alarmed civil rights and immigrant advocates in Michigan, who say it's part of a growing pattern.

""It's definitely very worrisome,"" said Robinson, with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. ""A major concern, both for her and for other individuals, is getting the appropriate gender-affirming care that they deserve. Everyone deserves appropriate and sufficient care. We all deserve human dignity in all interactions and … that's not happening.""

Alexa was born in Honduras and entered the U.S. without authorization, but has no criminal record since entering, Robinson said. She was not convicted of the alleged speeding she was pulled over for in June. The Trump administration has said they're going after all unauthorized immigrants, regardless of whether they've committed crimes. Alexa, who doesn't have legal permission to stay in the U.S., falls into that category of immigrants who may have previously been allowed to stay, but now face removal. The Free Press did not speak with Alexa, but with advocates who know about her case.

""She came to the United States because of discrimination that she had been experiencing in Honduras"" because of her gender identity, Robinson said. Alexa lived in Honduras identifying as a man, but was able to experience a more free life in the U.S., undergoing top surgery a few years ago as she transitioned. She has lived in the U.S. for about 13 years, supporting herself by cleaning businesses and homes while living in an apartment in Ypsilanti.

But as Trump cracked down on immigration and gender-affirming care, her life became upended as she faced discrimination in custody and now faces the possibility of being deported to Honduras, where she could face even more problems.

""She would likely be very likely to be persecuted on account of her gender identity, an identity that is very much innate and has characteristics that she just she cannot change,"" Robinson said. ""And so the likelihood of persecution is going to be even greater.""

Alexa was transferred on July 10 to, and currently stays at, North Lake Correctional Facility, a private prison in northwest Michigan run by GEO Group, which contracts with ICE. Alexa has a different name in government records; the Free Press is using the name she uses.

""All of this was happening inside a U.S. facility, under government custody, where there are supposed to be policies and standards to protect vulnerable individuals, especially those like Alexa,"" read a staff memo from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. ""But Alexa wasn’t protected. She was punished, humiliated, and traumatized simply for being who she is.""

Robinson said this case reveals multiple issues with how immigrants are treated: arresting and detaining immigrants without criminal records; local police working with federal immigration agents on non-criminal cases; holding immigrants for several days in Border Patrol centers not meant for long-term stays; not respecting gender identities of trans people; and denying immigrants bond they were granted under the previous administration.

""This is an ongoing problem,"" Jay Kaplan, staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan's LGBTQ+ Project, told the Free Press. ""A county jail, if they were to deny her medical treatment, that would be highly problematic."" The ACLU filed a lawsuit in March challenging Trump's order against gender-affirming care that includes facilities overseen by the Department of Homeland Security; in June, the ACLU got an injunction from a federal judge blocking Trump's order. In June, a report from the Vera Institute said ICE is excluding data on transgender inmates as required by a congressional mandate.

Border Patrol worked with Romulus police

Here's what happened to Alexa after she was arrested, according to her attorneys and advocates.

After Border Patrol picked her up from the Romulus police station, she was placed in a brightly-lit holding cell, where she was offered only two meals a day and denied hygiene needs such as bathing, her attorney said. It was ""very difficult for her to communicate directly with family members"" or her attorney, but she later was able to, Robinson said.

Romulus Police Chief Robert Pfannes did not return a message seeking comment about Alexa or about what his department's policies are on working with federal immigration agents.

In a statement to the Free Press, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which Border Patrol is part of, strongly denied the claims of mistreatment. The spokesperson said Romulus police contacted Border Patrol for help ""with identifying one subject they had in custody.""

Alexa said she was ""a citizen of Honduras and stated they did not possess any documents allowing them to stay, live, reside, work, or remain in the United States legally,"" the spokesperson said. Border Patrol agents then arrested Alexa and took her to the Gibraltar station ""for identity verification and verification of the documents they had in their possession,"" the U.S. official said. Alexa uses she/her pronouns but was referred to as they/them by the Border Patrol spokesperson.

""The claims they did not shower or have any communication are blatantly false,"" the spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection said. ""Detainees are provided showers, soap, and a clean towel for those approaching 72 hours in detention. They showered on June 9 and June 12. Additionally, agents granted them telephone access per policy. Both of these are outlined in CBP’s National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search.""

Alleged abuse in Ohio county jail

After eight days, Alexa was transferred on June 13 to the Butler County jail, about 30 minutes north of Cincinnati, which works with ICE on holding immigrant inmates, records show.

""From the moment she arrived at Butler, communication was a barrier that endangered her safety,"" said the memo from Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. ""Alexa speaks only Spanish, but staff asked her intake questions in English. It seems that the staff was reluctant to secure an interpreter.""

Alexa said she later realized she may have answered ""yes"" to a question asking her if she was suicidal, but she did not understand at the time what the questions was about. The staff at the jail thought she was suicidal and then stripped Alexa of her clothes and put in a restrictive safety gown that was too small for her, the memo said.

""Her back was exposed,"" the memo said. ""She was denied a blanket. She was forced to either sit on a toilet or press herself against a wall to preserve any sense of dignity.""

In an interview with the Free Press, Butler County Sheriff Chief Anthony Dwyersaid ""there is a record of (Alexa) talking about being suicidal.""

Dwyer said they have translations services given the linguistic diversity of immigrant inmates.

""We have ICE detainees, so we have a multitude of different languages, and we have translation services that we use frequently that have aided us very well, and I think are very well put together,"" Dwyer said. ""We have an actual device that translates, as well as telephonic, where we can make calls and have live translations.""

In Alexa's case, the staff used ""translation services that we're comfortable with,"" Dwyer said. ""And I have documentation when they came in, of what they indicated about the suicidal ideations, and that would trigger (suicide prevention) in our jail."" Dwyer also referred to Alexa with they/them pronouns.

Alexa was then placed in an area not meant for long-term housing, separate from other female inmates. When Alexa asked why she wasn't placed in a regular unit, a staff member told her: ""We don’t know where to put people like you"" because they weren't sure to place her in either a male or female area.

Alexa was placed in a 4' x 8' cell with constant lighting, continued isolation, and not allowed to shower for almost a week. Other inmates were allowed to shower once a day, the memo said.

""She tried to stay clean by washing her underarms at the sink/toilet, having no access to showers,"" the memo said.

Dwyer maintains that Alexa was originally placed in an isolated area known as ""protective custody"" because she had requested it, but then later requested to be taken out of it. She was then ""housed at different locations around our facility,"" Dwyer said.

Deputy sheriff: No mixing of 'biological' men and women

Dwyer said their jail has protocols for trans people, but they will not put biological males with biological females.

""We deal with transgender inmates and we have a lot of protocols in discussing the situation with them and where proper housing is,"" he said. ""Some choose to go into protective custody or isolation. Some choose to be housed here, there or anywhere else. We do not put biological males with biological females. We just do not do that. That is asking for trouble, and it's been trouble around jails in this whole country.""

Another problem was she was not given access to communication with her family and attorney, Robinson said.

""Only after her attorney contacted the sergeant at the jail did staff allow her to bathe,"" the memo said.

Alleged groping after transfer to men's area

Alexa had a bond hearing on July 1, when Jennifer Riedthaler-Williams, a Cleveland immigration judge, said she needed more information before deciding. The following day, July 2, after Alexa had been transferred to a men's area, a male inmate shoved her against the wall and groped her, attempting to assault her, Robinson said.

""A guard witnessed the incident, and instead of intervening right away, just kind of laughed and said, 'Oh, you want to (expletive) him,'"" Robinson said. ""Fortunately, she was able to get another inmate to interpret and another guard listened to her concerns, and she was able to be moved to a safe section, and since then ... as far as I know, she hasn't had any other incidents like that, but it's very disturbing for lots of reasons.""

Dwyer said ""there is no record of any any information where this person made a complaint of an issue as they were touched or assaulted. We have a system in place where they can report that, and I don't have anything, so I can't comment.""

On July 8, Alexa was denied bond, Robinson said. She had strong family ties and an ability to support herself and so she should have gotten bond, which was more the norm in the past, he said.

Another issue was she was unable to get her hormonal treatment that some trans people take. After several weeks without it, she suffered ""breast pain, leakage, and deepening depression,"" the memo said.

""If you're on hormones, stopping those hormones has real effects ... on both short and long term care,"" Robinson said.

ICE did not comment on Alexa's case.

Some groups in Ohio have raised concerns about treatment of ICE inmates in Butler County, but Dwyer said ""it's going fine.""

She said that the process for attorneys and families to access detainees is not yet clearly defined.","A sprawling migrant detention facility in Far East El Paso fades into the desert, appearing somewhat unassuming to passersby. Its distance from the highway diminishes its scale.

“The facility is really, really big and it will continue to grow,” U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said Monday after taking a two-and-half-hour tour of the tent structure on acres of military land north of Montana Avenue off George Dieter Drive.

“It is really massive. It is a huge facility that takes a lot of power – a lot of power – to run. And it takes a lot of people,” said Escobar, the first member of Congress to set foot inside the Department of Homeland Security’s East Montana Detention Facility.

The $1.24 billion, soft-sided Immigration and Customs Enforcement East Montana site on Fort Bliss land began taking in detainees Aug. 1 and now holds about 1,000 people – all men. Its capacity is expected to grow to about 5,000 detainees, including women, in the near future – set to become the largest federal detention center for civil detainees in the country.

Escobar said the facility is a reinforced tent with hard floors and walls that don’t extend to the ceiling but create some division and privacy. Cameras are everywhere, she added.

The funding comes from the Department of Defense budget under the reconciliation bill, known as the Big Beautiful Bill, that provided for $45 billion in supplemental funding to double migrant detention capacity to 100,000 beds.

“When you think about the amount of money that is being funneled into this facility … think about how much good that money would do if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans,” Escobar said during a news conference just outside the facility.

The East Montana Detention Facility is the latest to open in recent months as part of the ramped up immigration enforcement and mass deportations efforts by the Trump administration, which is seeking to deport 1 million people a year.

At least three other detention centers have opened in recent months throughout the country, including what are being called “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot” in Florida and the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.

While the square footage of the East Montana detention center is unclear, a similar tent facility in Northeast El Paso with a capacity of 1,000 people stands at about 153,000 square feet on 28 acres. The El Paso Service Processing Center on Montana Avenue near Hawkins Boulevard can also hold up to 1,000 detainees. Both will likely remain operational, Escobar said.

Nearly 59,400 people were in ICE detention as of Aug. 10 – 70% of them with no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, or TRAC.

In El Paso, TRAC reports an average daily number of detainees at the Montana Facility at just over 800 on Aug. 4, with another 180 at the Northeast facility. TRAC does not yet reflect any statistics from the East Montana facility.

Escobar praised what appeared to be a “highly sophisticated” medical facility at the site, and said the kitchen and open areas are large and clean.

Still, she expressed several concerns, including that the facility which is now running on generators will take a large amount of energy and water resources to maintain the facility. Aside from utility resources, Escobar said she feared the camp was “poaching” health care professionals from the region, offering temporary but high-paying jobs.

Escobar said she wasn’t able to talk with detainees as she has in past visits to other detention facilities, including under Trump’s previous administration. She said that the process for attorneys and families to access detainees is not yet clearly defined.

Escobar, who in early July was denied access to the facility near Hawkins, said her staff has since been able to visit the site and talk to detainees at that site. She said she was on the House floor in Washington, D.C., when her staff was granted access and left with “a lot of case work, which we cannot talk about.” She referred to assistance members of Congress provide to their constituents to help resolve problems related to federal agencies.

East Montana ICE facility to be privately run

While Escobar said that it doesn’t appear that any military personnel are involved in running the East Montana detention center, she said she has other staffing concerns. Most such centers are run by private staffing companies.

“I am very concerned that there are not enough ICE personnel who have been trained by the federal government and have done this for a living for their whole career,” she said. “I’m concerned that there are not as many federal personnel to provide oversight as we should have.”

Without the appropriate number of ICE or other federal employees, she said, it’s too easy for standards to slip “when there are private facilities that far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Acquisition Logistics LLC, a Virginia-based company that specializes in providing logistics and supply chain management services primarily to Department of Defense agencies, was awarded nearly $232 million upfront to begin the work, with an estimated completion date of September 2027 for a total contract of $1.24 billion, according to the DoD.

About 10 other military sites are being considered for ICE detention facilities, with Fort Bliss serving as a model, the New York Times reported in February. The Fort Bliss site was selected after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited with troops at the base earlier this year, according to the news organization. Other sites being considered include Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, and Hill Air Force Base in Utah.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, in a statement said the Trump administration is working “at turbo speed” to execute mass deportations, saying that the Big Beautiful Bill provided “historic funding” to secure 80,000 new ICE beds and capacity to detain up to 100,000 people daily.

“The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” the statement reads.

Sen. John Cornyn, who visited the site but did not go into the facility last week, said during an Aug. 11 news conference that all detention facilities meet state or federal standards, including that detainees receive medical care, three meals a day, air conditioning and “a place to sleep.”

“These are humane, safe facilities and in many instances, a vast improvement over what many of these folks are used to,” Cornyn said, calling the facility “the lone star lockup.” He said the detention facilities are needed to address the “unmitigated disaster” of the past several years and the need to remove “illegal aliens who have no legal right to be here.”

So I, as the [state’s] attorney general, I need to take it seriously.""
Washington’s “Keep Washington Working Act” strictly limits how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities.
Brown said he expects the feds to try and cut federal law enforcement grants again.
“I’ve been waiting for the US Attorney General to give us a hand here,” Swank said.","Washington officials are responding to a letter from the federal government last week demanding they end so-called “sanctuary jurisdiction” policies — local laws stopping police from working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote to Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Aug. 13. “This ends now.”

Ferguson posted on Facebook that “Washington has no intention of changing our values in the face of threats from the Trump administration.”

Washington Attorney General Nick Brown told KUOW the letter is an intimidation tactic that doesn’t rely on “a sound analysis of what the law actually requires.”

""I just think the threats from the Department of Justice and from the Trump administration are fairly hollow when it comes to the actual law,"" Brown said Monday. ""I think the letter is bluster, but it's a letter from the most powerful law enforcement officer in the country. So I, as the [state’s] attorney general, I need to take it seriously.""

Washington’s “Keep Washington Working Act” strictly limits how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities. Adams County’s sheriff and Snohomish County prosecutors have recently landed in court for sharing inmate information and immigration status with federal authorities, and holding people in local jails based solely on immigration status.

The letter contained vague threats to cut federal law enforcement funding to Washington state, which Trump tried to do to other states during his first term — to mixed success. Brown said he expects the feds to try and cut federal law enforcement grants again.

“It’s really absurd, and it's really sad, frankly, that we have an administration that is so vindictive and reckless with public safety, because every law enforcement agency in Washington state relies on assistance from the federal government to some degree or another,” Brown said.

Pierce County Sheriff Keith Swank, a newly-elected conservative with a history of inflammatory posts online, recently went to D.C. to ask the federal government to intervene in Washington. Swank has been involved in litigation with his own county prosecutor over the state’s law.

“I’ve been waiting for the US Attorney General to give us a hand here,” Swank said. “I’m looking forward to warrants being issued. I’m going to have to dust off and oil up my cuffs.”",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/1ec6b0245324fc8348c86bd640a8223f.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-08-19 12:58:45.413592

The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.","The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.

The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.

Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.

One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”

“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”

Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.

Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.

“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Retes’ case comes amid a climate of heightened scrutiny over immigration enforcement in Southern California.","George Retes, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen and Army veteran, spent three days in federal custody after being caught in a large-scale immigration enforcement action at a Southern California cannabis farm. During that time, he said he was denied access to a lawyer, prevented from contacting his family, and placed in an isolation cell, all without being charged with a crime.

Retes, a security guard at Glass House Farms in Camarillo, said he was on his way to work on July 10 when he encountered an ICE roadblock amid protests and federal agents. According to Retes, officers broke his car window, sprayed him with pepper spray and tear gas, and forcibly removed him from the vehicle. Two officers placed a knee on his back while another knelt on his neck, despite his compliance and repeated attempts to identify himself as a U.S. citizen.

He was transported first to a nearby Navy base and then to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, where he remained in custody for three nights. Retes described being covered in chemical irritants, denied showers or fresh clothing, and placed on suicide watch after becoming emotionally distraught. Meanwhile, his family was unable to locate him, and he missed his daughter’s third birthday. He said he received no explanation for his detention and was released without apology or charges.

Now, Retes is seeking accountability through the Federal Tort Claims Act, a law that allows citizens to sue the federal government when harmed by its employees. Represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, Retes has submitted claims to the federal agencies involved. Only if the agencies deny or fail to act on the claims within six months can he proceed to court.

“I’m calling out the federal government not just for what they did to me, but for what they are doing to others,” Retes said. “I’m continuing to fight for this country, now as a civilian.”

Attorneys representing Retes described the case as an example of how federal agents can strip Americans of basic constitutional protections, even when those individuals have served in the military. “George’s claims are a critical step to enforce the Constitution and other laws in court,” said Institute for Justice attorney Marie Miller.

Senior attorney Anya Bidwell added, “Without accountability for these actions, the relationship between citizens and their government remains broken. George is doing his part to repair that relationship, just as he did when he served his country in Iraq.”

The raid at Glass House Farms was part of a broader federal enforcement operation that led to the detention of hundreds of people, including undocumented workers, and sparked protests from farmworkers and advocacy groups. One worker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during the operation. Federal officials have not clarified why Retes, a U.S. citizen, was detained or addressed his allegations of excessive force.

Retes’ case comes amid a climate of heightened scrutiny over immigration enforcement in Southern California. A federal judge recently issued a temporary order barring indiscriminate arrests without warrants in seven counties, including Los Angeles, after concerns that some detainees were targeted based on their appearance rather than any alleged wrongdoing.",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/article-pic-1.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-19 07:56:50.038160

OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’ case.

Evans’ arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

Officials with Old Orchard Beach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE’s detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.",https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d52c44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1440x810+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F21%2Fd3%2F11e784294e2abd9f12d2bbf6b354%2Fap25230635573987.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 07:56:57.194535

When it comes to Illinois laws aimed at protecting immigrants, Adams County Sheriff Tony Grootens has made his views clear.

“I have no intentions of turning away ICE agents or any of them, Homeland Security agents, any of them, that encounter illegal aliens in our community,” Grootens said in a July interview with TV station KHQA. “I know that we’ve had a few, and we put a few in jail and they’ve since been transported out of here by ICE.”

It appears the western Illinois sheriff has made good on his promise, according to documents obtained by WTTW News.

The Adams County Sheriff’s Office has transferred at least two men into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, in apparent violation of the state’s TRUST Act and Way Forward Act, according to a lawyer who helped provide technical support for the legislation. Both men were later deported.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin pointed to both men’s criminal charges — but in one case, the federal government dismissed its criminal complaint; in the other, he was never charged for the alleged crime that landed him in jail.

In addition, the Adams County Jail also has a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service that authorizes ICE to utilize the jail to detain people for $80 a day. Such contracts also appear to run afoul of state law.

The acts generally prohibit collaboration between Illinois law enforcement officers and federal immigration agencies.

“All of those things are violations,” Mark Fleming, associate director of federal litigation with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said of both the men handed off to ICE by Adams County and the jail contract.

WTTW News detailed these apparent violations to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office, which oversees compliance and enforcement of the state’s sanctuary laws. The office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In July, WTTW News sent Grooten’s remarks on KHQA to Raoul’s office for comment. A spokesperson replied that “nothing in the TRUST Act violates federal law. Local law enforcement in Illinois must follow the TRUST Act, just like any other Illinois law. Our office is aware of the comments made by the Adams County Sheriff. We have no further comment at this time.”

WTTW News also laid out the apparent violations to the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The Jail Agreement

The intergovernmental agreement between Adams County and ICE is through a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service and Adams County Jail, effective last February: “this agreement is for the housing, safekeeping, subsistence and care of Federal prisoners.” ICE is marked under “other authorized agency user.”

“No law enforcement agency, law enforcement official, or any unit of State or local government may enter into or renew any contract, intergovernmental service agreement, or any other agreement to house or detain individuals for federal civil immigration violations,” states the Illinois’ Way Forward Act.

“That is precisely one of the scenarios that the Illinois Way Forward Act sought to address,” Fleming said. “That authorization of ICE to use it is a clear violation.”

Fleming compared the situation to a 2021 lawsuit, in which McHenry and Kankakee counties sued to stop the implementation of the Way Forward Act and thereby protect their existing lucrative detention contracts with ICE. But a federal judge upheld the act, terminating the inclusion of ICE on their contracts.

Detainers and ICE Custody

Since the beginning of this year, Adams County has transferred at least two men into ICE custody — which also violates the TRUST Act, according to Fleming. Both men were deported, according to DHS.

In both instances, civil immigration detainers were issued. An immigration detainer is a request that a local law enforcement agency detain an individual to then transfer that person into federal immigration custody.

“A law enforcement agency or law enforcement official shall not detain or continue to detain any individual solely on the basis of any immigration detainer or civil immigration warrant or otherwise comply with an immigration detainer or civil immigration warrant,” the TRUST Act states.

“Unless presented with a federal criminal warrant, or otherwise required by federal law, a law enforcement agency or official may not … transfer any person into an immigration agent’s custody,” it continues.

One case involves Alejandro Palomo-Godines, a Mexican man. In September 2024, he was arrested in Sangamon County and charged with violating federal weapons laws. An immigration detainer was issued for him on June 16.

A June 18 filing shows that the federal government dismissed Palomo-Godines’ case. On June 21, he was transferred from Sangamon County to Adams County Jail in Quincy, held on an ICE detainer and was then “picked up by ICE.”

WTTW News has not been able to reach Palomo-Godines.

The other case involves Romaido Garcia-Santizo, a Mexican man who, according to ICE documents, had been removed on one prior occasion from the United States to Mexico in 2011. He said he worked at a dairy farm in nearby Missouri, the documents state. WTTW News has not been able to reach Garcia-Santizo.

An affidavit from an ICE deportation officer states that in March, he confirmed Garcia-Santizo reentered the U.S. after he was arrested for “aggravated assault use of a deadly weapon” by Quincy police. However, according to the Quincy Police Department, Garcia-Santizo was not charged.

The Quincy Police Department denied a WTTW News request under the Freedom of Information Act for his arrest report.

The ICE affidavit states that after Garcia-Santizo’s arrest, the ICE officer searched through a jail booking database, where he found that Garcia-Santizo was in Adams County Jail custody.

The officer then issued a civil immigration detainer for Garcia, according to the affidavit. Garcia-Santizo was taken into ICE Enforcement and Removal Options custody inside the booking area of the Adams County Jail; this transfer into ICE custody breaks the TRUST Act, Fleming said.

According to the affidavit, Garcia-Santizo was then transported to the St. Louis ICE office before being placed into ICE custody at the Ste. Genevieve County Jail in Missouri. At some point, he was taken back to Adams County Jail during his trial on re-entry charges, according to a court filing. In June, he pleaded guilty to one count of re-entry of a removed alien and was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, filings state.

When asked about Adams County’s apparent violation of the TRUST Act, DHS’ McLaughlin said in a statement that the department condemns “any sanctuary city or jurisdiction for breaking federal immigration law by refusing to enforce our laws.”

In that interview with KHQA, Grootens reasoned his defiance of these sanctuary laws by stating, “If state law conflicts with federal law, federal law trumps state law. Being a sanctuary state, they’re going to seek refuge, protection from the state. But not here.”

But Fleming said it’s not a decision about choosing sides between state and federal law enforcement. What the TRUST Act and Way Forward Act do is withdraw the state and its resources from being expended on immigration enforcement, which is a federal responsibility, he said.

“I am shocked by the county sheriff’s misunderstanding of the law,” Fleming said.

He said the U.S. Supreme Court has made this clear, pointing to the 1997 decision Printz v. United States, where the court ruled that state legislatures are not subject to federal direction.

“Counties are just a subdivision of the state, the state can decide on behalf of the counties and behalf of all municipalities in the state as to what sort of cooperation or participation they may have in enforcing a federal regulatory program, like immigration enforcement, in the state,” Fleming said.

For his part, Gov. JB Pritzker is firm in his belief that state law is not in violation of federal law.

“But let me be clear: We expect the federal government to follow the law, too,” Pritzker said at a June congressional hearing on sanctuary laws. “We will not participate in abuses of power. We will not violate court orders. We will not ignore the Constitution. We will not defy the Supreme Court.”

If local law enforcement breaks these sanctuary statutes, the Attorney General’s Office has “fairly broad power to investigate,” Fleming said.

The attorney general could bring civil action against a sheriff in state court to try to get them into compliance through additional reporting requirements or training. If they remain in blatant violation, Fleming said, it could lead to contempt proceedings against an official.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-19 10:57:07.124204

ALXnow has reached out to the Alexandria Police Department, the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.","Federal immigration agents arrested 15 construction workers at an Alexandria apartment complex Monday afternoon, sparking an evening community rally where city officials and residents denounced the enforcement action.

The arrests occurred at Eaton Square Apartments on Florence Drive in the Chirilagua neighborhood while the men were working on a roofing project, according to Evelin Urrutia, executive director of Tenants and Workers United. The timing coincided with the first day of school in Alexandria, heightening community concerns about children’s safety.

“The people arrested were working on the roof of an apartment building when they were targeted and abducted by masked federal agents,” Urrutia said during the community gathering at 3801 Florence Drive. “This comes as families were ready to pick up their children on the first day of classes.”

Community members filmed the arrests and confirmed that seven to eight ICE agents were present during the operation. Witnesses said the agents provided no information about the reason for the arrests or where they were taking the workers.

On short notice, a couple of dozen people rallied with signs in front of the apartment complex where the workers had been detained earlier in the day.

Mayor Alyia Gaskins attended the rally and condemned the federal enforcement action.

“The men who were taken today, who were kidnapped today, they were not strangers. They are our neighbors. They are someone’s parent. They are someone’s son, someone’s brother, cousin, friend,” Gaskins said. “This is a council that we’re not going to just stay seated. This is a council that the things that are under our authority to do, we will act and do that.”

Vice Mayor Sarah Bagley and City Council member Abdel Elnoubi also attended the community gathering.

City Councilman Canek Aguirre released a statement calling the enforcement action an example of an “authoritarian regime hell bent on terrorizing communities.”

“Masked individuals in tactical gear and unmarked vehicles refusing to identify themselves have chosen the start of a new school year to inflict more fear and terror for many of our neighbors and friends in Alexandria,” Aguirre said.

Oliver Marino, a city resident who works for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and identifies as an undocumented immigrant, described witnessing the workers earlier in the day.

“This morning, I passed through these streets. I saw the men working. They were working. They were just doing things that you and I do every day to feed their families,” Marino said.

The community response included volunteers who monitored the area during the first day of school. Some community members reported seeing ICE agents near an elementary school, though this could not be confirmed.

Reverend Deborah Porras from Beverly Hills Community United Methodist Church called on faith communities to take action.

“This morning, when we were taking children to school, we had people all over this community searching and watching in case we had ICE agents popping up, trying to accost children,” Porras said.

Community leaders also criticized local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, specifically targeting Sheriff Sean Casey’s policies. Marino said his organization has confirmed more than 30 people from the community being transferred to ICE by the sheriff without judicial warrants.

Sammie Moshenberg, a 40-year resident of the neighboring Delray area, referenced Fairfax County Sheriff’s policies as an example of non-cooperation with ICE.

“If the Fairfax County Sheriff understands that there’s no legal reason to cooperate with ICE, why doesn’t our sheriff,” Moshenberg said.

The arrested workers all appeared to be men working for the same construction company, according to witnesses. Community members said they asked the apartment management company for information, but received no response.

Urrutia said the enforcement action represents part of a broader pattern affecting Virginia communities. She advised residents to know their rights, including the right not to open doors to agents and the right to remain silent.

The Chirilagua neighborhood, located in Alexandria’s Arlandria area, has a significant Latino population and a long history of welcoming immigrants. The community gathering drew dozens of residents and supporters.

Tenants and Workers United, which organized the evening rally, works with low-income communities of color, primarily immigrants, to create changes in Northern Virginia.

ALXnow has reached out to the Alexandria Police Department, the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

Amy Bertsch, Public Information Officer for the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office, shared with ALXnow on Monday night, “As Sheriff Casey’s previous statement indicates, the Sheriff’s Office does not participate in any immigration enforcement in our community.” When asked for comment on Monday’s enforcement action, Bertsch said the Sheriff’s Office had “no comment on today’s enforcement” but directed ALXnow to use Casey’s previous statement.

On Aug. 13, the Sheriff’s Office published a statement on immigration concerns stating: “I want to reassure everyone that the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office does not and will not participate in any type of immigration enforcement in our community.”

The statement continues: “The Alexandria Adult Detention Center will never be used to house individuals arrested by ICE during their enforcement of immigration laws. Additionally, we will never use any taxpayer funds or accept any funding for immigration enforcement activities.”

However, the Sheriff’s Office website also notes that Virginia law requires all sheriffs to determine the citizenship of individuals arrested on felony charges and share this information with ICE. The office transfers custody of inmates to ICE on their scheduled release date when ICE has filed a lawful warrant and detainer.

According to data published by the Sheriff’s Office, 35 inmates have been transferred to ICE as of mid-July 2025, compared to 43 in all of 2024.

ICE officials said they detained Santiago “Diego” Martinez, 30, for having a drunken driving conviction. However, his attorney said ICE admitted they made a mistake – Martinez does not have a criminal conviction – but he remained in custody as of Monday.

It was the morning of Aug. 11 that Jennifer Choi got a call from Martinez’s girlfriend, who said he needed help. Choi went behind her restaurant, Sushi Motto, and saw ICE officers detaining Martinez.

“So when I go, Diego was in the car,” Choi said. “And then I said, ‘OK, what's going on?’ They say he don't have a green card. I tell them, he has a green card. He has a green card. I tell them, like two, three times, but they said, ‘We have to take him.’”

Martinez had worked for Choi for more than five years as a sushi chef. She said he was a great employee.

“He has a good heart,” Choi said. “He helped, even though he’s a sushi chef, he helped in the kitchen, dishwash, whatever needed help. He did everything. He never complained.”

Martinez is a Mexican national who was in the country illegally, ICE spokeswoman Christine Cuttita said in an email. ICE officials first encountered Martinez in 2019 when he entered the country and was arrested by airport police, Cuttita said. His case was dismissed by a judge in 2022 for “prosecutorial discretion.”

Margaret Stock, Martinez’s attorney, said Martinez is an Indigenous person from Mexico and was seeking asylum in the United States. The charges for his initial immigration arrest were dismissed, because the judge ruled he had a valid asylum case, Stock said.

“He does have a very good reason not to return,” Stock said. “I mean, people in the family have been killed and murdered.”

It’s not uncommon for asylum cases to take years to resolve, she said.

Cuttita with ICE wrote that Martinez, “jeopardized any legal privilege to remain in the United States when he was arrested by the Anchorage Police Department on Nov. 12, 2024, for driving under the influence.”

But the charges were thrown out, Stock said, and Martinez doesn’t have a drunken driving conviction on his record.

“I talked to the ICE people, and they were operating on misinformation that he had a DWI conviction, which he doesn't have,” Stock said. “But they claim that was the reason, on the telephone to me, that they were arresting him, was that he had a DWI conviction.”

Stock said the ICE officials told her they made a mistake arresting Martinez, since he doesn’t have a drunken driving conviction, but they still won’t release him.

“They told me that once they grab somebody, they're not allowed to release him anymore,” Stock said. “And they say that this is a new rule that has been made up by the DHS leadership, that people who are pending asylum, they can just grab them anytime and put them in detention.”

Cuttita said that convictions and arrests can both jeopardize someone’s immigration status. But Stock said the Department of Homeland Security isn’t following the law.

“I think it's illegal and it's un-American,” Stock said. “It's unconstitutional, and then on top of it, there's obviously errors in the system. So how can we trust the Department of Homeland Security when they make these kinds of egregious errors all the time?”

For now, it remains unclear if Martinez will be deported.

Stock said she was able to meet with Martinez when he was being held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, but the opportunities were limited.

“He was freezing cold and shivering while he was talking to me,” Stock said. “He said it's freezing in there, and then he also told me that they would only let him make one phone call a day. They've denied me access to speak with him because they have special rules that attorneys aren't allowed to go in there for huge chunks of the day. You know, they have hours that are off-limits to attorneys.”

Those rules, Stock said, contradict what ICE’s website says about the Anchorage Correctional Complex, that attorneys can access clients from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

Martinez was transferred to a detention center in Tacoma, and Stock is there, too, working to get him released. But she said she was worried that the center will have similarly harsh conditions and the same lack of access as the Anchorage jail.

Meanwhile, Choi, Martinez’s boss, said she’s concerned about how his detention will impact her business and her employees.

“Everybody is getting sad, like, depressed, I think,” Choi said. “And, you know, some people, they don't even want to work, even though they have a green card. You know, they’re just scared to work.”

Choi said she’s also pitching in to try to get Martinez back to Alaska.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/818a2bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0f%2F21%2Fcad574aa4eddaa48fe2d0b7f864a%2Fimg-7976.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 22:56:26.930002

The reporting uses internal ICE documents obtained by the Post that outline national expansion plans to allow the agency to detain over 107,000 people at once. That’s up from a capacity of some 54,500 at the beginning of the year, and almost 66,000 as of July.

Arizona facilities slated to be newly included are the Maricopa County Jail and the Marana Correctional Facility outside Tucson. Neither facility is currently in use for immigration detention.

Jordan Garcia, Colorado program coordinator with the American Friends Service Committee, says the way local facilities are contracted for federal use varies from state to state. But, local authorities, like cities and counties, have little control over federally-contracted facilities.

“People tend to get really frustrated when they don’t have local control, so the county itself wouldn’t have as much control over the facility if it’s a federally contracted facility,” he said. “People are like ‘oh, I really thought that we would have some sort of say of how things will go in our community,’ and then they get this facility that’s federally-contracted, and then they don’t have that decision-making power.”

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm.","OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine (AP) — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency's effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans' case.

Evans' arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department's E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

The town is aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”

ICE's detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm. WMTW-TV reported Monday that Evans' agreement to a voluntary departure means he will be allowed to leave the U.S. at his own expense to avoid being deported.

Ramirez (IL-03) convened local faith leaders and community defense organizations to discuss the critical role faith communities play in supporting families impacted by the Trump Administration’s attacks and policies. From immigration defense and protection of workers to assisting with food and fighting the criminalization of unhoused neighbors, the leaders shed light on the work their communities have done and how they must stand stronger together to serve the most vulnerable.

During the interfaith convening, Ramirez and local organizations shared information to equip faith leaders to continue supporting neighbors during these challenging times.

“Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. It’s powerful to be in a room with faithful people who hope for a just future. In hard moments, when faith feels difficult, we must remember we are not alone and lean into what we know - that community keeps us safe,” said Congresswoman Ramirez. “Now more than ever, it’s important that people see faith leaders and faith communities stepping into hope, faith, and action: declaring that we will love our neighbors, welcome the stranger, care for the vulnerable.”

The convening counted with the participation of the Public Policy Director at Arise Chicago Adam Kader, Executive Director at CAIR-Chicago Ahmed Rehab, Palenque LSNA’s Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera, and Sanctuary Movement's Pastora Emma Lozano as panelists. The group shared their expertise with nearly 20 faith leaders of various religions and denominations.

“Sanctuary is not a crime, it’s a moral duty. Sanctuary is not only a protection, it’s about resistance. It’s about declaring every human being deserves dignity, safety, and belonging,” said Pastora Emma Lozano, Sanctuary Movement.

“I invite you all to join ARISE Chicago in defending our immigrant neighbors and coworkers, to exercise their rights, to work free from fear, and free from oppression,” added Adam Kader, Public Policy Director at ARISE Chicago, who invited participants to a mobilization action during Labor Day.

“Civil rights are a subset of human rights, and human rights are a subset of empathy for all creatures. What our movement is about is to wake us up from whatever division may exist, whatever fearmongering and terrorizing that happens–usually by really wealthy, privileged people that divide– to stand up together, here in the United States and abroad, for our common humanity and our common existence,” said Executive Director at CAIR-Chicago, Ahmed Rehab.

“As Christians, we follow a God that tells us all the time to welcome a stranger, to love our neighbor, to stand with the most vulnerable, and the Bible for us is clear on that. So I ask you: what does it mean when a stranger is not welcomed but is hunted in our streets? Or when a child sees flashing lights and doesn’t think of safety, but instead thinks of separation? This is an attack on the very image of God in our community,” expressed Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera, Palenque LSNA

""This order and this lawsuit are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza.","Several New York physicians are speaking out against what they say are inhumane conditions at an immigration holding facility in Lower Manhattan.

Monday, physicians from the nonprofit New York Doctors Coalition tried to get into 26 Federal Plaza, requesting access to assess conditions on the 10th floor. That's where the doctors say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an overcrowded and unsanitary holding facility for detained immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security calls it a processing center.

The doctors were turned away by security.

Last month, video released by the New York Immigration Coalition and verified by CBS News New York showed conditions on the 10th floor, although it was unclear when the footage was taken. The person taking the video was heard saying ""Look how they have us here, like dogs.""

""This building has been turned into a place of health abuse""

Last week, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from detaining people in spaces with fewer than 50 square feet per person, and calling for improved access to hygiene, providing sleeping mats and access to medical care.

""The building has been turned into a place of health abuse,"" Dr. Steve Auerbach of New York Doctors Coalition said. ""We've had observers that went to the 10th floor.""

""It is not a residential building. They are violating zoning laws,"" Auerbach added.

""They detained a 7-year-old last week. A 7-year-old. How is that helping anybody?"" Dr. Sonni Mun of New York Doctors Coalition said. ""I think the distress these families are going are similar to people who lose young family members.""

Several advocacy groups who rallied with the doctors Monday called for medical professionals independent of DHS to be allowed in. They told CBS News New York loved ones of those detained fear retaliation for speaking out publicly.

""Complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza,"" DHS says

New York Lawyers for the Public Interest described recent calls they've received.

""Some of the people do not have vital medications that they need to maintain their health. Some of the most alarming things we hear is not having access to HIV medications that they've been on for long term,"" Karina Albistegui Adler of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest said. ""We were contacted about a month ago about a young person who had open heart surgery ... they were detained without their medication that they needed to maintain their health ... unfortunately, by the time they reached us, they opted to leave because they were worried they would die in detention because they were feeling so sick.""

The temporary restraining order remains in place for about another week while the judge considers more longer term relief. DHS says it is appealing the order.

""This order and this lawsuit are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza. The fact of the matter here is the Trump administration is carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history and is removing the worst of the worst from American communities. Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. 26 Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.

A blog post reportedly authored by Eric Lendrum celebrated the January 6 insurrection and compared the following fallout for conservatives to the Holocaust and slavery, Notus reported.

“American conservatives are, right now, on a course for being every bit as ostracized and alienated from broader society as Jews were in the years leading up to Nazi Germany,” he claimed in a 2021 blog post on American Greatness, a rightwing opinion and news site. Lendrum posted on the site until March of this year.

His podcast, The Right Take, is listed in the author’s description on the site. On one episode of the podcast, he said he liked watching videos of scared legislators during the Jan 6 insurrection.

“There’s something so gratifying about seeing the images of these members of Congress — especially the Democrats — crouching under their chairs, putting on those stupid, like, bubble masks, those anti-gas bubble masks, and then taking selfies,” a laughing Lendrum said just days after the Capitol riot.

In another episode, published in October 2022, Lendrum said immigrants put Europe at risk, while also backing the “great replacement theory.” The far-right theory claims that nonwhite immigrants are damaging the influence of white people.

“Given the direction of Europe right now, we could use a far-right government at this point,” said Lendrum.

On X, the account @realEricLendrum has argued for the removal of transgender “ideology” and compared asylum seekers to “scum.”

In another podcast episode, Lendrum referenced his brief period as a press assistant at the Interior Department during the first Trump administration, saying that he would only return to government if he could be closer to the president.

“If I could work more closely with him, that is the one case in which I would ever go back into government work,” said Lendrum, whose online profile was first reported by Notus. “Government work is not fun.”

The Independent has attempted to reach Lendrum for comment.

The DHS Office of Public Affairs states that a speechwriter at the department is responsible for preparing “speeches, talking points, editorials, Congressional testimony, video scripts, web content, and other written content for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.” The department ranks as the largest federal law enforcement agency.

In one of the blog posts linked to Lendrum, he appeared to argue that conservatives were facing political oppression similar to that of slaves and victims of the Holocaust.

“It has been said that the most surefire way to create an authoritarian regime is to completely dehumanize a significant portion of the population, so that their subsequent enslavement by the state will not face any larger resistance. It was true during slavery, it was true during the Holocaust, and it is true now,” the blog post stated.

Responding to questions from The Independent, DHS shared a link to the text of the First Amendment.

The X account linked to Lendrum argued that the U.S. should treat immigrants as an “invading army.”

“They are not migrants. They are not ‘undocumented.’ They are an invading army. The largest invasion in American history,” one post stated in May 2023. “And what are you supposed to do with an invading army? Crush it, by any means necessary. That’s the #AmericaFirst way.”

Also in the blog post about January 6, the author said, “The Democrats were absolutely terrified — literally cowering under their seats, horrified at the prospect of mere peasants walking through the halls of their castle.”

The lawmakers, including Republicans, were escorted by Capitol Police through the Capitol complex.

“The truth is that they are grateful the events of that day unfolded as they did,” the post argued regarding the Democrats.

In a podcast episode published in April 2023, he said he would “always properly deadname t***** freaks.”

“I will keep calling them t******* because I know it’s derogatory, and I know they freakin’ hate it. That’s why I deadname them. That’s why I use their original pronouns,” he said. “You control the language. Don’t give these freaks an inch on the language.”

“We need to eradicate transgenderism. Wipe it off the face of the Earth. Destroy it. Get rid of it,” he added. “As a disclaimer, I’m not saying to wipe the people out. I’m not saying get rid of the people. I’m saying eliminate the ideology. Cure these people.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/18/18/42/eric-lendrum.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-08-18 22:56:45.058916

Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth added that VOCA funding is directly responsible for keeping things like domestic violence shelters open, and they're now under threat.
Nationwide, VOCA funds go to help nearly 9 million crime victims each year, providing compensation for some 200,000 victims claims.
""VOCA funding is hugely important to the statewide domestic and sexual violence services system,"" said Oregon State Representative Tawna Sanchez.
Sanctuaries under fire The battle over federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions goes far beyond VOCA funds.","SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is joining a group of 21 AGs in suing to unlock federal funding for programs meant to help victims of crime, funding which the Trump administration has withheld from ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions across the country.

The funding in question is authorized by Congress under the Victims of Crime Act and distributed through grants to organizations which support victims and survivors of crime. VOCA has been law since 1984, but the Trump administration is now conditioning that funding on states agreeing to assist with federal immigration enforcement.

""This is yet another attempt to place unlawful conditions on federal funds coming into Oregon to advance the President's unpopular agenda, this time at the expense of crime victims and survivors,"" Rayfield said. ""These grants support services like the counselor who picks up the phone at 2 a.m., the shelter bed that keeps a mom and her kids safe tonight, or the advocate who walks a victim through the court process.""

STRIAGHT TALK: Oregon AG Dan Rayfield addresses legal challenges on Trump's executive orders

Last week, a sexual assault resource center in Beaverton had to abruptly pause all services due to the cutoff of federal funds, Rayfield said during a press conference on Monday. There is no timeline for reopening.

Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth added that VOCA funding is directly responsible for keeping things like domestic violence shelters open, and they're now under threat. His office will need to cut more than half of its victim advocates as well, he said.

""Let me be clear about what (this) means: When you cut victim services, you're choosing to have more crime,"" Wentworth said. ""A victim without support is a victim who cannot testify. A survivor without a place to go is a survivor who is forced to return to her abuser.""

Melissa Erlbaum of Clackamas Women's Services said that a prior 40% cut to VOCA funds had already forced them to lay off staff and reduce services. But even those reduced funds are now out of reach, she said, forcing programs to pause or shut down entirely.

""We are at the perfect storm of funding catastrophe,"" said Jenny Gilmore-Robinson with children's aid organization CARES Northwest. ""Loss of federal funding, increased competition for private grants, financial uncertainty among donors; and, as a health care clinic with 75% of our pediatric patients on Oregon Health Plan, we're also potentially facing cuts to Medicaid.""

According to Rayfield's office, 146 organizations in Oregon rely on VOCA grants, and they stand to lose $15 million in 2025 alone. VOCA isn't funded by taxpayer dollars, but by criminal fines.

Nationwide, VOCA funds go to help nearly 9 million crime victims each year, providing compensation for some 200,000 victims claims.

""VOCA funding is hugely important to the statewide domestic and sexual violence services system,"" said Oregon State Representative Tawna Sanchez. ""The reduction in these funds is likely to have a devastating effect on the programs that serve some of the most vulnerable populations in our state.""

In 1987, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a sanctuary law. What it means in practice is that state and local officials and law enforcement are barred from assisting with federal immigration enforcement. The law prohibits the use of any state or local resources to ""detect and apprehend"" people whose only crime was being in violation of immigration laws.

The states suing to release VOCA funding argue that Congress would need to approve the placement of any additional restrictions on those funds, and that the Trump administration is violating the separation of powers by imposing its own political conditions on the funds.

In this lawsuit, Oregon joins the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Sanctuaries under fire

The battle over federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions goes far beyond VOCA funds. In a letter sent to Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired a warning shot over Oregon's sanctuary status.

Bondi threatened investigations, civil or criminal legal actions, and the leveraging of federal contracts or funds if Oregon doesn't aid federal immigration enforcement efforts — which is, again, prohibited under Oregon law.

""You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,"" Bondi's letter reads. ""This ends now.""

As of Monday morning, Kotek's office told KGW that they were reviewing the AG's letter, but they argued that Oregon's sanctuary law does not obstruct federal immigration efforts.

""I will fight for the safety and prosperity of every Oregonian, from recent immigrants to people who have been here for generations,"" Kotek said in a statement. ""Threats like this undermine our values and our right to govern ourselves. We will not be bullied into doing the federal government's job of immigration enforcement.""

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson received a letter from Bondi as well over the Evergreen State's sanctuary status. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said that the DOJ has no legal standing, calling the letter a threat.

""I don't take those threats lightly,"" Brown said. ""I mean, to have the AG of the United States making threats against local officials is absurd, and should be noteworthy for everyone that's paying attention.""

Ferguson posted on social media that he would respond to Bondi on Tuesday, but said that Washington has no intention of turning its back on its values.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/e2472f22-06b5-46e4-b570-00a00ed55feb/20250424T233950/e2472f22-06b5-46e4-b570-00a00ed55feb_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 20:56:29.009225

According to HRW, while the protests had largely been peaceful, the law enforcement officers frequently used a range of “less lethal” weapons, such as tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades, at protestors without apparent justification and clear, audible dispersal orders or warnings. HRW stated these less deadly weapons can still potentially cause serious injury and death.

Ida Sawyer–the crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch–stated, “Local, state, and federal law enforcement’s aggressive response to these protests violently oppressed the public’s right to express outrage and the media’s right to report safely.”

HRW specifically documented 39 cases of journalists injured by law enforcement, including Lauren Tomasi, an Australian journalist from 9News, who was fired at by a police officer using a kinetic impact projectile, resulting in a bruise on her leg. The events prompted the injured journalists and protesters to file lawsuits against the County of Los Angeles and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

HRW further stated that the use of force by the law enforcement violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Personnel, as well as the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

In particular, Article 21 of ICCPR permits restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly only in limited circumstances that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect public order, public safety, and the rights of others. Moreover, the UN Basic Principles stipulate that law enforcement officials should first use non-violent means to disperse protests, and avoid using force at all to disperse non-violent protests, regardless of whether the authorities consider the protests illegal.

Section 13652 of California’s Penal Code additionally forbids law enforcement from using “kinetic energy projectiles” to disperse a protest, except “to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury” or to “bring any objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely under control.”
