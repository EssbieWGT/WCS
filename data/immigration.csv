A monthslong effort by the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops under federal control in U.S. cities keeps evolving amid a barrage of legal challenges.

The deployments have ramped up and down in cities including Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis. The administration often cited crime and protests as reasons for the deployments over the legal objections of local leaders.

Trial courts around the country have ruled the deployments are illegal and unwarranted, but the administration has challenged these rulings in appeals courts, often resulting in orders blocking the deployments being put on hold.

A federal judge in California, for example, ordered an end to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles on Dec. 10. The decision came just days after an appeals court paused a lower court order that would have ended the deployment in Washington, DC on Dec. 11.

All eyes are currently on the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to weigh in on whether Trump can deploy the National Guard in Chicagowhile the case progresses. It's a decision that likely won’t put an end to the litigation, but could have implications for other cities, according to Joseph Nunn, a legal expert on National Guard deployments with the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program.

""While the Supreme Court has just been sitting on this and presumably writing opinions, everyone else is kind of holding their breath,"" said Nunn.

Meanwhile, the status of the Guard deployments has been constantly in flux with many now remaining under federal control but unable to be deployed as the legal battles play out.

Here’s a look at where things stand across the nation

Los Angeles

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Los Angeles became one of the first locations for Trump's National Guard deployments in June. The administration sent about 4,000 California guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to protect federal personnel and property amid demonstrations against a wave of immigration raids that sometimes turned violent.

Are troops still on the ground? As immigration protests dwindled, the Pentagon withdrew a majority of the troops. But the administration issued new orders federalizing the remaining 300 California National Guard troops first through November and then through February. As of Dec. 11, 100 federalized California National Guard members remain at various locations in LA, according to court documents.

What have courts said? Gov. Gavin Newsom swiftly sued the administration, arguing Trump had overstepped his authority. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that Trump had deployed the Guard unlawfully, but a federal appeals court let Trump retain control of the state's National Guard while the governor's lawsuit proceeded. California challenged the new orders federalizing troops through February, and Breyer sided with the state again on Dec. 10.

Chicago

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Trump deployed 300 Illinois National Guard troops to the city in October to support immigration enforcement officers facing fierce pushback from protestors.

Are troops still on the ground? Three hundred Illinois National Guard members remain federalized but are “not engaging in Federal Protection Mission operational activities,” according to NORAD and U.S. Northern Command. Troops from Texas reportedly began withdrawing from Chicago in November, Reuters reported.

What have courts said? State and local leaders immediately sued the Trump administration after troops were deployed. A federal judge in Chicago temporarily blocked the deployment, saying it “is likely to lead to civil unrest.” A federal appeals court largely upheld that decision, but said Trump could still federalize the National Guard, and troops already deployed don’t need to return home yet. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to remove a lower court's block on his deployment of troops in Chicago. The high court asked both sides to explain their interpretation of language in the statute that gives the president the authority to federalize the Guard, and a decision could come any day, Nunn said.

Will this case impact other cities? ""Whatever we get from the Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to be some kind of final merit ruling,"" Nunn said. ""But it is still going to have a very profound impact, I'm sure, on both the Illinois case, but also the Portland and Los Angeles cases just because the lower courts are going to look to see what the Supreme Court does and take guidance from that.""

Portland

When were National Guard Troops deployed and why? Trump announced in September he was sending the Guard to Portland, a liberal stronghold he described as “war ravaged” and “burning to the ground.”

Are troops still on the ground? Gov. Tina Kotek said on Nov. 19 that 100 of the 200 Oregon National Guard members who were put under federal control on Sept. 28 would remain federalized. The announcement, prompted by a temporary order from the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, was a major reversal that came an hour after the governor said all the troops would be returning home. Newsom's office said the Defense Department told the state that its National Guard members would start returning from Oregon, Reuters reported in November.

What have courts said? The deployment was immediately challenged in court by city and state officials. In early October, U.S. District Court judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued temporary restraining orders blocking the federalization and deployment of the National Guard troops from Oregon and any other state. After a three-day trial in early November, Immergut ruled troops could not be deployed in Portland. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where it previously received a favorable ruling in the Los Angeles case.

Washington, DC

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Trump sent thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops into the nation's capital after declaring a “crime emergency” on Aug. 11.

Are troops still on the ground? The administration announced it would deploy 500 more troops in response to a deadly ""ambush"" on two guardsmen. Approximately 2,781 National Guard members are on the ground in Washington, according to the Joint Task Force – District of Columbia.

What have courts said? The city government sued the Trump administration in September, arguing the deployment is unconstitutional and violates federal law. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with the city, temporarily blocking the administration from deploying troops to enforce the law without approval from Mayor Muriel Bowser. But an appeals court lifted Cobb's injunction, which would have forced troops to leave by Dec. 11. The order is temporary and does not address the merits of the case.

Will this case impact other cities? Trump's authority to use the guard in Washington is unique because it is the seat of the federal government. That means ""basically everything"" about the case is different than the litigation in other cities and the impact of the outcome will be limited to DC, Nunn said.

Memphis

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, welcomed the president's September announcement that he would deploy troops to Memphis despite objections from Mayor Paul Young.

Are troops still on the ground? The number of National Guard troops in Memphis has increased to about 245, a spokesperson with the Memphis Police Department confirmed on Dec. 4.

What have courts said? Several elected officials have sued Lee over the deployment. On Nov. 17, a Tennessee judge temporarily blocked the deployment, aligning with state and local lawmakers who said use of the troops for law enforcement violates the state constitution. Judge Patricia Head Moskal said the city’s crime rates were not a ""grave emergency"" or ""disaster"" justifying military intervention by the governor. The state of Tennessee on Dec. 2 appealed that decision, and Moskal's injunction blocking the deployment is not in effect while the appeal is pending.

Will this case affect other cities? Memphis is ""a whole other barrel of fish"" that differs from the Washington, Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago cases because it's a state court case, not a federal one, according to Nunn. ""It's not going to have any impact outside of Tennessee, even if you saw the same sort of gambit in a different state,"" Nunn said.

The Oregon Health Authority officials and Gov.","In a case affecting Oregon, a California judge has extended a ban on the Trump administration sharing the private information of health care enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement.

On Tuesday, Judge Vince Chhabria in the Northern District of California ordered that his preliminary injunction from August be extended until Jan. 5. The ruling is intended to block a controversial push by the administration from using information provided to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income residents, for arresting and deporting people.

News of the federal push to give the data to Homeland Security over the legal and ethical objections of federal Medicaid officials broke in June amid the continued federal immigration campaign that has often targeted people based only on the color of their skin. The arrests and deportations have sparked fear, constitutional and civil rights concerns and a global backlash affecting health care providers, as well as widespread protests and litigation.

Chhabria’s order is the latest development in a lawsuit brought in July by California, Oregon and the 20 other states to permanently stop the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from sharing personal information with the Department of Homeland Security. In August, when announcing the first temporary ban on that data sharing and use, Chhabria noted that federal administrations have had a longstanding policy of only using Medicaid information for health care services and not for immigration enforcement. He said before changing that policy, the administration needed to conduct a thorough review.

He said the temporary ban on the data sharing and use of the information by immigration agents would stay in place while the lawsuit continued or until 14 days after the administration conducted a thorough review.

Chhabria’s latest decision prevents immigration authorities from using information they’ve already obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for immigration enforcement and the transfer of new data.

The decision marks a temporary victory for the 22 states involved in the lawsuit: California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

In Oregon, Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s office welcomed the judge’s latest order to extend the ban until January, saying that would give the parties time to submit more arguments.

“We filed this lawsuit because the federal government’s plan to share Medicaid data with immigration authorities is unlawful. We’re asking the court to block this data-sharing policy before it can do more harm,” a statement said. “Oregonians deserve to know their health care information isn’t being used as an immigration enforcement tool.”

But it’s unclear what will happen over the long term. At the end of November, the Trump administration published a notice in the Federal Registry, saying it intends to resume that data sharing with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“(ICE) contemplates requesting from CMS available biographical, contact and location information, though ICE reserved the right, in a specific case, to consider requesting other information on a case-by-case basis,” the notice said.

It indicated its review was over.

“CMS is publishing this notice solely to inform interested parties of its decision to provide information to ICE consistent with federal law,” the notice said.

The notice apparently did not satisfy the judge that CMS has followed his earlier order that a thorough process had taken place.

Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday.

Data already shared

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services already has shared data from California, Washington, Illinois and Washington, D.C., with immigration authorities. CMS has also issued demands to Oregon for information about residents without legal residency who are receiving Medicaid benefits.

Traditional Medicaid, which provides free physical, mental and dental benefits, is largely funded by federal dollars and excludes most immigrants, but 12 states — Oregon, California, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Maine — and Washington D.C. spend state dollars to provide free health care benefits to low-income children without residency documentation, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Six states among them, Oregon, California, Washington, Colorado, Illinois and New York, as well as Washington D.C. also extend the same benefits to adults.

In Oregon, 1.4 million people receive Medicaid benefits, including more than 105,000 who qualify through Healthier Oregon, the state-funded program for people regardless of their immigration status.

At the end of July, Oregon declined to share extensive data about these Medicaid enrollees with CMS. The Trump administration responded in August with a new campaign, demanding that Oregon and other states verify the immigration status of those enrolled in Medicaid.

The Oregon Health Authority officials and Gov. Tina Kotek have said they would not turn over any personal information that would violate privacy laws.

The agency and the governor’s office did not respond by Wednesday afternoon to a request for comment about the extended court order and pressure from the Trump administration.

Immigration officials have stepped up enforcement in Oregon, and those campaigns have had a negative effect on immigrants, including those with legal residency. Though clinics that largely serve immigrants and people on the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s Medicaid program, have told The Lund Report that they continue to see the same demand for health services from immigrants, the administration’s campaign has provoked widespread anxiety and fear.

And that has taken a toll on providers and patients, with people starting to cloister at home for fear of running into ICE agents.",https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-12/PatientInformationIllustration_Shutterstock.jpg?itok=Uc55dqbE,N,,2025-12-11 21:57:22.229415

Border crossings sit at a record low nearly a year into his second administration and a new wave of immigration enforcement is dividing families inside the U.S.

Federal officials and their local law enforcement partners are detaining tens of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants. Detainees are moved repeatedly, then deported, or held in poor conditions for weeks or months before asking to go home.

The federal government was holding an average of more than 66,000 people in November, the highest on record.

During the first Trump administration, families were forcibly separated at the border and authorities struggled to find children in a vast shelter system because government computer systems weren't linked. Now parents inside the United States are being arrested by immigration authorities and separated from their families during prolonged detention. Or, they choose to have their children remain in the U.S. after an adult is deported, many after years or decades here.

The Trump administration and its anti-immigration backers see “unprecedented success"" and Trump’s top border adviser Tom Homan told reporters in April that “we’re going to keep doing it, full speed ahead.”

Three families separated by migration enforcement in recent months told The Associated Press that their dreams of better, freer lives had clashed with Washington’s new immigration policy and their existence is anguished without knowing if they will see their loved ones again.

For them, migration marked the possible start of permanent separation between parents and children, the source of deep pain and uncertainty.

Antonio Laverde left Venezuela for the U.S. in 2022 and crossed the border illegally, then requested asylum.

He got a work permit and a driver’s license and worked as an Uber driver in Miami, sharing homes with other immigrants so he could send money to relatives in Venezuela and Florida.

Laverde's wife Jakelin Pasedo and their sons followed him from Venezuela to Miami in December 2024. Pasedo focused on caring for her sons while her husband earned enough to support the family. Pasedo and the kids got refugee status but Laverde, 39, never obtained it and as he left for work one early June morning, he was arrested by federal agents.

Pasedo says it was a case of mistaken identity by agents hunting for a suspect in their shared housing. In the end, she and her children, then 3 and 5, remember the agents cuffing Laverde at gunpoint.

“They got sick with fever, crying for their father, asking for him,” Pasedo said.

Laverde was held at Broward Transitional Center, a detention facility in Pompano Beach, Florida. In September, after three months detention, he asked to return to Venezuela.

Pasedo, 39, however, has no plans to go back. She fears she could be arrested or kidnapped for criticizing the socialist government and belonging to the political opposition.

She works cleaning offices and, despite all the obstacles, hopes to reunify with her husband someday in the U.S.

Yaoska’s husband was a political activist in Nicaragua, a country tight in the grasp of autocratic married co-presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo.

She remembers her husband getting death threats and being beaten by police when he refused to participate in a pro-government march. Yaoska spoke on condition of anonymity and requested the same for her husband to protect him from the Nicaraguan government.

The couple fled Nicaragua for the U.S. with their 10-year-old son in 2022, crossing the border and getting immigration parole. Settling down in Miami, they applied for asylum and had a second son, who has U.S. citizenship. Yaoska is now five months pregnant with their third child.

In late August, Yaoska, 32, went to an appointment at the South Florida office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Her family accompanied her. Her husband, 35, was detained and failed his credible fear interview, according to a court document.

Yaoska was released under 24-hour supervision by a GPS watch that she cannot remove. Her husband was deported to Nicaragua after three months at the Krome Detention Center, the United States’ oldest immigration detention facility and one with a long history of abuse.

Yaoska now shares family news with her husband by phone. The children are struggling without their father, she said.

“It’s so hard to see my children like this. They arrested him right in front of them,” Yaoska said, her voice trembling.

They don’t want to eat and are often sick. The youngest wakes up at night asking for him.

“I’m afraid in Nicaragua,” she said. “But I’m scared here too.”

Yaoska said her work authorization is valid until 2028 but the future is frightening and uncertain.

“I’ve applied to several job agencies, but nobody calls me back,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to me.""

Edgar left Guatemala more than two decades ago. Working construction, he started a family in South Florida with Amavilia, a fellow undocumented Guatemalan migrant.

The arrival of their son brought them joy.

“He was so happy with the baby — he loved him,” said Amavilia, 31. “He told me he was going to see him grow up and walk.”

But within a few days, Edgar was detained on a 2016 warrant for driving without a license in Homestead, the small agricultural city where he lived in South Florida.

She and her husband declined to provide their last names because they are worried about repercussion from U.S. immigration officials.

Amavilia expected his release within 48 hours. Instead, Edgar, who declined to be interviewed, was turned over to immigration officials and moved to Krome.

“I fell into despair. I didn’t know what to do,” Amavilia said. “I can’t go.”

Edgar, 45, was deported to Guatemala on June 8.

After Edgar’s detention, Amavilia couldn’t pay the $950 rent for the two-bedroom apartment she shares with another immigrant. For the first three months, she received donations from immigration advocates.

Today, breastfeeding and caring for two children, she wakes up at 3 a.m. to cook lunches she sells for $10 each.

She walks with her son in a stroller to take her daughter to school, then spends afternoons selling homemade ice cream and chocolate-covered bananas door to door with her two children.

Amavilia crossed the border in September 2023 and did not seek asylum or any type of legal status. She said her daughter grows anxious around police. She urges her to stay calm, smile and walk with confidence.

“I’m afraid to go out, but I always go out entrusting myself to God,” she said. “Every time I return home, I feel happy and grateful.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d9aecfca-b767-4567-ba73-e5422cbf64a5/wirestory_76e1c6239c1522aae010590195f97db3_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-11 22:56:19.483728

The event, moderated by Harvard Law School lecturer Aminta Ossom, featured the Center’s four Senior Human Rights and Foreign Policy Fellows, all of whom previously held top human rights roles in the U.S. government under the Biden administration.

Ossom opened by asking how Americans have shaped international human rights norms and how those norms have, in turn, shaped the United States. Kelly Fay Rodríguez, who served as the U.S. Special Representative for International Labor Affairs, said “there’s a real, blatant tension historically and today when you think about the U.S. and the global human rights system.” The United States helped build human rights institutions, she noted, yet “the U.S. government, corporations, and actors have also played a role either as perpetrator or enabler of some of the worst human rights atrocities.” The normalization of certain practices, including abuses in the immigration system, she said, contributes to “the kind of moments we’re experiencing now.”

There’s a real, blatant tension historically and today when you think about the U.S. and the global human rights system. –Kelly Fay Rodríguez

Maggie Dougherty, formerly a senior director for international organizations at the National Security Council, emphasized the extent of U.S. involvement in the United Nations system. Americans, she said, continue to hold influential positions in Geneva because of a long history of academic and diplomatic engagement, even in periods like the present when the U.S. government reduces participation. She also noted that the United States has historically been the largest financial contributor to U.N. human rights bodies.

Jessica Stern, who served as the U.S. Special Envoy for LGBTQI+ rights, described how that influence shapes global norms. She said the country’s political and financial contributions have given it significant weight at the United Nations and warned that with the rise of authoritarianism and decline of multilateralism, “the U.N. is in crisis, and international human rights norms are more needed than ever.”

We were still in the thick of Jim Crow, yet we had the U.S. leading the creation of a document saying every human being has universal rights and dignity,” –Desirée Cormier Smith

Desirée Cormier Smith, the former U.S. Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice, drew attention to historical contradictions reaching all the way back to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). “We were still in the thick of Jim Crow, yet we had the U.S. leading the creation of a document saying every human being has universal rights and dignity,” she said. She recalled that the NAACP submitted a petition to the United Nations in 1947 detailing racial terror in the United States and that, according to many historical accounts, government officials resisted the petition because it would “embarrass the United States” as it promoted the adoption of the UDHR and sought to position itself as a counterpoint to Soviet opression.

When Ossom asked how international standards affect people’s daily lives, Dougherty offered the example of the U.N. Human Rights Council investigation into abuses in North Korea. The inquiry relied on interviews with refugees outside the country and produced documentation that informed international legislation and sanctions. For Dougherty, it demonstrated how global mechanisms can illuminate conditions in places where direct access is blocked.

Cormier Smith pointed to the limits of such mechanisms when governments place reservations on human rights treaties. The United States has often included provisions stating that treaties are “non-self-executing” or otherwise non-binding, which she argued has weakened their actual impact. Fay Rodríguez added that multilateral bodies often serve as the only safe platform for workers and activists facing repression, citing Burmese workers who use the International Labour Organization to raise concerns about forced labor.

“The U.N. is in crisis, and international human rights norms are more needed than ever.” –Jessica Stern

In response to Ossom’s question about progress, panelists listed recent developments connected to international norms. Fay Rodríguez pointed to labor union activism promoting global human rights for marginalized groups outside their own countries. Cormier Smith highlighted Peru’s constitutional recognition of Afro-Peruvians, adopted in 2024, and noted that international mechanisms helped bring visibility to longstanding advocacy efforts. Stern cited India’s decision to strike down colonial-era sodomy laws, a ruling that referenced U.N. interpretations of privacy and equality, and pointed to the Human Rights Council’s first resolution on the rights of intersex people, which condemned unnecessary surgeries.

The conversation also offered critiques of the international system. Cormier Smith described civil society frustrations, including limited speaking time, inadequate translation services, and the high cost of attending U.N. sessions in Geneva during the first meeting of the U.N. Permanent Forum on People of African Descent. Dougherty criticized the Human Rights Council’s election structure, noting that “China sits on the Human Rights Council. It’s insane, but that’s how it is,” referring to the closed regional slates that allow governments with abusive records to win uncontested seats and thereby weaken the Council’s credibility. Fay Rodríguez and Stern said some governments challenge established human rights norms, and multilateralism itself, to avoid accountability, including on issues such as the right to strike or abuses against minority groups.

“China sits on the Human Rights Council. It’s insane, but that’s how it is.” –Maggie Dougherty

Audience questions turned to the future of human rights under another Trump administration. Stern described steep staffing reductions within the State Department’s human rights bureau and warned of a shift toward a “natural rights” framework that, she said, redefines key protections as political preferences rather than legal obligations. She argued that advocates must focus on defending existing standards.

Cormier Smith urged civil society and academia to remain active internationally so that partners abroad do not feel abandoned, while Fay Rodríguez and Dougherty emphasized documentation and local organizing as essential tools, regardless of political conditions.

In closing the event, Ossom drew together several themes raised by the panelists. She noted that past movements show how progress often meets backlash and that earlier generations used moments of repression to build civic institutions that strengthened rights over the long term.

Multiple U.S. citizens across the Twin Cities report being detained by ICE, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to call on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to review the incidents in a letter on Wednesday.

His letter came just hours after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O’Hara publicly raised concerns about the detentions.

The latest case involves Mubashir, who didn’t want his last name shared. He’s a U.S. citizen who said he has no criminal record and was detained by ICE on Tuesday.

Cell phone video shows ICE agents confronting him in the back stairwell of a Minneapolis restaurant.

“I didn’t know who it was. I just saw that person, that mask, just come out the car, sprint at me full speed,” Mubashir said.

In the video, agents can be heard asking Mubashir why he was running. He responds that he wasn’t running and repeatedly tells them he is a U.S. citizen and can show his passport.

“I told him, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen.’ He [ICE agent] didn’t seem to care,” he said.

Another video shows Mubashir handcuffed near an unmarked vehicle. He said he was taken to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, held for a few hours, and then released.

“All I did was step outside as a Somali American, and I just got chased by a masked person,” he said. “I don’t want to come outside anymore because all I did was go and try to get some food. I can’t even get food without being tackled and put in a chokehold.”

At a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the incident.

“They deserve the same rights as every other American because they are American citizens. They’ve got the full support of this city government behind them,” Frey said.

When asked what Mayor Frey would say to people who argue ICE is “just doing their job,” the mayor responded, “I’m not sure that some of them know what job they’re doing,” he said. “This is the kind of deal where you’re randomly stopping somebody on the street because they look Somali or Latino.”

Immigration attorney Gloria Contreras Edin, based in St. Paul, said these incidents are legally complicated.

She pointed to a September Supreme Court ruling allowing ICE agents to consider race, ethnicity and accents during immigration stops.

“So unfortunately, when someone’s skin color alludes that this person may be from another country, then an ICE officer can confront the individual,” she said. “It is legal, according to the Supreme Court.”

Edin said citizens can still be temporarily detained during encounters even if they immediately state their citizenship.

“Immigration Law allows immigration agents to arrest anyone whom they believe are in violation of immigration laws,” she said. “Even though they say they’re a U.S. citizen, they may be temporarily detained until they can prove it.”

She mentioned U.S. citizens can also be detained under other circumstances.

“If a U.S. citizen is confronting an officer, if a U.S. citizen is obstructing the officer from doing their job, if a U.S. citizen is assaulting an officer, then that U.S. citizen may be detained,” she said.

Still, Edin said the recent incidents raise concerns.

“I am just appalled, and I am saddened and heartbroken that folks who are U.S. citizens have to be worried and scared about being arrested. I’m advising people to carry a copy of their passport with them,” she said.

Edin mentioned she’s witnessed some ICE arrests in a ‘calm controlled and safe setting.”

Addressing recent detentions of U.S. citizens, the attorney noted that ICE can face consequences if they make an unlawful arrest.

One of the group’s volunteers arrived at Sip Café three minutes after receiving a call about suspected ICE activity there, but the reported agents were already gone.
Music City MigraWatch received at least 20 calls, she said, on top of numerous text messages and social media messages.","In Inglewood Wednesday morning, a white work van with ladders strapped to its roof sat empty in a parking lot near Sip Café. Employees inside told the Banner the van’s driver had been stopped by armed men in unmarked vehicles, who handcuffed him and took him away. The armed men, the employees said, were not wearing uniforms or badges indicating that they were with a government agency. On social media, word spread that the unidentified men were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“We are horrified that something this vile happened outside Sip,” read a post on the shop’s Instagram account. “We urge all of our friends to be careful — this ambush happened out in the street just a little while ago.”

It was one of multiple incidents that fueled alarm and uncertainty among immigrant communities and advocate networks throughout the day as reported ICE sightings came from East and South Nashville. Rapid response operations like Music City MigraWatch posted photos on social media of what they believed to be ICE vehicles and the empty work vans left behind by the people they’d taken. One post showed a white van pulled over by unmarked vehicles with red and blue flashing lights on Bell Road.

But getting clear information about what had happened or was happening — who was taken and by whom — was complicated, given the agency’s tactics. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Highway Patrol — which collaborated with federal agents during a large operation in Nashville in May — told the Banner they were “not aware of any such activity.” A spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department also said its officers weren’t involved in the incidents reported on social media Wednesday. ICE officials could not be reached for comment.

The Spanish-language news outlet Nashville Noticias reported Wednesday evening that at least eight people had been taken into custody by ICE agents in various locations, citing relatives of the people who’d been detained.

Ashley Warbington, an advocate with Music City MigraWatch, told the Banner the group first received a tip around 6:30 a.m. from a person who believed they’d seen ICE agents in Nippers Corner in South Nashville. A volunteer named Carleen, who asked that her last name be withheld, said she and her husband drove to the area to verify the report and saw unmarked vehicles with flashing blue and red lights surrounding a red work van in the center lane of a five-lane road. By the time they turned around, the van had been moved to a nearby parking lot and was unoccupied. She did not see anyone being detained. She said the group had flagged one of the vehicles as having “been associated with ICE in the past” and was further convinced of the affiliation by the red and blue lights.

Warbington said that volunteers and community members have been following Music City MigraWatch’s reports of ICE activity on social media accounts and alerting the group when they believe they see the same vehicles in other areas.

One of the group’s volunteers arrived at Sip Café three minutes after receiving a call about suspected ICE activity there, but the reported agents were already gone. It’s not clear how many people were detained at that location.

Warbington said Wednesday was an unusually active day for ICE watchers in Nashville.

“We’ve had days similar in the past couple of weeks, but it has been in Lebanon, for example, or in Franklin,” she said. “This was mostly in Davidson County.”

The apparent incident at Sip Café, she said, had set off a flurry of rumors and reports of ICE activity elsewhere in the East Nashville area, most of which could not be verified. Music City MigraWatch received at least 20 calls, she said, on top of numerous text messages and social media messages.

“My fingers are tired from texting, I’ll just say that,” she said.

Zach Young, who represents the Inglewood area on the Metro Nashville Public Schools board, said he heard from another public official that a suspected ICE vehicle had been spotted near an elementary school in the neighborhood. He said he informed the principal, who was “already standing in his office looking out the window.”

Young said school officials are “very well versed” in policies for responding to a law enforcement inquiry, including seeking counsel from Metro lawyers.

According to Young, it appears that the suspected ICE vehicle was only coincidentally in the area and not targeting the school.

“It would be terrible for ICE to conduct any sort of enforcement around a school because we want families to think of schools as a safe space,” he said.

One of them rammed two ICE vehicles with his car, Charles said, and was arrested.
“Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — In what’s become an increasingly volatile deployment, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have made more than 400 arrests in Minnesota since so-called Operation Metro Surge began this month, an ICE spokesperson said.

NBC News was granted exclusive access to the operation Wednesday in the frigid Twin Cities, where the wind chill dropped well below freezing.

“The frigid temperatures means that people aren’t out and about as much, so it makes it a little tougher,” said Marcos Charles, the acting executive associate director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Details of the federal surge, which include around 100 ICE agents from around the country, had been sparse, prompting backlash, protests and threats. ICE requested that NBC News conceal the identities of most of its agents, who said protestors had tried to block in their vehicles at scenes and had aggressively tailed them, even attaching Apple AirTags to their vehicles to track their movements.

Throughout the day, NBC News witnessed multiple protestors going up to unmarked ICE vehicles and blowing whistles at the agents. One agent related an anecdote of an ICE agent’s evading a tailing car by using his military ID to enter a military base.

Trial and error

On Wednesday, agents left their staging area at a federal building in St. Paul by 6 a.m. The first target was a Somali immigrant who ICE said had been in the U.S. illegally since 2019 and had a previous conviction for criminal sexual conduct. The agents, in several vehicles, surrounded a home outside Minneapolis — and waited.

Within the hour, they made contact with someone inside the home: the man’s wife, who claimed he was staying elsewhere. Agents moved on to their next target, another Somali immigrant, but couldn’t locate him.

“It is not an operation targeting the Somali community,” Charles said. “We’re looking for people that are here illegally.”

Three hours later, after a burst of activity over the agency’s radio transmissions, another team, including agents from Florida and Texas, gathered around a residence, hoping to make an arrest and trying to determine whether their target was home. A crowd began to gather.

“Let’s get out of there,” an ICE official said over the radio with a curse and a sigh.

The operation was a constant, unrelenting sequence of trial and error, using previously gathered intelligence about targets to make arrests. Ideally, officers said, a person is taken into custody without incident. Many attempts don’t pan out, the day’s events showed and agents said, either because the suspect isn’t home or because other obstacles get in the way, such as persistent protestors or property managers who restrict ICE personnel’s movements within any given area.

At one location, ICE agents surrounded an apartment building attached to a business on the ground level. They were searching for a 68-year-old Somali who’d been convicted of criminal sexual contact with a minor and who agents believed was upstairs. The property manager wouldn’t let the ICE agents enter, so they had to abandon the plan.

Around noon, the agents arrived back at their staging area to regroup while another transport team brought in three undocumented immigrants from Ecuador who had just been taken into custody.

In a brief interview, one of the men, 32, told NBC News that he’d been arrested while he was trying to find work shoveling snow. He acknowledged he’d been convicted of drunk driving three years earlier but insisted he remained in the country to work and care for his family. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he’d be deported or how soon.

By the afternoon, agents got word that another ICE team had tried to stop a man in his car near his home in Burnsville, Minnesota. He apparently escaped and ran inside the home. The agents consulted with a government lawyer and got a warrant allowing them to forcefully enter the home. About an hour later, a special response tactical team with a battering ram broke through the door.

The initial target had fled the home, but ICE said another undocumented immigrant from Honduras who had been staying at the home was taken into custody. During the operation, protestors gathered nearby. One of them rammed two ICE vehicles with his car, Charles said, and was arrested.

‘Filthy dirty, disgusting’

Even though ICE agents insist they’re not specifically targeting the Somali community, President Donald Trump has been ramping up his criticism of Minnesota’s Somali community, by far the largest in the country. The vast majority are here legally, and many are U.S. citizens. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from railing against their African homeland.

“We always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster,” he said again Tuesday in Pennsylvania. “Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Trump escalated rhetoric after convictions involving dozens of members of Minnesota’s Somali community who, during the pandemic, stole millions of dollars in taxpayer money, some of it from programs providing meals to low-income children. The majority of those charged in the fraud are U.S. citizens.

State and city leaders in Minnesota have strongly argued that the scandal shouldn’t be used to insult all Somali immigrants.

“The mistakes of a few individuals can never be used to generalize or stereotype an entire community,” said Imam Hassan Jamma, executive director of the Islamic Association of North America.

A top adviser to Trump, however, isn’t limiting his attacks to a few individuals. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller — the administration’s immigration policy architect — was direct in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday in his xenophobic criticism of African countries specifically.

“You see with a lot of these immigrant groups, not only is the first generation unsuccessful — again, Somalia is a clear example here — not only is the first generation unsuccessful, but you see persistent issues in every subsequent generation,” Miller said. “You see consistent high rates of welfare use, consistent high rates of criminal activity, consistent failures to assimilate. This shouldn’t be a surprise.”

“There are people all over the world that are great people,” Miller added. “But you look at the society — if Libya keeps failing, if the Central African Republic keeps failing, if Somalia keeps failing, if these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself: If you bring those societies into our country and then give them unlimited free welfare, what do we think is going to happen?”

Growing backlash

“The biggest misconception is that we’re out there just randomly arresting people, which we’re not,” Charles said.

Firm numbers about how many “collateral arrests,” as DHS officials have described them, have occurred have been difficult to determine. During NBC News’ roughly eight hours with ICE, fewer than a dozen people were arrested despite not being the initial targets of the operation. They just happened to be at the scene when agents showed up.

In Minneapolis, as in other major cities where the Trump administration has surged resources, ICE has encountered concerted pushback from local leaders who have accused it of mistakenly taking U.S. citizens into custody.

On Wednesday, Minneapolis’ mayor and police chief alleged at a news conference that ICE agents wrongfully arrested a U.S. citizen because he looked Somali.

Standing alongside the city leaders, Mubashir, 20, who wanted to be identified only by his first name, said he was on his lunch break Tuesday when a masked man running full speed tackled him and pushed him into a restaurant.

“The agent then, at one point, he never identified himself, he didn’t say, ‘ICE, stop.’ I feel like I was getting assaulted, I was getting kidnapped,” Mubashir said.

DHS said ICE officers were speaking to someone nearby who they suspected was in the country illegally.

“At that time, a second male individual walked out of a nearby restaurant, turned around, and fled from law enforcement,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to NBC News. “Having reasonable suspicion--as protected under the U.S. Constitution--officers gave chase and caught up with the individual, who violently resisted officers and refused to answer questions.”

She added that the officers “temporarily detained” the person because a large crowd had gathered, presenting a threat to the officers’ safety.

“Once officers finished their questioning, he was promptly released,” McLaughlin wrote. “Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. Under the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses ‘reasonable suspicion’ to make arrests. If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement is trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability.”

Mubashir said that after the officers saw his passport hours later and became convinced that he was a U.S. citizen, they told him he was free to go. He asked whether they could take him back to where he was arrested, and he said they told him he could walk home in the snow.

“I apologize that this happened to you in my city, with people wearing vests that say ‘police,’” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. “That’s embarrassing.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251211-home-entry-ice-ride-along-gk-57183b.jpg",N,,2025-12-11 20:56:31.774229

The raids led to dozens of arrests across southern Arizona last week.

Taco Giro’s management confirmed that seven of its locations, primarily in and around Tucson, remained closed indefinitely following the raids, with the closures affecting staff, customers and surrounding communities, according to Green Valley News.

Newsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Taco Giro for comment via email outside office hours.

Why It Matters

The closures of several Taco restaurants are a byproduct of the Trump administration’s blueprint for mass deportations and strict immigration enforcement, which targets businesses employing undocumented workers. Business leaders have expressed concerns that widespread raids can exacerbate labor shortages in key sectors, disrupt local economies, and unsettle communities that rely on immigrant labor.

What To Know

Cesar Rodriguez, director of operations for Taco Giro, told Green Valley News that about 10 percent of the company's employees were detained by ICE.

He told the outlet that three Taco Giro locations have reopened, in Tucson on Valencia in Tuscon, Casa Grande and Sierra Vista, and that the chain plans to gradually reopen additional restaurants as it recruits and trains staff. He also said that the Country Club of Green Valley location lost about six employees, even though no agents ever visited that site.

""Basically, they corralled everyone in the homes where they were living, which was a couple of houses. And they came into the establishment to verify documentation and some questioning items what they were investigating on and pretty much that was it,"" Rodriguez told Green Valley News.

Rodriguez told the outlet that none of the detained employees have contacted the company, and their whereabouts remain unknown.

ICE Homeland Security Investigations Arizona and federal partners executed 16 search warrants in southern Arizona on December 5, part of what the agency described as a years‑long investigation of a ""transnational criminal organization involved in labor exploitation, tax violations, and immigration violations.""

The operation spanned multiple jurisdictions, including homes and businesses, and resulted in 46 arrests, according to ICE officials.

Rodriguez said accusations had been made that undocumented employees had been paid ""cash under the table.""

""There were a lot of false allegations that we were drug smuggling and child trafficking. It was just ridiculous,"" he added.

The presence of federal agents at several Taco Giro locations also sparked protests by residents and activists, some of whom attempted to block federal vehicles and question agents about the operation, according to the Marshall Project.

Video from local outlets show federal officers deploying chemical agents such as pepper spray and pepper balls to disperse crowds outside the restaurants.

During the confrontations, U.S. Representative Adelita Grijalva (D‑Ariz.), whose congressional district includes parts of Tucson, said she was pepper‑sprayed by an ICE agent when she approached the scene and identified herself while seeking information about the raids.

DHS disputed the Democratic lawmaker’s account, saying Grijalva was near someone who was sprayed and criticizing protestors for ""obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.""

What People Are Saying

Taco Giro wrote in a post on social media: ""Our restaurant will be temporarily closed. While we take a short pause to make a few necessary adjustments so we can continue offering the warm service and unique flavors you love, we truly appreciate your patience and your continued support during this time. We'll be ready to welcome you back very soon with the same love, passion, and flavors that always make you feel at home. Thank you for being part of our family.""

Acting Special Agent in Charge Ray Rede said in a press release issued by ICE: ""This multiyear investigation that targeted TCOs alleged to be involved in human smuggling, human trafficking derived from peonage resulted in the shutdown of the restaurants.

""These enforcement actions have unequivocally disrupted this criminal organization’s ability to exploit our lawful labor and system of commerce. This agency will not stand for it and those seeking to continue such practices are on notice — there will be more enforcement operations in Arizona.""

Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyer was also contacted for comment.

Mr Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the US illegally as a teenager.

An immigration judge in 2019 ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.

He was returned to the US under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

His lawsuit in federal court claims Mr Trump's administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.

Meanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, he is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States.

Additionally, he is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling.

He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.

A judge has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Mr Abrego Garcia ""may be vindictive.""

Two weeks ago, though, it was the protesters who surprised ICE.

Organizers had a feeling the authorities might take advantage of Thanksgiving weekend to stage their next raid. Their suspicion grew when volunteers who were patrolling Canal Street noticed early that morning on November 29 that there were more vehicles on the road than usual. They also observed that many cars were moving toward a garage nearby. “We would be able to tell that a raid was going to happen just based on the movement around Federal Plaza, because that is ICE headquarters,” says Samantha, a young organizer who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation from the federal government. Activists alerted each other in Signal chats to come to the garage, then issued a call for action to the public on social media. Samantha grabbed a mask, a hat, and 25 whistles and rushed downtown from Brooklyn.

By the time she arrived, about 50 people were blocking the garage’s exit. They locked arms and chanted, “ICE out of New York!” She handed out whistles to passersby, some of whom joined in. “Once people see with their own eyes, Oh, shit it’s happening here in my city, the feeling is a lot different than seeing it on their Instagram Reels or TikTok feed,” she says. Protesters dragged trash cans and wood pallets to put in the federal agents’ path. Others stood in front of government vans, stopping and slowing their progress all the way to Holland Tunnel, about a mile away. Julie DeLaurier, 69, locked eyes with one federal agent and said, “You don’t have to do this.” By the time the NYPD arrived a half-hour later, organizers say the protest had grown to some 200 people. Police eventually cleared a path for ICE to leave, using pepper spray on protesters and arresting more than a dozen people.

“These were all delay tactics — we didn’t interfere with any arrests — but the delays allowed word to spread, and they got no one. We did good work,” DeLaurier says.

DeLaurier and others were prepared to block federal agents after attending community events and protests organized by Hands Off NYC, a volunteer-run coalition that has become a key part of a broad, decentralized effort to defend New York from the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown seen in other cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and most recently New Orleans. The coalition includes two of the city’s largest immigrant-rights organizations, New York Immigration Coalition and Make the Road New York. Hannah Stauss, a co-founder of Hands Off NYC, says the group has trained thousands of volunteers in recent months; interest has recently surged to the point where more than 800 people are on a wait list. “Sometimes you trade high security for the ability to scale,” she says. “We always assume that we are infiltrated.” When Hands Off NYC isn’t training, its leaders are organizing, along with coalition members, mass demonstrations such as the city’s most recent No Kings protest.

When the first, successful Canal Street raid happened, immigration advocates got there largely after ICE had already detained street vendors, says Stauss, and there were half as many people as there were a month later. She attributes the faster response to the second operation, in part, to increasing vigilance across the city through more frequent neighborhood patrols performed by local residents. “A lot of it is growing to a point where ICE can’t move quietly in our city,” she says.

The patrols are mainly a response to changing tactics by authorities who are increasingly targeting immigrants on the streets. Activists are particularly vigilant about windows when immigrants are most vulnerable: returning to or leaving work, picking up or dropping off their children at school. It appears federal agents are venturing beyond the courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza, where they have detained immigrants there for routine court hearings. The move to the streets has opened up more creative possibilities to fight back. “You’re more likely to be around people who care,” says one protester who was on Canal Street last month. “If you’re in a federal building and trying to stop a kidnapping, there’s not a ton of people around you that you can call out for … in the same way you could on a street.”

On Saturday, about 1,000 participants signed up for a Hands Off NYC anti-ICE training at a Pentecostal church in Brooklyn. Nancy Campau, an 82-year-old grandmother, always saw herself as “kind of a goody two-shoes.” She came to the training to learn how to step in and document and distract federal agents if she witnessed them trying to detain one of her neighbors. “It would be hard, but I would,” she says. Going forward, she will wear a whistle around her neck to alert people to raids and will offer to walk children to school if their parents are fearful of ICE.

The crowd at Saturday’s training was mostly white. “To put it frankly, old white people have a lot of time, and they’re really angry,” Stauss said. “Having somebody that looks like your grandmother out there, shouting ‘shame’ or out there blowing her whistle, is really important.” Stauss also said they have community buy-in from coalition members, like the NAACP and the Street Vendor Project. “Part of it is about asking how we can show up to support them, instead of asking people who are at greater risk to show up on the streets,” she says.

Trainers ran through scenarios, like ICE grabbing a parent who is dropping their child off to school. They laid out best practices for reporting, recording, and documenting ICE actions, including “using all your personal strength to not use expletives to describe what’s happening.” They cracked open studies about what it takes to topple authoritarian regimes and shared what they learned from other cities, such as adopting Chicago activists’ ideas to use whistles and to report activity on a hotline.

One of the biggest lessons Hands Off NYC learned is the importance of a neighborhood-led rapid-response structure. “That is definitely something we learned from other cities, where we felt like we’re maybe a little behind,” says Hae-Lin Choi, another co-founder of Hands Off NYC. Keya Chatterjee, executive director of Free DC, explains that Washington activists realized they weren’t able to react fast enough without training residents in neighborhoods being targeted by ICE. “This is not the kind of situation where you can have a centralized group that can get to where the issue is,” she says.

Activists in New York say more than 500 people patrol at least 20 neighborhoods daily, led by an autonomous patchwork of people who operate separately from public-facing groups like Hands Off. One of them is Samantha, who signed up for a shift to patrol part of Bushwick on Monday evening, checking multiple Signal chats for updates. She usually walks alone, but others are patrolling nearby at the same time. “The more eyes you have in all areas, the more likely you are to suspect things and the quicker people can converge to get together if there’s a sighting,” she says.

At every intersection, Samantha looks both ways, trying to spot clues. In Bushwick, she says federal agents often huddle at the parking lots by White Castle and Food Bazaar before any enforcement action. They also transfer the immigrants they detain into cars at these locations. Those on ICE patrol look for cars and vans moving in groups, especially if they aren’t personalized, have tinted windows or no license-plate covers, or are double or illegally parked. This night, there is no sign of ICE activity, although the corner of Irving Avenue and Harman Street, right outside a public school, had remnants of a previous encounter. A large warning is painted in red on a white concrete road barrier: “ICE ABDUCTION HERE,” accompanied by the date, September 13.

Samantha has been demonstrating since she was in middle school, first over gun control and climate, then joined Black Lives Matter marches in 2020. More recently, she was part of the pro-Palestinian student-encampment movement. The years of experience make her a seasoned veteran at a young age, but even she is terrified about what the Trump administration reportedly has planned for people like her. A leaked Justice Department memo noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi is ordering the FBI to “compile a list of groups or entities engaging in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism,” including opposing law and immigration enforcement and harboring “extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders.”

“We know ICE is not going to slow down,” Samantha says. “It’s undeniably scary — but people are more likely to be courageous when they have a resilient social structure that has their back.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/923/d9d/a0055703a58fb9752c6a9aed9bd1ab898d-Canal-Ice-lead.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 20:56:35.725332

Juarez said she believes legislators have the right under state law to visit the state-run facility unannounced, but won’t pass up the group tour opportunity.
Dorn said he had communicated with Cavanaugh a few times since she was rejected for entry to the McCook facility.
“I personally don’t think I see any violation of state law,” said Hansen, a Republican.","LINCOLN — Two days after a Democratic Nebraska lawmaker publicly criticized Republican Gov. Jim Pillen’s administration for denying her entrance to a controversial state-run ICE detention facility, all 49 officially nonpartisan state senators received an invite to a group “walkthrough” next week.

Notice of the Dec. 15 group tour of the former McCook Work Ethic Camp, which recently was converted to a jail for migrants awaiting deportation by the federal government, came via email Wednesday from State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, who heads the Legislature’s Oversight Committee.

Dorn told the Nebraska Examiner that conversations about a tour had been ongoing with State Sen. John Arch, speaker of the Legislature, and Pillen’s team since State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha notified him in mid-November that she was turned away from the McCook detention center.

Dorn, a Republican, said all senators were notified late Wednesday afternoon after details had been solidified.

Cavanaugh still concerned

Cavanaugh said Thursday a group tour does nothing to calm her biggest concern — that legislative oversight authority embedded in state law was disregarded when she was turned away.

She is uncertain whether she will participate, saying a pre-scheduled walkthrough won’t offer a “real view of what the day to day looks like.” If she goes, Cavanaugh said, it would be to address part of her intent: to show detainees that elected officials are paying attention.

The group invite came also as State Sen. Margo Juarez separately notified state officials of her intent to visit the McCook facility on Dec. 15. The Democratic lawmaker from South Omaha said she formally alerted the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Dec. 8, and prior to that had left messages at the McCook center.

She said she had yet to hear back when she received Dorn’s email.

Juarez said she believes legislators have the right under state law to visit the state-run facility unannounced, but won’t pass up the group tour opportunity.

“My goal is to get in there,” she said.

Juarez had visited the McCook center in September when it was winding down as WEC, and vowed to return in the future to check out conditions.

Cavanaugh said she had yet to get a response to her Monday letter in which she asked Dorn and State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, to defend the legislative branch’s authority.

Nebraska lawmaker was twice denied entry to McCook ICE jail, calls it law violation

Her letter underscored the state law that says legislators can enter a state facility “at any time.” She asserts that the Pillen administration violated state law in turning her away twice, Nov. 12 and 13.

Both Dorn and Hansen on Thursday said a lawmaker’s access becomes questionable in the case of the McCook jail because it now houses federal, not state, detainees. Dorn said he expects legislation to be introduced in the coming legislative session that would clarify the access question.

Dorn and Hansen in separate interviews said they would reexamine Cavanaugh’s Monday letter to determine if further response is needed. Dorn said he had communicated with Cavanaugh a few times since she was rejected for entry to the McCook facility.

“I personally don’t think I see any violation of state law,” said Hansen, a Republican. “But we’re still looking at the situation to make sure.”

No media

Cavanaugh argues that the state contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot supersede state law. A Pillen spokesperson said previously that the governor’s team interprets the law differently, particularly as it relates to the McCook facility and the contract with the federal government.

Thursday, Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said senators who want to be part of the tour are required to complete and submit the appropriate federal form to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services by the close of business Friday, so the forms can be transmitted to representatives of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE prior to the Dec. 15 visit.

“Now that the detention facility has been up and running successfully for some time, it is a good time for senators to come and see first-hand the operational aspects of the detention facility,” Strimple said.

Asked whether news media can participate, the Governor’s Office said the tour is exclusive to state senators.

Migrants began to arrive last month to the former WEC, a facility that remains owned and staffed by the state. The federal government is paying Nebraska for its use as a Midwest ICE hub. Up to 300 undocumented men and women eventually could be held there as they await deportation, state officials have said.

The contractual arrangement came after the Pillen administration reached out to President Donald Trump’s administration to offer assistance in the president’s ramped up immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts.

The Dorn email says senators will be responsible for their own transportation to McCook, and a representative of the Governor’s Office will be at the facility as well.

Dorn plans to participate in the tour. Hansen said he had a prior engagement.

“Any potential visitors who have not submitted the appropriate paperwork will not be admitted to the facility,” the email said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wec_thumbnail-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 22:56:34.765511

Donald Trump may push to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, according to a Washington Post report citing six unnamed people familiar with the discussions.

The newspaper said the changes could include reducing oversight of marijuana and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers. The moves would not legalize or decriminalize marijuana, but rather reduce obstacles to research and help support legal businesses, according to the report.

A White House official told the paper that no final decisions have been made, and other US agencies did not immediately comment. The report noted that the president previously said he was “looking at reclassification”, saying, “Some people like it, some people hate it.”

Trump signs AI executive order meant to block state restrictions

Trump has signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that aims to block laws that limit AI and restrict states from regulating the technology.

At a signing ceremony, the president praised AI companies investing in the US, saying, “If they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you could forget it … We want to have one central source of approval.”

Trump’s order calls for the US attorney general to establish an AI “litigation task force” that would be responsible for challenging state laws. Republicans earlier this year failed to pass a moratorium meant to prevent new state AI laws for ten years.

State leaders and civil liberties groups across the country have pushed back against Trump’s order, arguing it would empower corporations while hampering efforts to reduce the harmful consequences of AI.

Trump declines to commit to US attendance at Ukraine meeting

Donald Trump declined to commit that the US would send a representative to participate in Ukraine talks in Europe this weekend.

“We’ll see whether or not we attend the meeting,” the president said in the Oval Office, Reuters reported. “We’ll be attending the meeting on Saturday in Europe if we think there’s a good chance. And we don’t want to waste a lot of time if we think it’s negative.”

His waffling comes after he hinted earlier this week that he could walk away from supporting Ukraine and called for the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to accept his proposal to cede territory to Russia.

Trump’s press secretary earlier today said it was “still up in the air” whether the US believed “real peace can be accomplished”, adding, “The president is extremely frustrated with both sides of this war, and he is sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.”

Trump claims pardon for Tina Peters, but doesn't have power to free her

Donald Trump wrote on social media that he was granting a “full pardon” for Tina Peters, a convicted Colorado election clerk, even though he does not have authority to pardon or free her as she is serving a sentence on state charges.

Peters, the former Mesa county clerk, was convicted last year for her role in breaching election data in search of evidence of fraud and sentenced to nine years.

Trump has repeatedly called for her release and threatened earlier this year to take “harsh measures” if she was not freed. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform this evening: “Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the ‘crime’ of demanding Honest Elections. Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!”

Presidential pardons, however, do not apply to state convictions. Jared Polis, Colorado’s Democratic governor, who does have clemency authority in her case, has said he won’t pardon her.

Trump warns of land strikes on Venezuela drug shipments

Donald Trump again suggested that the US would “soon” carry out land strikes on drug shipments in Venezuela, which would mark a dramatic escalation of his campaign against Nicolás Maduro.

Defending his administration’s strikes against boats that allegedly have ties to drug trafficking, the president claimed “drug traffic by sea is down by 92%”. The source and context of that figure was unclear, and Trump continued by saying: “Nobody can figure out who the 8% is.” He then added: “We’ll start that on land, too. It’s going to be starting on land pretty soon.”

Trump has repeatedly warned of potential land attacks, but his administration has not offered further details. His comments come as his administration is facing increasing scrutiny over its seizure of an oil tanker.

Trump attacks Indiana GOP Senate leader: 'I hope he loses'

Donald Trump has criticized Rod Bray, the Republican state senate leader of Indiana, after GOP representatives rejected a redistricting measure.

The White House had supported the proposed redrawing of the congressional map, with the president threatening to support primary opponents of Republicans who voted against redistricting.

Asked about the vote, Trump responded: “I wasn’t working on it very hard. It would’ve been nice … You had one gentleman … Bray, whatever his name is, I heard he was against it. He’ll probably lose his next primary. I hope he does. He’s done a tremendous disservice.”

Republican infighting over Indiana redistricting vote

Republicans in Indiana and across the country are sparring over the state GOP’s rare break with Donald Trump with lawmakers’ vote against redistricting.

Earlier today, Republican state lawmakers rejected an effort to redraw Indiana’s congressional map, with a plan that would have added two more GOP-friendly seats to Congress.

Mike Braun, Indiana’s GOP governor, wrote on social media after the vote that he was “very disappointed that a small group of misguided State Senators have partnered with Democrats to reject this opportunity to protect Hoosiers with fair maps and to reject the leadership of President Trump”. The decision, he said, would “carry political consequences”, adding he would work with Trump to “challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers”.

Meanwhile, Kevin Kiley, a GOP congressman from California, applauded Indiana Republicans for “taking a principled stand against mid-decade gerrymandering and rejecting the ‘eye for an eye’ mentality that has caused this redistricting war to spin out of control”. Kiley’s district is due to be redrawn under California Democrats’ redistricting that was launched in response to Texas’ gerrymandering.

Earlier this week, Trump threatened to support primaries against Republicans in Indiana who opposed redistricting. GOP state senator Spencer Deery criticized the outside pressures, telling the AP, “The federal government should not dictate by threat or other means what should happen in our states.”

JD Vance, the vice president, attacked Rod Bray, the Senate leader in Indiana, accusing Bray of telling the administration he would support redistricting while fighting against it behind the scenes.

“That level of dishonesty cannot be rewarded, and the Indiana GOP needs to choose a side,” Vance said.

Indiana Republicans’ rejection of a redistricting effort that would have favored the GOP marks a major break from Donald Trump and comes after the president threatened to back primary opponents for those who didn’t support the redrawn congressional maps.

“Anybody that votes against Redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C., will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA Primary in the Spring,” Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday, the day before the vote. “Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.”

Late last month, Michael Bohacek, a Republican Indiana state senator, announced he was opposing redistricting after Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to insult a political opponent. Bohacek, whose child has down syndrome, said he was an “unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities” and the president’s “choices of words have consequences”.

Heritage Action, a conservative 501(c)4 associated with the group behind Project 2025, also suggested before the vote that Indiana Republicans would suffer if they didn’t support the redrawn maps, writing on social media, “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”

US targets Nicolás Maduro's family with new sanctions

The US has issued new sanctions targeting the family members of Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, and six crude oil tankers, Reuters reports.

The US treasury department announced sanctions against three nephews of Maduro’s wife and oil tankers and shipping companies allegedly linked to them.

The targeted oil tankers “have engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”. The sanctions come as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its pressure campaign against Maduro, including with the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker.

Democrats and others have criticized the administration over its boat strikes and the seizure, warning the US was “sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.

Trump administration creates new militarized zone along California border

Victoria Bekiempis

The US’s southern border is poised to become more militarized following an announcement by Trump administration officials that armed forces would now oversee 760 acres of public land for a three-year period.

The US Department of Interior said in a statement that jurisdiction over this acreage – located in California’s San Diego and Imperial counties – would be transferred to the US navy “to establish a National Defense Area to support ongoing border security operations”.

Expansive portions of the border region have been deemed militarized zones since April. This designation permits US military members to capture migrants and those whom they allege are illegally on US army, navy or air force bases, according to the AP. The classification also enables more criminal charges which, in turn, could mean greater prison terms. AP notes that more than 7,000 service members have been sent to the US border, as well as military surveillance equipment.

'Shoving Americans off a cliff': Democrats condemn ACA vote

Democrats have forcefully condemned Republicans over the failure to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits, with votes today that threaten to increase healthcare costs to unaffordable levels for millions of Americans.

The US Senate earlier rejected competing proposals that would have addressed the approaching expiration of subsidies for plans under the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Premium tax credits for roughly 21.8m enrollees of the plans are on track to expire by the end of December. A bill supported by Democrats laying out a three-year extension failed, with only four Republicans supporting.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, said:

Senate Republicans just shoved the American people off the side of a cliff with no parachute and with an anchor tied to their feet. Republicans just blocked the Democrats’ bill for a clean, simple extension of the ACA tax credits, the last chance they had to ensure people’s premiums do not skyrocket in the coming months.

Republicans, Schumer added, were “fighting like hell to kick people off insurance … [and] give sweet giveaways to billionaires and the ultra-rich”.

Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, said the Republicans’ proposal was a “cruel joke”. Republicans, she said in a video message, “never wanted to lower healthcare costs in the first place”.

Seth Magaziner confronting her with a veteran on Zoom who he said had been issued a removal order.

Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island, cited cases of veterans and military families facing removal or prolonged detention. After Noem said no veterans have been deported. Magaziner featured one such veteran, Sae Joon Park, over Zoom. In June, the U.S. Army veteran and green card holder self-deported to South Korea after Magaziner said he was issued a removal order related to drug possession charges and failure to appear in court from over 15 years ago.

""You say you're going after the worst of the worst — violent criminals who are breaking our laws,"" Magaziner said in an extended exchange, before adding that records and media reports show ICE has arrested tens of thousands of people with no criminal convictions, including U.S. citizens and longtime residents with deep ties to the military. Magaziner argued that deporting veterans and their families ""is not what the American people think they signed up for"" when they hear Noem's talking points about hardened criminals.

Noem pushed back, insisting her department is enforcing the law as written and that those unhappy with recent deportations should direct their anger at Congress, not the Department of Homeland Security. At one point during the hearing, she bristled that lawmakers were berating her for following statutes they themselves wrote, saying if they don't like the outcomes, they should ""change the law.""

The panel's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, opened the hearing with a scathing personal rebuke of the DHS secretary before urging her to resign from her post.

""Instead of deploying homeland security grants to protect churches and synagogues, you handed your friends a $220 million contract so they could follow you around the country with a camera,"" Thompson claimed in an apparent reference to a Pro Publica report. Thompson accused Noem, who currently resides in a military home typically reserved for the U.S. Coast Guard's top admiral, of living ""rent free in a taxpayer-owned property that is supposed to be reserved for military leaders.""

""Every penny that you spend on yourself represents the blood, sweat and tears of hardworking Americans who expect their tax dollars to be spent on homeland security, not promoting you and your interests,"" Thompson said.

The ranking member later pressed Noem on who gave asylum to the Afghan national who has now been accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. ""Your D.H.S. approved the asylum application,"" Thompson told her. Noem repeatedly said that the vetting of the suspect occurred during the Biden administration.

During the questioning, Thompson called the shooting an ""unfortunate accident,"" prompting Noem to fire back that it was ""a terrorist attack.""

Following the Nov. 26 attack, the Department of Homeland Security halted processing of Afghan visas and froze decisions on asylum applications. The administration has also indefinitely suspended entry for foreign nationals from 19 countries ""of concern"" that were included in President Trump's travel ban.

Taking stock of recent European policy developments in the field of asylum and migration, most prominently the recent Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council meeting, requires a clear head as new lows have been reached in terms of respect for fundamental rights. Here is an overview.

1. Balancing responsibility and solidarity: the forgotten ‘humanity’ factor

The overall ambition for solidarity in 2026 has been set at 21,000 relocations or other solidarity efforts or EUR 420 million in financial contributions. The countries that the European Commission (EC) found to be “under migratory pressure” and which can therefore benefit from the solidarity pool are Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain. A separate group of countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia and Poland) have been identified as facing a “significant migratory situation” due to the cumulative migratory pressure of the previous years. They have the possibility to request a full or partial deduction from their contributions to the solidarity pool. A third group of countries considered to be “at risk” of migratory pressure will have priority access to the EU Migration Support Toolbox which includes assistance by EU agencies and support from EU funds.

While it is positive that the EC has recognised most Mediterranean countries as being under pressure, the extent to which they can actually benefit from solidarity measures will be dependent on the evaluation of whether their asylum and reception systems suffer from systemic shortcomings, and this has been postponed until 2026 when the full system will become operational. For countries such as Italy and Greece, this means that they are expected to resolve obstacles to accepting people returned under Dublin; in Italy’s case, a declared suspension of incoming Dublin transfers.

The agreement on the solidarity pool is positive as it finally signals that the solidarity side of the Pact is receiving attention. Whether the promise of solidarity will be delivered on in reality remains to be seen. Likewise, whether the question of assessing the shortcomings of EU member states’ (MS) systems goes beyond the limited question of Dublin transfers to a more comprehensive assessment of compliance with EU asylum rules is also uncertain.

Of course, the establishment of the solidarity pool has to be seen in the overall context of the Pact and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR) which preserves the system in which the allocation of responsibility rests largely with the MS of first entry and, therefore, inherits many of the structural problems of the current Dublin system. ECRE’s recent statistical update on Dublin highlights its various flaws. The solidarity mechanism is nothing more than an attempted corrective layer on top of an unfair system; the chance of a fundamental overhaul of the responsibility rules has been missed.

While allowing different forms of contribution to count as solidarity may make the mechanism more workable, it also (1) dilutes what “solidarity” means in practice and may reduce the impact for both applicants and MS under pressure; and (2) provides for a quasi-permanent negotiation of MS’ contributions on which the solidarity mechanism relies, which is not favourable to mutual trust between them. Focusing on the forms of solidarity that involve individuals would be key to addressing this. Both the primary form of solidarity (i.e. relocations) and responsibility offsets should remain the priority (rather than defaulting to financial or capacity support). Ensuring transparency on the choices made and criteria used by MS is equally important. For instance, financial contributions or capacity support could be directed to support border control or develop infrastructure, rather than improving reception or access to rights.

2. The strategy of limiting access to protection for refugees in Europe is further embodied

A general approach was found for all of the legislative proposals on the agenda of the recent JHA Council meeting. The files under discussion were (1) two amendments to the Asylum Procedure Regulation (APR) that seek to mainstream and expand the “safe country” concepts (i.e. safe country of origin (SCO), safe third country (STC) and first country of asylum) as instruments for harmonising and accelerating asylum processing across MS and, (2) the proposal for a Return Regulation.

2.1 Safe countries and territories: a theory of relativity

In substance, the Council added new aggravating measures to the various major issues already identified with the amendments to the APR. These include the presumption that all EU candidate countries and several additional third countries are considered “safe” despite well-documented human rights risks for several groups of their nationals, and the weakening of both the connection criterion and of appeal rights.

New additions regarding SCOs include:

adjustments to the exclusion criteria for SCOs that would allow MS to treat applications from nationals of Türkiye and Ukraine under accelerated procedures;

a process allowing the EC to assess if a country of origin is partially safe (i.e. specific parts of its territory) or only for certain categories of people (provided the categories are clearly identifiable);

a clarification that the 20% rule – a ground for procedural acceleration of applications made by nationals who do not reach a 20% recognition rate – relates to a recognition rate at first instance;

allowing MS to frontload SCO as a ground for acceleration from the date of approval of the text.

New additions regarding STCs include:

a broad definition of transit (passing through or being at the border or in a transit zone would constitute transit);

the possibility of applying the STC concept not only based on an agreement between MS but also on a non-binding arrangement providing it contains provisions requiring the examination of the merits of any request for effective protection (irrespective of the case processing modalities, including simplified, group or prima facie procedures);

application of the STC concept to unaccompanied children in case either the transit or connection criteria applies;

the lack of an automatic right to remain on the territory of a MS when an appeal is lodged against an inadmissibility decision when the applicant is holding a protection status in another MS.

2.2 Agreements on returns: humanity at a loss or lost humanity

The EC’s proposal for a Return Regulation already marked a significant step backwards by weakening safeguards, introducing more punitive measures and further narrowing the space for rights-based approaches within the EU return framework (see ECRE’s detailed analysis on the proposal here and a summary here). The Council’s position suggests that MS should be able to effectively frontload a series of provisions (e.g. expansion of countries of return, establishment of return hubs and mutual recognition of return decisions) while the rest of the Regulation would only come into effect two years later.

The list of provisions on which the wide political consensus was achieved could fill a reader with dread:

potentially indefinite immigration detention, up to 30 months per MS, including for children;

optional alternatives for detention, limited to three options ((1) financial guarantees by returnees; (2) electronic monitoring; and (3) measures provided by national law;

no requirement to determine the country of return in the return decision;

broadened grounds and scope for issuing an entry ban;

far-reaching duties on individuals to continuously demonstrate co-operation (e.g. pending financial penalties, reduction in support intended for reintegration after removal and even criminal detention);

broadened search and visit powers for authorities, including possibility to confiscate personal items, home inspections…;

weakened assessment of non-refoulement risk during appeal process (e.g. no more ex officio obligations, possibility of effective removal while an appeal is pending, possibility of return decisions being issued even where there is a risk of violation of the principle of non-refoulement (provided the effective removal is suspended)).

The European Parliament’s (EP) Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) adopted its position on the APR amendments in early December with the support of a coalition of the European People’s Party (EPP) and the far-right groups, the so-called ‘Venezuela coalition’, effectively breaching the cordon sanitaire that has existed in the EP for decades. For both the SCO and the STC file, the EP’s position is extremely close to that of the Council, leaving very little hope that any of the multiple risks to people’s ability to access to asylum in Europe will be addressed during the trilogue.

That said, there is an ongoing attempt to challenge the EP’s draft reports in next week’s plenary which should be supported by all MEPs who are committed to protecting access to asylum in Europe.

On the Return Regulation, the Council’s position diverges significantly from the EC’s proposal and even more so from the EP’s draft report which is currently being discussed in the LIBE Committee. The hope here is that the rapporteur will seek to form a majority with progressive parties.

3. Denying the fundamental rights, manufacturing the disenfranchised

Keeping a clear head, one would state the obvious: while MS claim the European ‘new comprehensive approach to migration (…) should go hand in hand with full respect for fundamental rights’, the means they consistently choose to achieve their declared goals are what have been documented for decades as the most detrimental to fundamental rights: extended deprivation of liberty as a default setting, accelerated procedures, limited access to legal support and reduced appeal rights, detection of vulnerabilities by means of a written form, jeopardising legal certainty by allowing partial frontloading… This is the final demonstration of many MS’ strong taste for performativity when it comes to upholding the fundamental rights of people on the move.

We are all left with the question of the sheer compatibility of these provisions with regional and international legal frameworks, from Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights to which the EU is a party, including the whole the EU acquis and the very ius cogens nature of the non-refoulement principle. Not to mention the question of implementation and how all actors involved at national level will manage to operate the more than 5000 pages of new legislation by 12 June 2026, amidst the multiple options for frontloading bits and pieces of each new legal instrument.",https://ecre.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-ecre-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-11 18:57:49.789153

Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan this spring with obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. They allege she showed 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom through a back door when she learned federal authorities were in the courthouse looking to arrest him.

Dugan is set to stand trial beginning Monday in the latest show of force in the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown. She faces up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts.

Here’s what to know about the case, jury selection and the trial:

FBI: Angry Dugan orchestrated escape attempt

According to an FBI affidavit, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the United States from Mexico in 2013. Agents learned that he had been charged in state court with battery in March and was scheduled to appear in front of Dugan on April 18.

Agents traveled to the courthouse to arrest Flores-Ruiz after the hearing. A public defender noticed the agents in the corridor and told Dugan’s clerk about them. Dugan grew angry, according to the affidavit, declared the situation “absurd” and approached with another judge. Dugan argued with the agents over whether their warrant was valid and told them to speak to the chief judge.

Dugan returned to her courtroom, told Flores-Ruiz to come with her and led him and his attorney out a back jury door to the public corridor outside the courtroom, the affidavit says. Agents on their way back from the chief judge’s office spotted Flores-Ruiz, but he made it outside. He was eventually captured after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November that he had been deported.

Dugan defenders scouring jury pool for bias

Democrats insist President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to its immigration crackdown.

The administration, for its part, has been vilifying Dugan on social media. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of her being led out of the courthouse in handcuffs and the Department of Homeland Security posted that Dugan has taken the term activist judge “to a whole new meaning.”

Dugan told police she found a threatening flyer from an anti-government group at her home and at her mother and sister’s homes four days after Flores-Ruiz was captured.

Dugan’s attorneys have said they’re worried publicity about the case has tainted the jury pool. They sent a questionnaire to prospective jurors this fall in an effort to gauge their political involvement and leanings, asking whether they belong to political organizations, what radio shows and podcasts they follow, and what stickers, signs and patches they have on their cars, water bottles, backpacks and laptops.

Attorneys on both sides have already agreed to strike 44 prospective jurors, online court records show. A group of 40 prospective jurors was scheduled to show up Thursday morning at the federal courthouse in Milwaukee and fill out yet another questionnaire about whether their views have changed since they completed the first survey. Attorneys plan to spend the day questioning them in person.

The lawyers are prepared to bring in more prospective jurors on Friday if necessary.

Questions of immunity and protocol

Dugan’s defense team has argued that she’s immune from prosecution because she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore had “no consciousness of wrongdoing, no wrongfulness, no deception,” according to their filings.

Her attorneys tried to persuade presiding Judge Lynn Adelman to dismiss the case in August on those grounds. The judge refused, saying that there’s no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution.

Dugan also has argued that she was following protocols and did not intend to disrupt agents. According to her arguments, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley sent out a draft policy on immigration arrests in the courthouse about a week before Flores-Ruiz was arrested. The policy barred agents from executing administrative warrants in nonpublic courthouse areas and required court personnel to immediately refer any immigration agents to a supervisor, which Dugan did.

Dugan further contends that Ashley denied the agents permission to arrest Flores-Ruiz in the courtroom or the hallway. The agents then abandoned their plan to arrest him in the building and instead followed him outside so they could arrest him on the street, according to Dugan.

“(Dugan) was trying to ascertain, and follow, the rules,” her attorneys argued ahead of the trial.

Under federal guidance issued Jan. 21, immigration agents may carry out enforcement actions in or near courthouses if they believe someone they are trying to find will be there.

Immigration agents are generally required to let their internal legal office know ahead of time to make sure there are no legal restrictions, and are supposed to carry out arrests in nonpublic areas whenever possible, coordinate with court security and minimize impact on court operations.

Clinton appointed the judge presiding over the case

President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, appointed Adelman to the federal bench in 1997. A Wisconsin native, he served as a state senator for 20 years. He also worked as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Wisconsin and as a Columbia University Law School researcher. He’s now 86 years old.

He struck down Wisconsin’s voter photo identification law in 2014, calling it an unfair burden on poor and minority voters. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the law later that year, however.

Adelman also wrote an article in 2020 accusing the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts of eroding democracy.",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2025/05/Dugan-051525-AP-w.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 23:56:58.058962

The “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland” hearing was a deviation from past events in many respects.

FBI Director Kash Patel did not testify, instead sending a stand-in, while Noem was heckled by protesters as she left the hearing an hour early.

While she said she was leaving to attend a different meeting, that event was canceled, prompting Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee to suggest she may have misled the panel. That sparked their subpoena bid to compel her return.

And while the hearing traditionally has had a greater focus on threats posed by terrorism and extremism, Trump administration officials spent much of the time issuing warnings about immigration.

Here are four things to know.

Sparring over Afghans

Noem and Joe Kent, a former congressional candidate now running the National Counterterrorism Center, both highlighted immigration from Afghanistan as among the threats facing the homeland after an Afghan who served in a U.S.-backed unit shot two National Guard members, killing one.

“The terrorist who shot them was an Afghan national who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome,” Noem said before listing the recent arrests of two other Afghans, calling the matter among the “despicable examples that unfortunately are becoming too common.”

Kent called the arrival of Afghans “probably the top terrorist threat that we face right now.”

Kent said 2,000 Afghans who entered the U.S. after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan have terrorist ties and claimed without evidence that prior vetting done on the shooter was used as a “ruse.”

“The individual was vetted to serve as a soldier in Afghanistan, and that vetting standard was used by the Biden administration as a ruse to bring him here. Had we followed the standard operating procedures for Special Immigrant Visas, that individual and none of the Allies Welcome people would have come to America. That’s on Joe Biden,” he said.

Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), the top Democrat on the panel, disputed that the accused shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, wasn’t vetted, noting that he underwent a second round of review when he was approved for asylum under the Trump administration.

However, Thompson came under criticism himself for initially saying the shooting was an “unfortunate mistake.”

“You think that was an unfortunate accident?” Noem said with dismay. “It was a terrorist attack.”

“It was an unfortunate situation,” Thompson said, “but you blamed it solely on Joe Biden.”

“I don’t want to bring perjury charges against you, but I’m of the opinion that the Trump administration DHS [Department of Homeland Security], your DHS, approved the asylum application,” he added.

Thompson was later taken to task by Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) for his comments.

“Mr. Chairman, that was a murder that took place in D.C. It was not an unfortunate incident. And those comments are effing disrespectful,” he said.

Disputes over immigrants

The Charles Dickens novel “A Tale of Two Cities” featured prominently as both parties sparred over whether the Trump administration’s immigration policies should be celebrated or denigrated.

“The Democrats see it as the worst of times, but I see it really as the best of times,” said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who argued poor control of the border by the Biden administration allowed unvetted migrants to enter the country.

“That was the worst of times. Let me go to the best of times — most secure border I’ve seen in my 22 years in Congress, and I’ve dealt with this for a long time. … The daily crossings are 95 percent down from the prior administration. That’s the best of times — zero catch and release.”

Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) riffed on McCaul’s framing.

“This is ‘A Tale of Two Cities.’ Under Secretary Noem, the Trump administration — you’re going after the worst of the worst criminals. … The problem is 70 percent of the people you’ve arrested have no criminal record. You’re going after noncriminal immigrants,” he said.

Noem defended the Trump administration’s immigration policies, once again describing high immigration levels as an “invasion” and listing the risks of immigration as the greatest threat facing the country.

“Mr. Chairman, what keeps me up at night is that we don’t necessarily know all of the people that are in this country, who they are and what their intentions are,” Noem said.

“What keeps me up at night is the individuals that are in this country that wish to do us harm.”

Kent also attacked migrants when asked by Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) about those who “openly reject assimilation.”

“We simply won’t have a country anymore as we know it,” Kent said.

Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) accused Noem of “fueling bigotry” with her comments and by taking illegal actions to broadly target immigrants.

“Today’s hearing is supposed to be about worldwide threats. But Madam Secretary, under your watch, the threat is coming from inside the building,” said McIver, who is currently facing what she has described as politicized charges after she was arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

“Because when DHS, the department charged with keeping Americans safe, is called breaking the law, lying to the American public, systematically dismantling oversight, fueling bigotry and targeting vulnerable communities, trust is broken.”

Noem was confronted a the hearing by guests invited by Democrats who were intended to highlight the risk of Trump administration immigration policies.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.), for example, invited a South Korean man who served in the U.S. military but who was deported back to South Korea under President Trump. He also invited the veteran spouse of a woman who is a legal permanent resident who remains in detention facing deportation after writing two bad checks 10 years ago.

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) also accused the Trump administration of violating the law by arresting those showing up in immigration court for their asylum hearings, noting that those who seek the protection have legal status.

And Rep. Julie Johnson (D-Texas) said immigration officers were conducting racial profiling.

“You can’t just snatch somebody walking into a coffee shop because of the color of their skin,” she said. “There’s no probable cause for that.”

FEMA and Noem’s early exit

Noem left the “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland” hearing early, telling the committee she had to depart to attend a meeting of the FEMA Council as the Trump administration seeks to diminish the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Thompson later moved to subpoena Noem to reappear before the panel, saying she shirked her duties and may have even lied about needing to attend the FEMA meeting.

“I understand on good information that the FEMA council meeting was canceled so there was no need for her to go,” Thompson said, referencing the meeting to determine the future of the agency.

“She was a liar with no respect for congressional oversight.”

Noem left the witness table a few minutes after noon for the FEMA Council meeting that was slated to begin at 1 p.m., which The Hill independently verified had been canceled.

Thompson mentioned Noem also spent time in the committee’s anteroom after leaving the witness table, suggesting she did not immediately head to her next meeting.

“The Secretary found out at 12:26 p.m. that the meeting was cancelled,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Republicans voted down Thompson’s motion to again call her before the committee.

Noem had said earlier in the hearing that she would be heading to the FEMA Council meeting.

“I have to actually leave this hearing early, because the FEMA Review Council is giving their report today on suggestions for changes to FEMA. I have to co-chair it, but I will be leaving soon to have to go do that,” Noem said.

A struggle to answer questions over antifa

Michael Glasheen, a longtime FBI agent serving as operations director of the National Security Branch, struggled to answer questions from Thompson about why the Trump administration had determined antifa was a domestic terror organization.

“We share the same view. When you look at the data right now, you look at the domestic terrorist threat that we’re facing right now, what I see from my position, is that’s the most immediate violent threat that we’re facing on the domestic side,” Glasheen said.

Thompson asked where the group was headquartered and then when Glasheen hesitated asked, “Where in the United States does antifa exist?”

“We are building out the infrastructure right now,” Glasheen said.

“What does that mean?” Thompson asked. “We’re trying to get information. You said antifa is a terrorist organization. Tell us, as a committee, how did you come to that? Do they exist? How many members do they have in the United States as of right now?”

“Well, that’s very fluid,” Glasheen said.

“Sir, I just want you to tell us — if you said antifa is the No. 1 domestic terrorist organization operating in the United States, I just need to know where they are … how many people have you identified with the FBI that antifa is made of,” Thompson asked.

“Well the investigations are active,” Glasheen responded.

Thompson suggested the FBI had failed to establish why those opposed to fascism deserved to be labeled as domestic terrorists.

“Sir, you wouldn’t come to this committee and say something you can’t prove. I know you wouldn’t do that,” Thompson said, “but you did.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/1__2066.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-11 21:57:07.874509

This is not a question of red vs blue, the heartland vs the coastal cities, or MSNow vs FoxNews, It’s also not the exclusive purview of Washingtonians like myself. In fact, the trajectory of democracy and human rights globally matters to every American, regardless of one’s politics, faith, background, zipcode, or Spotify Wrapped playlist. And the warning signs are too abundant to ignore, such as the recently released U.S. National Security Strategy that deprioritizes human rights in U.S. diplomacy – except when it comes to our European allies – and embraces fringe Great Replacement white nationalist narratives on migration. We’ve seen longtime Allies questioning U.S. staying power that underpinned transatlantic security for the last 75 years; the spectacles earlier this year of the United States exiting the UN Human Rights Council and boycotting its own Universal Periodic Review; and the dismantlement of the U.S. Agency for International Development and decimation of the State Department bureaus responsible for human rights, refugee policy, and multilateral affairs, alongside elimination of the global women’s issues and global criminal justice offices and conflict stabilization bureau– all moves that dealt a debilitating blow to peace and security worldwide.

All this is happening as we approach the two-decade mark in a global democratic recession, per the dedicated experts at Freedom House, a storied, non-partisan organization whose life-saving support for human rights defenders under siege globally has been eviscerated by U.S. funding cuts. And make no mistake, the United States has joined the ranks of nations in democratic decline, according to respected, independent international observers like CIVICUS, as the rule of law, freedoms of expression and association, and separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution have been under near-daily assault since January 20.

So my question for all of us is, do we stand by, admire the problem, look the other way, or try and build a better, bipartisan alternative? As someone who devoted much of her adult life working to advance U.S. national security abroad – under 6 Presidents, Democrat and Republican – allow me to make the case for the latter. And at a moment when some question the cost-benefit or legitimacy of standing up for freedom abroad, I’d like to focus on three dimensions of U.S. human rights leadership where a renewed, bipartisan approach is crucial to anchoring American security, prosperity and well-being for years to come.

Number One: U.S. human rights leadership makes Americans safer by keeping authoritarians in check and rallying Allies and partners in common cause to push back. Ronald Reagan recognized this in his famous speech at Westminster in 1983 when he made the case for promoting an “infrastructure for democracy” overseas resulting in the creation of the National Endowment for Democracy, which has provided critical support to thousands of human rights champions around the world and earned strong bipartisan support since then.

In my most recent diplomatic role, traveling to over 60 countries, I saw first-hand the heavy toll of authoritarian overreach in every region of the world, alongside the promise of collective pushback. Take the devastating impact of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which generated Europe’s worst humanitarian and refugee crisis since World War II, upended global food and energy security from Africa to the Americas, and involved Russian abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to fates unknown. But the Kremlin’s aim of erasing Ukraine’s democracy overnight in 2022 was thwarted, thanks to the courage of the Ukrainian people and government and the determination of the U.S. and other partner nations to support them. Much of that crucial U.S. support for Ukrainian refugees, civil society, anti-corruption champions, and prosecutors of Russian war crimes was jeopardized by U.S. funding cuts this year, contravening bipartisan Congressional appropriations.

Adding insult to injury, the Trump Administration incorporated Russian positions on territorial concessions and NATO into its 28-point peace plan for Ukraine and won Kremlin plaudits for its just released National Security Strategy. Putin could not have asked for a better gift as he approaches the four-year mark of his further invasion, as the White House endorses Russian land grabs that he couldn’t secure by force, despite the steadfast help of his fellow autocrats in Tehran, Pyongyang, and Beijing.

Keeping autocrats in check is also a vital strategic aim of U.S. China policy, where bipartisan convergence made possible legislative breakthroughs like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and the Tibet Resolve Act, both aimed at holding the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to account for its brutal suppression of religious and ethnic minorities. I saw this bipartisan dynamic play out as a Commissioner of the Congressional Executive Commission for China (CECC) — a longtime platform for courageous human rights activists, scholars and journalists to call out CCP abuses inside and beyond China. But rather than bolster their efforts, the United States terminated USAID support that helped democratic Tibetan institutions grow and flourish in exile, eliminated the prospects of Chinese nationals fleeing religious or political persecution to obtain refugee protections here, and silenced the broadcasts of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia that delivered uncensored truth to hundreds of millions listeners in China and other closed societies for decades. It is striking that human rights are not mentioned once in the National Security Strategy’s section on China. Again, President Xi could not have asked for a better gift, particularly at a moment when the PRC is flexing its muscle to menace Taiwan – an issue that that same Strategy reduces to supply chains, ignoring the strategic import of Taiwan’s tremendous democratic trajectory.

This brings me to the second strategic dimension: U.S. human rights leadership makes Americans more prosperous by leveling the playing field for American workers, promoting rule of law which helps businesses protect innovation and resolve disputes peacefully, keeping kleptocrats and transnational criminals from stealing public resources or extorting American companies, and welcoming newcomers fleeing persecution who quite literally enrich our society. In other words, by prioritizing workers’ rights, rule of law, anti-corruption and transparency as core elements of U.S. foreign policy, bipartisan champions can help create greater opportunity for Americans at home, in addition to doing the right thing.

I’ve seen this win-win dynamic play out all over the world, from concerted U.S. government, NGO and private sector engagement that helped eliminate forced labor from the cotton sector in Uzbekistan, create new frameworks for garment worker safety in Bangladesh, and recover over $1billion in stolen assets in Malaysia. All of these anti-trafficking and anti-corruption efforts have been upended by the evisceration of U.S. foreign assistance in these areas and the decision to discontinue enforcement of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, despite a strong body of bipartisan legislative backing, from the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 to the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act of 2024.

The prosperity dividend also applies to U.S. efforts to welcome refugees, a multi-generational endeavor with a proud bipartisan and community-based tradition. My organization, Human Rights First, helped secure unanimous Senate adoption of U.S. Refugee Act of 1980— affirming the act of welcoming the oppressed as a quintessentially American value. Since then, we’ve learned of the immense contributions that millions of U.S.-based refugees have made to the communities that welcomed them. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study showed that from 2005 to 2019, refugees delivered net gains of over $123 billion to the U.S. economy, in the form of jobs created, businesses launched, and taxes paid. This is one more reason why — in addition to saving lives and upholding U.S. and international law — it’s critically important that the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and access to asylum protections, legal immigration pathways that have been virtually eliminated, be restarted without delay.

The third and final strategic dimension I’d like to highlight is how U.S. respect for human rights and their universality upholds American well-being, especially when it comes to leading by example and protecting the integrity of our democracy for future generations. I know successive U.S. administrations – including President Biden’s– have fallen short in upholding human rights abroad, especially when it comes to applying human rights universally with U.S. partners, from Israel to El Salvador to Saudi Arabia. But our current trajectory not only deprioritizes human rights in our diplomacy but externalizes escalating domestic human rights abuses – from unlawful transfers of migrants to arbitrary detention in third countries to extrajudicial killings in Pacific and Caribbean boat strikes. This is why our active civil society, our free and independent media, and our separate and empowered judicial and legislative branches are indispensable to hold policymakers accountable to uphold the law and do the right thing. It’s also why we must robustly push back on efforts to restrict civil society or dissent, under the false mantle of fighting domestic terrorism.

So faced with this existential crossroads for democracy and human rights, let’s reject the path of least resistance, fear, or apathy. Instead let’s work together to rebuild bipartisan consensus for keeping authoritarians in check, for smart foreign assistance investments that help hold autocrats, U.S. partners, and kleptocrats to account and keep human rights defenders and independent journalism afloat. Together, we should welcome refugees and other immigrants who enrich our communities and national prosperity. And together, we must defend the freedoms and rights enshrined in our Constitution – and reflected in the Universal Human Rights Declaration adopted 77 years ago today – that are the ultimate source of our national strength.

Mubashir was outside on his lunch break in Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis when he was arrested on Tuesday.
“I declined, because how will a picture prove I’m a US citizen?” he said.
Mubashir said the officers drove him to the ICE detention facility at Fort Snelling, a 17-minute drive from where he was arrested.
The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been a staunch advocate for the Somali community in his city, said the actions of the ICE agents were unconstitutional.","An American man was dragged out of a restaurant, forcibly arrested, and detained for two hours by masked federal immigration officers, according to reports.

The 20-year-old man, who gave MPR News only his first name, Mubashir, moved to the U.S. from Somalia as a child and later became a naturalized citizen.

Mubashir was outside on his lunch break in Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis when he was arrested on Tuesday.

While walking out on the street near 4th Street and Cedar Avenue, Mubashir said he noticed two masked men approach him, to avoid them he went into a nearby restaurant.

The two men followed him inside, dragged him outside, and arrested him. Mubashir was also pushed onto his knees in the snow and put into a chokehold, CBS Newsreported.

Mubashir began yelling, “I have my ID,” to the officers; however, the agents did not respond.

When he was put into the car, Mubashir was asked if the agents could take his picture.

“I declined, because how will a picture prove I’m a US citizen?” he said.

“I told him, ‘I have my passport, it’s in my phone. Can I open it and show you?’ He declined. I told him ‘can I give you my name and my date of birth?’ He declined.”

Due to Mubashir’s refusal to have his picture taken, he was in the car for almost an hour. The agents also tried to take his fingerprints; however, their machine was not working.

Mubashir said the officers drove him to the ICE detention facility at Fort Snelling, a 17-minute drive from where he was arrested. He claimed the officers were lost and did not know their surroundings.

“They kept going back on the same highway. I told them, ‘are you guys lost?; they said, ‘this is our first time taking someone in’. They had their maps out and everything and they were trying to intimidate me,” he said.

Once they arrived, the officers kept him outside until he agreed to have his face scanned; however, like the first machine, the second machine was not working, so he was brought inside.

At the facility, a staff member allowed him to turn on his phone to show his ID, which prompted them to release Mubashir as his parents arrived to pick him up.

The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been a staunch advocate for the Somali community in his city, said the actions of the ICE agents were unconstitutional.

“What we saw by these ICE agents that clearly did not know what they were doing was violence and unwillingness to hear the simple truth, which he was repeating again and again, which is, ‘I’m an American citizen’,” he said.

“[He was] taken into custody for now reason at all, in clear violation of law and the Constitution of the United State for simply walking down the streeting and looking like he’s Somali.”

President Donald Trump has been stoking tensions against the Somali immigration population, describing the community as “garbage” and saying he does not want them in the country.

Federal agents have also launched a crackdown against Minnesota Somalis, sparking criticism from leaders of the Somali community and democrats, including Frey and Governor Tim Walz.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has also branded Trump as a national embarrassment on X after his rant against immigrants and Somalis.

“He needs serious help,” she wrote. “Since he has no economic policies to tout, he’s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead.

“He continues to be a national embarrassment.”

About 84,000 of the 260,000 Somalis in the country live in the Minneapolis-St. In the Paul area, the overwhelming majority of them are U.S. citizens. Almost 58 per cent were born in the U.S., and 87 per cent of those born elsewhere are naturalized citizens.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/04/3/43/SEI274643746.jpg?trim=0,2,0,1&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-12-11 19:57:08.217120

Many of these actions have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts and carried out with little to no transparency, while thousands of peoples’ lives are uprooted from communities across the country, families separated, and their rights systematically violated.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced today U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have made more than 10,000 arrests of illegal aliens—including murderers, kidnappers, sexual predators, and armed carjackers—in Los Angeles, California since June 2025.

This success of this operation is in spite of violent rioters who assaulted our law enforcement, threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at them, and attempted to obstruct lawful arrests of criminal illegal aliens.

“In the face of violence from rioters and demonization by sanctuary politicians, DHS law enforcement has made over 10,000 arrests in Los Angeles since operations began in June. Some of the most heinous criminal illegal aliens arrested include murderers, kidnappers, sexual predators, and armed carjackers,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass failed the people of California. They let these criminals roam free. Thanks to our brave law enforcement, California is safer with these thugs off their streets. Instead of thanking our law enforcement for removing criminals from their communities, Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass repeatedly demonized our brave law enforcement during these operations.”

Since operations began in Los Angeles, DHS has arrested the worst of the worst including:

Alireza Hashemi, a criminal illegal alien from Iran, convicted of rape, aggravated assault, domestic violence, burglary, and driving under the influence.

Andres Velasquez-Ocampo, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico, convicted of armed carjacking, vehicle theft, and vandalism.

Years of unchecked data-trawling at borders, including the UK’s, have led us here,” said Javier Ruiz Diaz, the group’s technology and human rights lead.
The UK-based Free Speech Union, led by Toby Young, also declined to comment, saying it had a policy of not commenting on free speech issues in other countries.
Going back further than the five years of social media posts that would be checked, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, called Trump in 2017 an “odious, sad, little man”.
“Privacy isn’t just a technical issue; it’s about dignity and the freedom to be human.” X, TikTok and Meta, which operates Instagram, Facebook and Threads, were approached for comment.","Free speech advocates have accused Donald Trump of “shredding civil liberties” and “censorship pure and simple” after the White House said it planned to require visa applicants from dozens of countries to provide social media, phone and email histories for vetting before being allowed into the US.

In a move that some commentators compared to China and others warned would decimate tourism to the US, including the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the Department for Homeland Security said it was planning to apply the rules to visitors from 42 countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Germany and Japan, if they want to enter the US on the commonly used Esta visa waiver.

The checks will be carried out when a traveller applies for their Esta and “will require Esta applicants to provide their social media from the last five years” as well as “telephone numbers used in the last five years” and “email addresses used in the last 10 years”, government documents show.

“The seriousness of this move should not be downplayed,” said Jemimah Steinfeld, the chief executive of Index on Censorship in London. “Through a simple search any posts critical of Trump and his administration could be revealed and then what? Will admission to the USA be predicated on being nice about the president? That would be censorship pure and simple and the result will extend far beyond as people start to self-censor to keep the door to the USA open to them.”

Amnesty International UK called the plan “wildly out of proportion to any legitimate border need”.

“This moment shows how ‘slippery slopes’ on human rights suddenly become cliffs. Years of unchecked data-trawling at borders, including the UK’s, have led us here,” said Javier Ruiz Diaz, the group’s technology and human rights lead.

The Big Brother Watch campaign group called the plan “the latest evidence of the Trump administration’s enthusiasm for shredding civil liberties in the name of border control and national security”.

“The US government would each year have access to millions of years’ worth of social media content, the vast majority of which includes speech that is legal in the United States,” said Matthew Feeney, the group’s advocacy manager. “This would encourage millions of law-abiding people, including many American citizens, to self-censor criticism of the US government. So much for the Trump administration’s commitment to free speech.”

In Brussels, Trump’s move was described as “ironic” given his criticism of the EU’s €120m fine of Elon Musk’s X platform last week as “nasty”. The border measures were “a dramatic overreach and breach of fundamental rights,” said the German MEP Birgit Sippel, a member of the European Parliament’s committee on civil Liberties, justice and home affairs.

Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said the new entry requirements were “an outrageous demand that violates fundamental free speech and free expression rights”, according to Politico.

Trump said on Wednesday: “We want safety. We want security. We want to make sure we’re not letting the wrong people come into our country.”

Asked on Thursday how it would protect its employees from the checks, the European Commission described the policy as “floated plans”. “We haven’t seen any confirmation of this plan, so there’s no need for us to further speculate,” a spokesperson said.

The UK-based Free Speech Union, led by Toby Young, also declined to comment, saying it had a policy of not commenting on free speech issues in other countries.

The move sparked some darkly comic responses. The X account of the UK satirical news programme Have I Got News for You said: “The US border force is considering ‘social media checks’ for visitors before allowing them entry, which is fine because we’ve always said Trump’s ideas are great and he’s a good person.”

Seth Bannon, an investor from San Francisco, said: “This is insane. China is preparing to require tourists to hand over five years of social media history, all email addresses and phone numbers used in the last five years, and the freaking names and addresses of family members. No thanks won’t be visiting anytime soon!”

He followed up with a post saying: “Oh no whoops no that’s the US, not China.”

Jon Cooper, a former campaign chair for Barack Obama, said: “This is insane. It will DECIMATE the US tourism industry.” Paul Barry, an investigative journalist based in Australia, added: “Bang goes that US trip.”

Within the past five years, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, has posted on X that the Trump supporters who rioted at the Capitol in 2021 were part of “a direct attack on democracy and legislators carrying out the will of the American people”.

Going back further than the five years of social media posts that would be checked, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, called Trump in 2017 an “odious, sad, little man”. The same year, the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, who is holding meetings in Silicon Valley this week, accused Trump on X of “degrading [the] office of the president” over a tax bill that benefited the super-rich and said: “Trump & Putin don’t want ‘real’ news, they want silence”.

Jeremy Bradley, an expert in privacy and the managing director of Zama, a cryptography company based in Paris, said it was wrong to treat someone’s online history as a permanent record of their beliefs, because people’s views changed.

“Personal choice and freedom of expression shouldn’t be sacrificed in the name of surveillance, especially when it chills speech and curtails basic freedoms,” he said. “Privacy isn’t just a technical issue; it’s about dignity and the freedom to be human.”

Sophia is a native-born U.S. citizen, the daughter of immigrants who came to the U.S. during the Taliban's first period in power. But she said Milad is an Afghan immigrant on humanitarian parole since 2021, in the process of applying for a green card, which offers permanent U.S. residency.

The ICE agents refused to look at Milad's documentation, according to Sophia, who said they refused to let her go with them. They even balked at letting her and Milad's 3-year-old daughter kiss Milad goodbye, though they finally allowed it, she said.

""She finally hugged him and kissed him,"" Sophia Nyazi said, ""and then my husband’s eyes were red. We were all emotional. And then they covered his head, and they arrested him, put his handcuffs in front, and they took him away.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not commented when asked about immigration policy changes by the Trump administration and the reasons behind them.

But in a statement to Houston Public Media specifically about Milad Nyazi’s case, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “On December 2, 2025, ICE New York arrested Milad Nyazi, a 28-year-old criminal illegal alien from Afghanistan,” adding that he has two previous arrests for alleged domestic violence.

Sophia Nyazi said the arrests were the result of a misunderstanding and that all charges were dropped. An exhaustive search of multiple databases turned up no other criminal records. And Milad has not been charged in relation to the Washington shooting, nor is there any evidence he had any involvement in that case.

“Things are really bad for these folks”

Shawn VanDiver is president of AfghanEvac, an organization dedicated to helping Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war to resettle in the United States. He said, since the shooting in Washington, the Trump administration has shuttered almost all legal options for Afghan nationals to come to the United States.

""The only people that can get here right now are people who already had a visa in their passport. So, if you have a visa in your passport, you should get here as fast as you can,"" VanDiver said. ""Things are really bad for these folks.""

U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, had previously advocated strengthening and expanding the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program aimed at helping Afghans who had assisted the U.S. during the long war in their country to come to the U.S. and become citizens. But Cornyn, who is facing tough primary challenges from both Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Houston-area U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, recently defended the Trump administration's crackdown.

""This is just one example of the abuse of something called parole, which is supposed to be done on a case-by-case basis,"" Cornyn said, ""but which [former President] Joe Biden claimed to have the authority to deal categorically with tens of thousands of immigrants from other countries around the world and bring them to the United States, basically unvetted.""

Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said the claim that Lakanwal was unvetted, which members of the Trump administration have stated repeatedly, is untrue. Lakanwal underwent multiple background checks, first when he went to work with the CIA, then before he came to the U.S., then when he applied for asylum, Gelatt said.

""I think the challenge with vetting is that the U.S. government can vet what’s in someone’s background — who they associated with, whether they were involved in a terrorist organization, whether they have a criminal history — but the vetting can’t predict who is likely to commit a crime in the future, at least not in any kind of reliable way,"" Gelatt said.

Annie Pforzheimer, who previously served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, supported Gelatt's argument and said it's a mistake to blame the screening process.

""This was something people took really seriously,"" Pforzheimer said. ""So, vetting itself can’t fix everything. What you really need are support services for people who are here. That is something that apparently was lacking in this case.""

“They’re going to kill him, and I don’t want that happening”

Pforzheimer said she was worried about what the Trump administration’s policy change would mean, not only for the Afghan community in the U.S., but for the future of U.S. diplomacy and security.

“I owe my life as a diplomat who served in Kabul on two separate tours, to Afghan allies,” Pforzheimer said. “When we were there — with the military, with our embassy — we repeatedly made promises of friendship and alliance and collaboration, and as a country, if our word is meaningless, if our honor is meaningless, I am concerned about how we’re going to go forward in a complex world of international relations where your word means something, or has to mean something.”

According to the ICE Detainee Locator website, Milad Nyazi has been moved to the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico, more than 2,000 miles from his family’s home. His wife, Sophia, said she feels no one is helping them. She's still seeking an attorney to take Milad's case pro bono.

""I’m scared,” said. “If he gets shipped to Afghanistan, once the Taliban gets him, God knows what happens, because once they find out, they’re going to kill him, and I don’t want that happening.""",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10165739/The-Nyazis-2.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 19:56:46.555515

(AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from an immigration detention center in Pennsylvania following an order from a federal judge issued Thursday, according to his attorney’s office.

Abrego Garcia’s attorney confirmed he was released just before 5 p.m. Thursday and told The Associated Press he plans to return to Maryland, where he has an American wife and child and where he has lived for years after originally immigrating to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. Attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said he’s not sure what comes next, but he’s prepared to defend his client against further deportation efforts.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland earlier Thursday ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.

The ruling marked a major victory for the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.

He had been held at Moshannon Valley Processing Center about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.

“The government still has plenty of tools in their toolbox, plenty of tricks up their sleeve,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said, adding he fully expects the government to again take steps to deport his client. “We’re going to be there to fight to make sure there is a fair trial.”

The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the judge’s decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.

“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the judge made it clear that the government can’t detain someone indefinitely without legal authority and that his client “has endured more than anyone should ever have to.”

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.

A court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials’ affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.

“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.

Xinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.

Separately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.

He is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.

A judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case.

House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.).
also asked Noem to commit to providing more DHS officials to testify before the committee, which the secretary agreed to do.
Democrats also confronted Noem with videos and specific cases that they claim demonstrate the excesses of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy toward unauthorized immigration.","In the face of criticism from Democrats about alleged misconduct on the part of U.S. immigration officers, Noem also defended the conduct of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, arguing that Democrats were unfairly villainizing immigration officials and contributing to violence against them and their families.

The hearing, an annual occasion which sees Homeland Security secretaries and FBI and NCTC directors testify before congressional committees about the threats the country faces, came at a particularly precarious moment for Noem. While Trump reiterated confidence in Noem on Wednesday, Trump allies have floated the names of several potential replacements as frustrations have boiled over in recent months with how DHS has spent money intended to boost the government’s deportation efforts and how DHS has managed federal disaster relief money.

Democrats took advantage of the rare appearance by Noem on Capitol Hill to re-up allegations that Noem gave a $220 million contract to a firm tied to the spouse of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin and argue that immigration enforcement officers have violated the civil rights and due process of unauthorized immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.

Ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and other Democrats called on Noem to resign, arguing that her tenure has been marked by incompetence, corruption and other malfeasance.

Democrats also noted it was only Noem’s second appearance before the House committee and one of the few times a DHS official had testified before the committee, as they slammed DHS for a lack of transparency with Congress. Thompson claimed that it had been very difficult to secure DHS officials as witnesses for hearings.

“Never in the history of the committee has a secretary of Homeland Security hidden from congressional oversight like you and your department have, Secretary Noem,” Thompson said at the start of the hearing.

House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.). also asked Noem to commit to providing more DHS officials to testify before the committee, which the secretary agreed to do.

Noem received most of the questions from Democrats and Republicans at the hearing, which also included fellow witnesses Michael Glasheen, the operations director of the FBI’s national security branch, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent. The two faced more questions once Noem left the hearing early to helm a FEMA-related meeting.

In a potential sign that Republicans see Noem’s position as relatively secure, GOP lawmakers went soft on Noem, voicing general satisfaction with the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement and homeland security broadly.

“The border is secure, the flow of drugs is slowing, and violent criminals are being taken off the streets. America is once again a symbol of global strength,” Garbarino said.

“Please go back to your agencies and thank the men and women that are serving every day and helping to keep this country safe,” said Rep. Tony Gonzalez (R-Texas), who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.

But Republicans did push Noem to help them conduct oversight of the department’s work. New York lawmakers from both parties asked Noem to explain why DHS decided to cut counterterrorism grants to the Empire State. Trump reversed that decision following advocacy from New York lawmakers.

Democrats also confronted Noem with videos and specific cases that they claim demonstrate the excesses of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy toward unauthorized immigration.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.) pointed to a case where a Korean-born U.S. Marine who served in the U.S. invasion of Panama was deported to Korea earlier this year over drug possession charges from the 1990s. His staffer had the Marine join the hearing via Zoom and held up the livestream with the Marine over Magaziner’s shoulder while the Rhode Island Democrat questioned Noem.

“These people are not the worst of the worst,” Magaziner said. “You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys. Go after the terrorists. Do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”

Noem pledged to review the individual cases brought up by Magaziner and Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), but reiterated the Trump administration’s view that it cannot, and should not, make distinctions between the levels of criminal wrongdoing foreign nationals have committed.

“It is not my prerogative, my latitude, or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country and in which broad discretion of the secretary used to follow you can issue,” Noem said.

Democrats scoffed at that idea.

“You have broad discretion as the secretary,” Magaziner responded. “You can do all kinds of things. You’re choosing not to.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6b%2F4a%2F989950214e31a957ea1a2ed714f6%2Fu-s-congress-33702.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:59:55.736247

Abrego Garcia remains protected from being removed to El Salvador again, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had proposed deporting him to one of several African countries where he has no ties.

“Because Abrego Garcia has been held in ICE detention to effectuate third-country removal absent a lawful removal order, his requested relief is proper,” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in her 31-page opinion.

“Separately, Respondents’ conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer,” Xinis continued.

She ordered his release to take place “immediately” and demanded the government provide an update by 5 p.m. EST.

Though Xinis’s ruling paves the way for ICE to release Abrego Garcia, he remains subject to the pretrial release conditions imposed in his criminal human smuggling case.

Those include detention at his Maryland home with electronic monitoring, third-party custodianship and other measures to ensure he appears in court.

Still, Xinis’s ruling marks a major legal victory for Abrego Garcia, who has sought his release from immigration custody for months. Xinis is an appointee of former President Obama.

“This is naked judicial activism by an Obama appointed judge,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on the social platform X. “This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts.”

A Salvadoran national who entered the U.S. illegally nearly 15 years ago, Abrego Garcia garnered national attention after he was wrongfully deported in March to a megaprison in El Salvador despite an order protecting him from deportation to his native country over fears he would be the target of violence.

It became a flash point in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, a cornerstone of President Trump’s second-term agenda. The administration has accused Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, which he denies.

Abrego Garcia’s case quickly went to the Supreme Court and back, ultimately leading to his return to the United States in June as the Justice Department unsealed a human smuggling indictment against him in Tennessee. He pleaded not guilty.

After the judge in Tennessee permitted Abrego Garcia’s release pending trial, he returned to Maryland, where he had lived for more than a decade. He was quickly taken into immigration custody by ICE in August and has been detained ever since.

With the order protecting Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador still on the books, the Trump administration began proposing African countries to send him to.

At turns, officias provided him notice he would be removed to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana or Liberia, though they later said the Ghana notice was sent “prematurely.”

Abrego Garcia maintained he should be allowed to instead be removed to Costa Rica. The Trump administration insisted the country wasn’t agreeing to take him.

The judge found that to be untrue, writing in Thursday’s ruling that the Trump administration “affirmatively misled the tribunal” by suggesting otherwise.

“This evidently remained an inconvenient truth for Respondents,” Xinis wrote.

“But more to the point, Respondents’ persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” the judge continued.

Joining us to discuss the report's findings is Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA. Welcome to the program.

AMY FISCHER: Thank you for having me.

FADEL: So let's first talk about how you got to these findings. Did you have access to these detention facilities?

FISCHER: So ICE actually provided us access to the Krome facility, and while we were inside, we spoke to four individuals who were detained inside of Krome, who had also previously been detained at Alligator Alcatraz. And then, while we were in the area, we spoke with numerous lawyers and advocates and community members about the situation in Florida and inside both facilities.

FADEL: Specifically, what did you find at Krome, where you were actually able to see inside the facility, which is an actual ICE facility? Alligator Alcatraz is actually run by the state and not overseen by ICE.

FISCHER: Exactly. So at Krome, we heard from people inside that they are regularly denied medical care. They don't have adequate food. There is abuse by the guards. While we were actually inside, we were being allowed near the area where they have people in solitary confinement. And we were stopped by one of the individuals in solitary who said to us that he was on hunger strike. And when I bent down to speak to him through the food slot of his door, he was showing me his injured hand, how he had been denied medical care for well over 30 days. And in the midst of the conversation, an ICE agent actually slammed the metal flap on the injured hand of this individual and then repeatedly punched the door multiple times.

FADEL: And you requested access to Alligator Alcatraz. You did not receive a response. How did you get the findings you found about Alligator Alcatraz if you had no access?

FISCHER: We spoke with people that had been previously detained there. We also spoke with lawyers, with advocates and with family members who had loved ones detained inside. The descriptions of Alligator Alcatraz were truly harrowing. What we learned is that people there are detained in cages, over 30 people per cage, and only three toilets that oftentimes are broken and have sewage running into the sleeping areas. And most troubling, we heard about the use of something that is called the box, which was described to us as a 2-foot-by-2-foot cage-like structure in the open, and they are shackled at their hands and at their feet and chained to the ground in this cage in the sun for hours upon hours at a time, without access to food or water as a form of punishment.

FADEL: Did you take your findings to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE?

FISCHER: Yes. As part of all of Amnesty's reports, we send our findings to the respective agencies and provide them a right to reply. Neither the Department of Homeland Security, the government of Florida replied to those rights of reply.

FADEL: What recommendations are you making in your report about these two facilities?

FISCHER: Ultimately, these two facilities need to be shut down, and the people inside need to be released into their home communities. What we found at both facilities is that people are being detained arbitrarily. International law states that people should not be detained simply for immigration processing and should only be detained in the most extraordinary circumstances solely to provide identity or to mitigate flight risk.

FADEL: Amy Fischer is director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA, and one of the authors of this report on conditions in two Florida detention centers. Thank you so much for your time.

FISCHER: Thank you.

And Plake said, most of them have not been charged.

""Through our tracking,” she explained, “only 16 people out of the current 275 people currently detained as of today have a formal charge against them.”

The jail receives $100 a day from the federal government, per ICE inmate.

Plake and her group presented a petition to the Greene County Commission this month, asking the county and the Sheriff’s department to end the contract.

SMIA said detainment and detention policies have violated due process and human rights. Plake also said it's had economic impacts and affected communities where immigrants have put down deep and meaningful roots.

One of those communities is Troy, Missouri, where until earlier this year, Donna Hughes-Brown, lived with her husband, retired veteran Jim Brown. Hughes-Brown was born in England. She has lived in the US since she was 11 and has legal permanent resident status.

“Donna was detained,” Plake said, “after returning from a funeral in Ireland. And her life here in Missouri is one of deep roots, faith, family, caregiving and contribution.

Hughes-Brown was reportedly detained at O’Hare International Airport for two bad checks written in 2012 and 2015. Reporting indicates she received probation for the checks and paid back the sum, which was a combined $71. The black mark on her record was flagged as moral turpitude by ICE.

Hughes-Brown's case has made national headlines.

She will have a deportation hearing December 18. Ahead of that hearing, this Saturday, SMIA and partner organizations like Springfield Indivisible are organizing a vigil, in Springfield, Troy and Joplin. The event will recognize Hughes-Brown, but Plake said it is more than that too.

“The vigil is also going to serve to witness and acknowledge the pain of family separation, the disruption of lives, the inhumane conditions and honor impacted immigrants, their families and communities.” She said, adding, “we are also amplifying and also welcoming in to honor and recognize and witness the stories of those that we do not see amplified on a national scale.”

When it was his turn to grill Noem during a House hearing on global security threats, Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) asked, “How many United States military veterans have you deported?”

Noem answered, “Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans.”

“I don’t believe you served in the military. I haven’t either,” Magaziner continued. “But I think you and I can agree as Americans we owe everything to those who have served our military in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?”

As Noem answered in the affirmative, an aide appeared beside Magaziner with an iPad screen revealing the face of 55-year-old Sae Joon Park.

Magaziner cut off Noem’s answer, saying, “Madam Secretary we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park, a United States army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.”

Magaziner explained that the Purple Heart recipient struggled with PTSD and substance abuse, and was arrested in the 1990s for “some minor drug offenses” before getting clean and sober.

“Earlier this year you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn’t lived in since he was seven years old,” Magaziner said. “Will you join me in thanking Mr. Park for his service for our country?”

Noem’s answer was conditional.

MAGAZINER: And can you please tell Mr. Park why you deported him?

NOEM: — and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.

MAGAINER: But you understand many veterans struggle with PTSD, many veterans struggle with substance abuse challenges. This man took two bullets for our country. Will you — you have broad authority, by the way, as secretary, to issue humanitarian parole, to do deferred action — Will you commit to at least looking at Mr. Park’s case to see if you can help him find a pathway back to this country he sacrificed so much for?”

“I will absolutely look at his case, but —” Noem began as Magaziner interrupted to introduce two more veterans — present in the hearing room — whose relatives were deported.

Watch in our video player above.

Top military officials faced questioning over the deployments for the first time at the hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. They were pressed by Democrats over the legality of sending in troops, which in some places were done over the objections of mayors and governors, while Trump’s Republican allies offered a robust defense of the policy.

READ MORE: Shooting of National Guard members prompts flurry of U.S. immigration restrictions

It was the highest level of scrutiny, outside a courtroom, of Trump’s use of the National Guard in U.S. cities since the deployments began and came a day after the president faced another legal setback over efforts to send troops to support federal law enforcement, protect federal facilities and combat crime.

“In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the committee chairman. The deployments, he said, are “not only appropriate, but essential.”

Democrats argued they are illegal and contrary to historic prohibitions about the use of military force on U.S. soil.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., had pushed for the hearing, saying domestic deployments traditionally have involved responding to major floods and tornadoes, not assisting immigration agents who are detaining people in aggressive raids.

“Trump is forcing our military men and women to make a horrible choice: uphold their loyalty to the Constitution and protect peaceful protesters, or execute questionable orders from the president,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard.

Military leaders point to training

During questioning, military leaders highlighted the duties that National Guard units have carried out. Troops are trained in community policing, they said, and are prohibited from using force unless in self-defense.

Since the deployments began, only one civilian — in California — has been detained by National Guard personnel, according to Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of U.S. troops in North America. Guillot said the troops are trained to de-escalate tense interactions with people, but do not receive any specific training on mental health episodes.

“They can very quickly be trained to conduct any mission that we task of them,” Guillot said.

Republicans and Democrats see the deployments much differently

In one exchange, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted how former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations. She asked whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful.

Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the Defense Department, said he was unaware of Trump’s previous comments and that “orders to that effect would depend on the circumstances.”

“We have a president who doesn’t think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response.

Republicans countered that Trump was within his rights — and his duty — to send in the troops.

WATCH: National Guard is not Trump’s ‘private army,’ California AG Bonta

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana, a former Navy SEAL officer, argued during the hearing that transnational crimes present enough of a risk to national security to justify military action, including on U.S. soil.

Sheehy claimed there are foreign powers “actively attacking this country, using illegal immigration, using transnational crime, using drugs to do so.”

Senators also offered their sympathies after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington were shot just blocks from the White House in what the city’s mayor described as a targeted attack. Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died a day after the Nov. 26 shooting, and her funeral took place Tuesday. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe is hospitalized in Washington.

Hearing follows court setback for Trump

A federal judge in California on Wednesday ruled that the administration must stop deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control of the troops to the state.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer granted a preliminary injunction sought by California officials, but also put the decision on hold until Monday. The White House said it plans to appeal.

READ MORE: What is the Insurrection Act? Here’s what Trump has said about using it

Trump called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops in June without Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval to further the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.

The move was the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor and marked a significant escalation in the administration’s efforts to carry out its mass deportation policy. The troops were stationed outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles where protesters gathered and were later sent on the streets to protect immigration officers as they made arrests.

Trump also had announced National Guard members would be sent to Illinois, Oregon, Louisiana and Tennessee. Other judges have blocked or limited the deployment of troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, while Guard members have not yet been sent to New Orleans.

North Carolina sheriff keeps challenging top lawmaker who got Trump’s backing

President Trump has endorsed North Carolina’s longtime state Senate leader for reelection. But the announcement hasn’t been enough to get a sheriff challenging Phil Berger to abandon a March GOP primary for Berger’s Senate seat.

Trump praised both Berger and Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page on Truth Social late Wednesday but gave his backing to Berger, who’s the most powerful Republican in state government.

“Sam Page is GREAT, he has been a longtime supporter, but I really want him to come work for us in Washington, D.C., rather than further considering a run against Phil,” Trump wrote.

Page said on X that while he appreciates Trump’s kind words, he’ll keep running. Page says he’s “committed to upholding conservative values” and in part ending “liberal policies” Berger has pushed.

Berger’s hands have been on scores of right-leaning policies in state government since 2011. But he’s received some opposition, in part, for backing a potential casino. The bill permitting the casino fizzled.

Berger said he’s very grateful to have Trump’s support “as we pursue more conservative victories.”

White House won’t rule out future seizures of oil tankers

Asked if the seizure of a Venezuelan tanker was a one-off or if the U.S. might take similar actions in the future, Leavitt said she wouldn’t broadcast future military plans.

But she added, “We’re not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narcoterrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world.”

The White House has maintained that the tanker seized was carrying oil set to be sold in violation of international sanctions.

Leavitt added that the Trump administration is “executing on the president’s sanctions policies” and defending the sanctions policies of the U.S.

White House says tariffs means children’s dolls might cost ‘a dollar or two more’

Leavitt said the president was trying to defend his tariffs when he said at a rally Tuesday that Americans should buy fewer dolls and pencils for their children.

Trump was saying his tariffs are bringing back factory jobs and products made domestically might cost more, Leavitt said.

“Maybe you’ll pay a dollar or two more, but you will get better quality and you’ll be supporting your fellow Americans by buying American,” Leavitt said. “And that’s what the president was saying.”

The answer reflected some of the challenges that the administration faces on the import taxes imposed by Trump, which most economists say have added to inflationary pressures.

The White House has previously maintained that foreign countries would pay the taxes and that there would be little to no inflation domestically.

White House: Trump ‘extremely frustrated’ with lack of Ukraine peace progress

Leavitt said discussions continue and the U.S. could send a representative to those discussions as soon as this weekend “if there is a real chance of signing a peace agreement.”

But she added that it’s “still up in the air whether real peace can be achieved.”

Trump took office in January suggesting he could solve Russia’s war in Ukraine quickly but has spent months complaining bitterly about a lack of progress. Leavitt said the president is “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war.”

“And he’s sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting,” Leavitt said. “He doesn’t want any more talk. He wants action.”

Trump administration plans to ‘seize’ oil from tanker taken off Venezuelan coast

Leavitt says the U.S. government “does intend to seize the oil” from a tanker that U.S. forces took Wednesday off the coast of Venezuela.

Leavitt said the Justice Department had received a warrant to take the tanker because it’s a sanctioned vessel used to carry “black market” oil.

She said the U.S. has an investigative team on the tanker. The team is interviewing the people aboard the ship and collecting any relevant evidence.

Leavitt said the U.S. government will follow the legal process required to seize the available oil.

White House press secretary says Trump ‘prepared to take action on health care costs’

Karoline Leavitt was asked about the looming expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies after the Senate’s rejection of legislation that would have extended the tax credits.

The briefing came just after the chamber rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts.

Also blaming Democrats for the Obama-era health care bill, which she noted was passed “without a single Republican vote,” Leavitt argued that Democrats had “ballooned” the program “with these expensive COVID subsidies that completely distorted the health insurance market.”

Senate rejects legislation to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits

The rejection essentially guarantees that millions of Americans will see a steep rise in costs at the beginning of the year.

Senators rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts Thursday.

It’s an unceremonious end to a monthslong effort by Democrats to prevent the COVID-19-era subsidies from expiring on Jan. 1.

Ahead of the votes, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans that if they did not vote to extend the tax credits, “there won’t be another chance to act,” before premiums rise for many people.

Republicans have argued that Affordable Care Act plans are too expensive and need to be overhauled.

FEMA Review Council meeting abruptly canceled, AP source says

A presidentially appointed council’s long-awaited public meeting to announce recommended reforms to the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been canceled at the last minute, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the change publicly.

The FEMA Review Council was scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon. Noem, the council’s co-chair, abruptly left a congressional hearing early because she said she needed to go the meeting.

Trump created the FEMA Review Council by executive order in late January, the same day he proposed eliminating FEMA. He has repeatedly said he wants to push more responsibility for disaster recovery to states.

The White House, Department of Homeland Security and FEMA did not respond to questions about the meeting’s cancellation.

Democrats accuse Noem of lying

Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, accused Noem’s department of waging an “unaccountable, unlawful, unconstitutional” war against communities across the country.

Ramirez showed a number of videos of Noem talking and then repeatedly accused her of lying.

“Secretary Noem, you lie and you lie to the American people,” Ramirez said.

In one video, Noem said the agency focused on people in the country illegally, not American citizens while in another Noem said they were focusing on the “worst of the worst.”

Ramirez disputed those characterizations and said Noem lied with “impunity.”

Senate rejects GOP bill to create health savings accounts

The Senate has rejected a Republican bill to replace expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies with new health savings accounts. The legislation was a Republican alternative to Democratic legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

Senators are now voting on the Democratic bill and are expected to reject it — meaning that the subsidies are likely to expire.

Noem defends FEMA cuts to mitigation funding

Noem defended the cancellation of billions of dollars in mitigation grants administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying the grants had been “weaponized to fund the Green New Deal and for climate change.”

The Trump administration in April canceled $3.6 billion in grants under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, created under the first Trump administration to help communities harden infrastructure to mitigate damage from climate disasters.

Noem said FEMA is “deploying resources two times faster on average, than in history,” though a policy that she personally approve DHS expenditures of $100,000 or more has been widely criticized for slowing deployment of FEMA services and dollars.

Noem leaves hearing early to go to FEMA review council

Secretary Noem has left the hearing early.

Noem said she had to go to another meeting of a council that is offering suggestions on how to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

As she walked out, Julie Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who was slated to question the secretary next, joked: “I’m just going to take the position that she was scared of my questions.”

As Noem walked out of the room, protesters trailed her down the hallway yelling “Shame on you!”

Senate National Guard hearing concludes with Democrat pressing for commitments on troop deployments

But Trump administration officials declined to make commitments on what authorities the president may use in the future to send National Guard troops from one state to another.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, used the closing moments of the hearing to press the officials on whether National Guard troops will be deployed from other states beyond their current authority to protect federal facilities and officials, such as to conduct law enforcement activity.

Federal judges have blocked or limited troop deployments in Oregon, Illinois and California as the Trump administration has attempted to use troops to assist in its mass deportation goals.

Mark Ditlevson, a Trump administration official who oversees homeland defense, only said that any orders would be evaluated to make sure they are “100% legal.”

Putin and Maduro speak by phone amid US pressure

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed solidarity with Maduro and told him “direct communication channels” between the countries “remain permanently open,” a Venezuelan government statement said.

Talking a day after the U.S. military seized an oil tanker off the Venezuela’s coast, Putin told Maduro that “Russia will continue to support Venezuela in its struggle to assert its sovereignty, international law, and peace throughout Latin America, making its diplomatic capabilities available to strengthen cooperation in these essential areas,” the Venezuelan government said.

The Kremlin said both leaders also discussed developing friendly bilateral ties and their commitment to joint projects in trade, economic, energy, financial, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas.

Senate voting on first of two partisan health care bills

The Senate is voting on Republican legislation that would create new health savings accounts as health care subsidies for millions of Americans are set to expire Jan. 1.

The Senate is expected to reject the legislation, along with a second Democratic bill that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Republicans say the savings accounts would replace the subsidies by giving money directly to consumers, instead of to insurance companies. Democrats say the GOP plan would lead to higher costs for consumers.

Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that premiums will skyrocket unless Congress passes an extension of the subsidies. “If Republicans don’t climb aboard, there won’t be another chance to act,” Schumer said ahead of the votes.

Noem says Venezuela tanker seizure part of administration’s anti-drug campaign

Noem linked the seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast to the Trump administration’s efforts to push back on “a regime that is systematically ... flooding our country with deadly drugs.” She said Trump administration officials had seized “enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.”

On Wednesday, Trump said the United States had seized the tanker as tensions mount with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Trump has broadly justified a regional military buildup and a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean as necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.

Democrats question Noem about deportations

House Democratic identified members of the audience they said had family members who had been improperly treated by the immigration system.

Noem said she would review the cases of several called out by Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. One, a combat veteran, appeared on a screen via a video call. Magaziner said the Purple Heart recipient had been deported earlier this year.

“You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys,” Magaziner said to Noem.

Noem interrupts lawmaker during questions over National Guard shooting

The hearing quickly became heated over the tragic shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

Thompson had begun questioning Noem over what he called the “unfortunate accident” when the secretary interrupted the ranking Democrat.

“Unfortunate accident?” Noem retorted. She called it a “terrorist attack.”

The interaction devolved from there as Thompson questioned her department’s approval of asylum claim that allowed the suspect to stay in the U.S.

Noem insisted it was the Biden administration’s vetting process that failed to properly screen the man who had worked alongside the U.S. military in Afghanistan.

Pentagon attorney: legality of shooting protesters would ‘depend on the circumstances’’

An attorney for the Pentagon declined to offer a clear answer when asked if a president could lawfully order the military to shoot protesters.

During a hearing Thursday on National Guard deployments in U.S. cities, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations.

Hirono asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the defense department, whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful.

Young said he was unaware of Trump’s comments and responded that the answer “would depend on the circumstances.”

“We have a president who doesn’t think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response.

Judge orders Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be immediately released from immigration detention

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.”

The Salvadoran national has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Noem calls National Guard shooting suspect a ‘terrorist’

The secretary also levied broad criticism of the program that brought the man to the United States years before he allegedly shot two National Guard members.

Operation Allies Welcome was created by the Biden administration to save Afghan supporters from Taliban retribution after the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars of aid.

Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the Washington shooting. Noem said Thursday that U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, has been showing improvement.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He pleaded not guilty.

Senators question military leaders on evaluating the lawfulness of orders

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, questioned Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, on how he evaluates the lawfulness of orders.

Guillot said that he consults with military attorneys, raises any questions with the defense secretary and commanding military officers, and executes the order once he’s confident in its lawfulness.

This has become a pressing question under the Trump administration amid National Guard deployments to U.S. cities and a campaign to strike boats allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela. The president has targeted Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence officers to refuse illegal orders.

Protesters interrupt Noem’s remarks at House hearing

“End deportations!” shouts one. “Stop ICE raids!” yells another.

The two people were escorted by Capitol Police out of the Homeland Security Committee hearing room.

Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., gaveled the panel back to order as Noem resumed her opening remarks.

Top Democrat calls on Noem to resign

Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told the secretary she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump’s “extreme” immigration agenda, and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress.

“I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. “Do a real service to the country.”

Noem hearing before Homeland Security panel getting underway

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration’s hard-line approach to immigration.

Since Noem last appeared in Congress in May, immigration enforcement operations in U.S. cities have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department’s tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. Thursday’s appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

Democrat says most Americans don’t want Guard members in cities

Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said Trump’s deployment of the National Guard into American cities is “deeply unpopular.”

“Most Americans don’t want this,” she said at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, adding that most of the Guard members don’t want these assignments, either.

“Our heroes did not sign up for this,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard.

She noted that she had threatened to hold up the annual defense bill if Republican leadership continued to block the hearing, which she said is long overdue. She said she has questions for the military about how Trump’s deployments are affecting readiness, training and costs.

Senate hearing on National Guard deployment begins

The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is opening a hearing on Trump’s National Guard troop deployment to U.S. cities by asserting that crime is on the rise.

“In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.

He added that the troop deployments are “not only appropriate, but essential.”

Democrats are expected to use the hearing to criticize the deployments as an inappropriate use of military troops.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/9ecc83ad-dcd4-43a1-9180-311288814c6d/20251211T130505/9ecc83ad-dcd4-43a1-9180-311288814c6d.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:57:32.583147

We are in the best position in decades to achieve comprehensive immigration reform.","With the border secure, the time is ripe for comprehensive immigration reform for the first time in forty years. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops offers our legislators an outline of a balanced path forward, protecting our nation and its citizens while respecting the dignity of each human person.

Today’s immigration debates tend toward a simplistic binary: standing with immigrants—including the undocumented—or supporting law enforcement efforts to remove noncitizens with no legal status. The U.S. bishops take a more nuanced stance in their Special Message, affirming the duty of a nation to control immigration while recognizing the human cost of “indiscriminate mass deportation,” which ensnares noncitizens brought here as children, those married to U.S. citizens, and those who have developed significant ties to the country.

The bishops apply two bedrock principles of Catholic social teaching: solidarity and subsidiarity. Solidarity recognizes that each of us, created in the image and likeness of God, possesses inherent dignity. Even those illegally in the United States have a claim to dignity and respect. Indiscriminate mass deportation violates the principle of solidarity because it treats the undocumented as a monolithic whole without distinguishing individual claims for remaining within our political community. Subsidiarity recognizes that human beings flourish in community, including the political community.

Deeply influenced by natural law, legal scholars applied these principles as nation-states emerged centuries ago. Every human being, they said, has a right to emigrate—leave his or her country—if the conditions for human flourishing are absent in his or her homeland. And, every country has a qualified right to control its borders, including excluding potential immigrants. Countries, however, have a duty to accept some immigrants if they can be incorporated into the economic and social fabric of the nation without undue hardship on its citizens.

These principles apply Catholic teaching on the universal destination of goods. Gifted by the Creator, the goods of the world are for the benefit of all. The common good, however, is achieved in the particular. Parents, for example, contribute to the common good by feeding, forming, and educating their children. Justice requires, however, that they share their surplus in some fashion with the broader community.

The same applies to the nation-state. The United States contributes to the common good of the world by creating an environment where its citizens can flourish. Our excess, in justice not charity, should be shared with others in need through foreign aid or by providing immigration opportunities. What is needed for the nation to flourish and what is surplus is a matter of prudential judgment on which reasonable people can disagree.

Forty-four years ago, University of Notre Dame president Rev. Theodore Hesburgh chaired the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, which led to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Sympathizing with “the plight of illegal aliens,” Hesburgh also considered the cost to “Americans whose wages and standards are depressed by their presence”; the undocumented themselves who often risk life to enter illegally only to face exploitation by employers; and those noncitizens “waiting patiently in line” for years to enter the United States legally.

Democrats and Republicans alike sought to “close the back door on illegal immigration so that the front door on legal immigration may remain open.” Congress attempted to close the back door with sanctions for employers who hired undocumented labor. It also reformed legal immigration and provided a path to citizenship for most of the 4.5 million undocumented immigrants then residing within our borders.

The attempt to close the back door was a spectacular failure, and we are dealing with the fallout four decades later. By the early 2000s there were 12 million undocumented immigrants residing in the country. When President George W. Bush attempted in 2007 to push through comprehensive immigration reform, including another amnesty, House Republicans balked. Their mantra: Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. They lacked faith that future presidents would vigorously enforce our immigration laws. This stalemate has persisted for nearly twenty years.

In 2021, the floodgates opened with the president abusing his power to parole people into the United States, allowing millions in, knowing that only a small percentage had legitimate asylum claims. Pew Research estimated that a record 3.5 million unauthorized aliens entered between 2021 and 2023, with the number continuing to rise at record rates throughout the first half of 2024.

The pendulum swung strongly in 2025 with the new administration aggressively targeting criminal aliens, encouraging the undocumented to self-deport and sweeping up even those trying to quietly build lives in the United States, instilling fear throughout the undocumented population. This is an unfortunate but natural backlash to the failure to keep the promise made by both parties four decades ago to shut the back door of illegal immigration.

Yet herein lies hope. In 2007, House Republicans told the president to secure the border before considering some form of relief for the millions here in undocumented status. The border is now effectively secure.

For the common good, the Trump administration should continue to deport criminal aliens. It should also work with Congress to develop legislation that adopts a comprehensive, three-pronged reform plan to fix our broken immigration system.

First, the back door must remain shut. The bill should impose heavy penalties on employers who hire undocumented employees, with employees facing a potential lifetime ban from the United States for accepting such employment. The executive branch’s discretion to skirt Congressional intent by granting parole or Temporary Protected Status to millions must be reined in by this bill. The United Nations estimates that over 139 million people in the world are displaced or stateless. Civil war, famine, natural disasters, and terror give each of these people a right to emigrate. Our response to their plight shouldn’t be left to the president alone. Together, our political branches should make prudential judgments on how many of the world’s “masses yearning to breathe free” the United States can absorb.

Second, the United States should calibrate our guest worker program to the ebb and flow of the economy. While protecting the American workforce, the United States ought to have a healthy front door to meet the market demand for labor in the United States.

Third, with the border now secure, we can turn our attention to the millions of unauthorized immigrants residing among us. Some own businesses, employing citizens and noncitizens alike. Others are hardworking individuals simply seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Some were brought here as children by their parents. Others have married citizens. Many have developed strong community ties. Congress ought to provide a path to legalization of status for many of these immigrants.

We must keep the back door of illegal immigration closed. The common good of the United States depends on it. There will be no do-overs. If we grant legal status to some portion of those currently here illegally but fail to secure the border, we will never see another amnesty, and the current efforts at deportation will seem like child’s play when the next backlash inevitably comes.

We are in the best position in decades to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. We must seize the opportunity, creating a more secure and prosperous nation for future generations.

In recent days, EU countries have agreed on three controversial laws aiming at speeding up asylum procedures and increasing returns, while the European Commission has announced a new sanctions regime against people-smugglers.

These moves reflect the bolder stance the EU has taken on the issue in recent years, including by breaking taboos and aligning its policies with stances once taken only by far-right parties.

""Bankrupt smugglers’ business""

On Wednesday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that Europe is developing a stringent new sanctions regime in coordination with G7 partners.

“Our goal is simple. We want to bankrupt their businesses through all means available,” she said. “We want to be able to freeze the smugglers’ assets – to destroy their very financial base. But also to issue travel bans, so that we can restrict their movements.""

She made the announcement in her opening statement at the International Conference of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling in Brussels, which was attended by more than 80 delegations, including EU members and several non-EU states.

Von der Leyen's statement follows a commitment already stated during her State of the Union speech three months ago, when she outlined a new system of sanctions specifically targeted at smugglers and traffickers.

According to EU sources, the Commission will come up with concrete proposals on the sanctions regime, though the timing is not yet clear. Currently, it is consulting EU member states before putting forward any new measures.

“The Commission took forward the work on establishing a new sanctions regime against smugglers and traffickers to freeze their assets, restrict their freedom of movement and deprive them of their profits,"" reads the press release.

Also on Wednesday, more than 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration based on three main pillars: preventing migrant smuggling by strengthening national frameworks and exchanging information among states, developing alternatives to illegal migration, and stepping up financial investigations to trace, seize, and confiscate smuggling proceeds.

""If we want to stop smugglers, we need to work together at a global level"", EU Commissioner for Migration Magnus Brunner told Euronews.

A crackdown on irregular migrants' chances to stay in the EU

In parallel, the EU is pursuing a clear strategy to make it harder for irregular migrants to reach European territory and easier to be deported far away.

On Monday, the EU Council agreed on three major legislative changes that have to be negotiated with the European Parliament before final approval.

One of these is the return regulation, which, among other provisions, would allow EU member states to build “return hubs” in third non-EU countries where they could send asylum seekers they have rejected.

“Return hubs” could also be used as “transit hubs” to accommodate migrant people before they are actually returned to their countries of origin, something that Italy is already doing with two centres built in Albania. But they could also represent a ""final destination"" if the third country accepts non-nationals and respects human rights standards.

This would help EU states to speed up returns, but it could also put migrant people at risk, since they would be sent to countries with which they have no connection.

Even asylum seekers could end up in completely unrelated countries under another law approved on Monday.

“The incentive to pay a human smuggler [to reach Europe] will diminish, if you know that as soon as you arrive, you will be returned to a centre in a third country"", Rasmus Stoklund, Danish Minister for Immigration, who led the negotiations on the files, told Euronews.

Places of safety

A change in the concept of “safe third country” would expand the circumstances under which an asylum application can be rejected as inadmissible, enabling EU states to deport asylum seekers to third countries with which they have no link – provided that those countries have an agreement with an EU state and that respect human rights.

This framework would allow EU governments to implement schemes similar to the UK's scrapped Rwanda deportation policy, which was ruled unlawful by the British Supreme Court.

The third law agreed by member states would create a list of “safe countries of origin” for the purposes of asylum, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco, and Tunisia, plus all the current candidate countries for EU membership except for Ukraine.

Nationals of these countries would still have the right to apply for asylum in EU member states, but their applications would be assessed via fast-track procedures.

These new measures have drawn criticism from leftist groups in the European Parliament and civil society.

""In 2018, the European Commission itself said that ideas such as return hubs or setting up offshore deportation centres far from Europe would put people at risk of refoulement, torture or arbitrary detention,"" Olivia Sundberg Diez, EU Advocate on Migration and Asylum for Amnesty International, told Euronews.

""I don't understand why the Commission now thinks that these ideas can comply with EU law and human rights standards""",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/86/24/1200x675_cmsv2_2b6256f0-dfb6-5b0b-9c3d-9277b71358c5-9578624.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:58:16.264000

Newsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email outside office hours.

Why It Matters

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced the start of ""Operation Metro Surge,"" a federal immigration enforcement initiative in the Twin Cities that has involved increased activity by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul.

The operation has included arrests of individuals suspected of living in the country unlawfully, with federal officials saying the effort is focused on people with outstanding removal orders and criminal convictions.

The enforcement action coincided with recent remarks by President Donald Trump criticizing Somali immigrants in Minnesota. The president said he did not want Somali immigrants in the United States, sparking backlash from locals.

What To Know

City leaders, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O’Hara, said they were seeking additional information about the circumstances of the detention. They described the incident as concerning and emphasized that Minneapolis police were not involved in the federal operation.

Mubashir continued that he had asked agents if he could be dropped off back where he was picked up, to which they reportedly responded 'no, you have to walk in the snow'.

The administration has ordered a review of green card holders from Somalia and several other countries to determine whether they remain eligible to live in the United States.

The president has also ended the Temporary Protected Status for Somali nationals in Minnesota, a designation that had allowed a limited number of people from Somalia to live and work in the country because conditions there were considered unsafe for return.

Minnesota Governor Walz, in a letter to delivered on Wednesday to the DHS, revealed his concerns about the ongoing federal immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, citing reports that ""indicate that some citizens were documenting federal activity, while others were going about their daily lives"". Walz appeared to be referring to Susan Tincher, a 'citizen observer' during ICE arrests who was taken into custody.

Federal agents deployed pepper spray to disperse a crowd that was blocking their vehicles while they were conducting identification checks in a predominantly Somali neighborhood of Minneapolis on Tuesday.

What People Are Saying

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference: ""Taken into custody for no reason at all, in clear violation of law and the Constitution of the United States for simply walking down the street and looking like he's Somali.""

President Donald Trump said at a cabinet meeting on December 2: ""You know, our country's at a tipping point. We could go bad. We're at a tipping point. I don't know if people mind me saying that, but I'm saying it. We could go one way or the other, and we're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.""

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter told Newsweek: ""The Trump Administration’s threat to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents is a racially and politically motivated attack on our immigrant neighbors.

""By specifically targeting Somali families in Minnesota—home to the nation’s largest Somali community—the administration endangers lives and destabilizes entire neighborhoods.

""This action continues a pattern of harm we have come to expect from policies driven by division and discrimination. We stand with our Somali and East African neighbors in St. Paul and reject this retaliatory, fear-driven approach to governing.""

What Happens Next

Enforcement operations in the Twin Cities are expected to continue, with ICE officials stating that the focus remains on individuals with outstanding removal orders and criminal convictions.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the immediate release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was detained earlier this year and mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States in June but was arrested again on federal charges of human smuggling in Tennessee.

Xinis’ order, filed on Thursday, Dec. 11, is the latest twist in a case that has been shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. It is unlikely to be the last word on the matter, however. The Justice Department will likely appeal the ruling.

Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2012, had been living with his wife and three children in Beltsville, Maryland, when he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents near his home in March.

He was among hundreds of alleged members of crime gangs MS-13 and Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, whom the government expelled to El Salvador on March 15. Abrego Garcia was deported even though an earlier order had prevented him from being returned to his home country.

The Justice Department blamed his deportation on an administrative error but insisted he was a member of the MS-13 gang, which he has denied.

In her order, Xinis said it is “troubling” that the Justice Department continued to hold Abrego Garcia in custody for months on the grounds that it was going to expel him to another country – without taking any steps to actually remove him from the United States.

Xinis said the government had no authority to send him to a third country without a legal removal order, which she said it did not have.

At a hearing last month, Xinis wrote, Justice Department lawyers informed the court that they had no alterative but to send Abrego Garcia to the African country of Liberia because Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to hold him there.

But Costa Rica never rescinded its offer, Xinis writing, citing news reports.

“This evidently remained an inconvenient truth” for the administration, she wrote, saying the government’s lawyers had “affirmatively misled” the court.

More to the point, she said, the government’s refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option and its “misrepresentation” that Libera was the only country that would take him “all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal.”

Because of the absence of a legal removal order and because the government’s conduct over the past few months raises questions about its reasons for holding him, Abrego Garcia should be held no longer, Xinis said.

Even if he is released, Abrego Garcia still faces the criminal charges in Tennessee.

A federal grand jury in Nashville indicted him on May 21 on human smuggling charges. The indictment alleges that, from 2016 through 2025, he and other unnamed people conspired to bring undocumented migrants into the United States from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador and elsewhere.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Why it matters: Abrego Garcia's case has rallied immigrant rights groups and became an emblem of President Trump's far-reaching immigration crackdown.

What they're saying: ""Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,"" U.S. Judge Paula Xinis wrote in her 31-page ruling.

""For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia's Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.""

Abrego Garcia's attorney declined to comment for this story.

The other side: ""This is naked judicial activism by an Obama appointed judge,"" DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin told Axios in an emailed statement.

""This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed DHS' intentions of appealing Xinis' ruling on Thursday, adding that America has ""unfortunately"" seen ""activist judges"" in ""many cases across the country.""

She also repeated the administration's position that Abrego Garcia is a gang member, which his attorney denies.

Context: An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be sent back to his home country of El Salvador for fear of persecution, but did not explicitly order him to be removed to a specific country.

Without a specific named destination for Abrego Garcia, the court ruled that he's being detained without a lawful final order of removal.

Zoom in: The Thursday ruling also found that the Trump administration was not making a consistent effort to remove Abrego Garcia in a timely manner.

Abrego Garcia has said his preferred destination is Costa Rica, but the Trump administration instead pushed to send him to African countries where the Salvadorian has no ties, including Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana.

Those governments declined to accept him, prolonging his stay in ICE custody despite the Costa Rican government's willingness to receive him.

The bottom line: Xinis wrote that between the administration's ""threats"" to send Abrego Garcia to African countries and its ""persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option,"" it is clear that ""whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the 'basic purpose' of timely third-country removal.""

The White House did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

""The power of Christ compels you,"" the man shrieked as he was escorted out by Capitol Police.

Another protester yelled at Noem to ""stop terrorizing our communities."" He was also led out of the hearing room by police.

President Trump boasted Thursday that the US stock market just hit a record high on his watch, even as recent surveys show Americans are concerned about the direction of the economy.

""STOCK MARKET JUST HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH!!! When will the Fake Polls show that I am doing a great job on the Economy, and much more??? Thank you!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed Thursday that he had ""constructive"" talks on security guarantees for Kyiv to help wind down its more than three-year war with Russia.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and US presidential envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner joined the discussion.

Zelensky said the document on the guarantees would be released ""in the near future.""

""Security guarantees are among the most critical elements for all subsequent steps. We have already got the negative experience of the Budapest Memorandum,"" he added.

""Everyone remembers this, as well as the occasions when Russia repeatedly violated all its other commitments. That is why it is essential that this document on security guarantees provides concrete answers to what concerns Ukrainians the most: what actions partners will take if Russia decides to launch its aggression again.""

Protesters on Capitol Hill forced a congressional hearing featuring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to pause again Thursday afternoon.

Anti-ICE rabble-rousers were yelling and screaming outside the congressional hearing, briefly pausing the action as security officials closed the doors.

""How dare you!"" and ""Shame on you!"" were heard among the yells as Noem exited the hearing.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shared new details about the oil tanker that was seized off the coast of Venezuela Wednesday.

""The operation that was conducted yesterday morning was a Coast Guard-led operation. It was in partnership with the Department of War and the Department of Justice. The FBI as well,"" Noem divulged in a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday.

""And it was a successful operation directed by the president to ensure that we're pushing back on a regime that is systematically covering and flooding our country with deadly drugs and killing our next generation of Americans,"" she went on.

The DHS boss said that since President Trump entered office in January, there have ""been enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.""

""That's two-thirds of our country that has been saved by blowing up, by going after and bringing to justice these individuals that are out at sea and those individuals that are funding it with a shadow fleet of sanctioned oil that should never be sold to benefit their profits and their pockets to kill Americans,"" Noem said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem agreed to review a handful of cases involving US military veterans or their family members who were deported after having committed non-violent crimes, sometimes more than a decade ago.

""Madam Secretary, you promised America that you would go after the worst of the worst. But these people are not the worst of the worst: a Purple Heart recipient, a military spouse, the father of three Marines,"" said Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI).

The Purple Heart recipient was arrested for ""minor drug offenses in the 1990s,"" Magazine had noted earlier, while the military spouse ""did not come here illegally and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80.10 years ago.""

Noem agreed to look at the case of Sae Joon Park, the US combat vet who was deported to South Korea, but told Magaziner it wasn't her job ""to pick and choose which laws"" to enforce.

Magaziner fired back: ""The biggest problem is this: You don't seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists. Do not go after veterans, Marines, children.""

As many as 18,000 terrorists entered the US during the Biden administration, according to National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent.

""There's 18,000 known and suspected terrorists in the country right now that came in under Joe Biden's watch,"" Kent told Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday.

""It's unbelievable,"" Pfluger responded.

""And that's just what we know of,"" added Kent.

Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California used his five minutes during the Homeland Security panel's hearing to list instances in which non-citizens without criminal records have been apprehended by ICE agents — without taking any questions from Noem.

At one point, Correa played a video of an interview Democratic reps held with some family members of those swept up in the immigration enforcement operations.

""Why did you vote for him [Trump]?"" a Dem rep asked Jim Brown, the husband of Donna Hughes Brown.

""Because I was an idiot. Eighty percent of the evangelical Christian people were lied to,"" responded Brown on the video that was played in the hearing.

""They said criminal, you know, and I believe criminals need to be off the street,"" he added. ""My wife and I, when we don't work, we're ministers. We help the needy. That's what we do. ... And that's who they're arresting.""

Correa is incorrect that Hughes Brown had no criminal record. She had written bad checks for $49 and $22 and been convicted for the crimes roughly a decade ago, according to the BBC.

Ranking Member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) disagreed with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent that the Biden administration's lax vetting enabled the DC National Guard shooting before Thanksgiving.

Both Noem and Kent disagreed, with the Homeland secretary balking at Thompson's choice of words that the shooting — which killed one National Guardswoman and injured another — was merely an ""unfortunate situation.""

""It was a terrorist attack,"" Noem informed Thompson.

""The individual was vetted to serve as a soldier in Afghanistan, and that vetting standard was used by the Biden administration as a ruse to bring him here,"" added Kent.

""Had we followed the standard operating procedures for special immigrant visas from that individual, and none of the allies welcome, people would have come to America. That's on Joe Biden.""

FBI National Security Operations Director Michael Glasheen told lawmakers in the hearing that probing Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization is currently a ""primary"" focus for the bureau — prompting the top Democrat on the House panel to question how much he's learned about it.

""What I see from my position is that's the most immediate violent threat that we're seeing on the domestic side,"" Glasheen said.

""Where is Antifa headquartered?"" asked Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).

""We are building out the infrastructure right now,"" responded Glasheen.

""So what does that mean?"" Thompson asked, growing testy. ""I'm just we're trying to get — if you say Antifa is a terrorist organization. Tell us as a committee, how did you come to that? ... How many members do they have in the United States? As of right now?""

""Well, that's very fluid. It's, it's ongoing for us to understand that,"" added Glasheen, saying the group was considered ""no different than al Qaeda and ISIS.""

The FBI official said the active investigation precluded him from sharing any further details.

Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, referred to the ambush attack against two National Guard members in DC, killing one, as an ""unfortunate accident.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quickly stepped to correct the Democrat about the Thanksgiving Eve attack in downtown DC.

""Unfortunate accident? It was a terrorist attack. They shot our Guardsmen in the head,"" she said.

Thompson (D-Miss.) called on Noem to resign in his opening remarks of the hearing.

""Do a real service to the country and just resign,"" Thompson says, ""that is, if President Trump doesn't fire you first.""

The Mississippi Democrat accused Noem of ""putting her own interests above the law"" in enforcing immigration crackdowns and making America ""less safe.""",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/noem-comp1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-11 12:57:35.326246

“A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,” Trump wrote on Wednesday on social media.

An official government webpage promises US residency “in record time” with the new “Trump Gold Card” – once applicants have paid a $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), passed a background check and paid up $1m.

Per a September executive order, individuals are required to pay $1m, while businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m. Firms then need to pay a 1% annual maintenance fee of $20,000, and a 5% transfer fee of $100,000 each time they want to switch the visa from one employee to another.

The program comes as the Trump administration devotes significant resources to deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. The gold card program has already faced heavy criticism by seemingly contradicting the US’s traditional reputation as a refuge for the hardworking poor.

A “Trump Platinum Card” is also “coming soon”, according to the official website. This card will allow holders to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. It will cost $5m.

According to Trump, proceeds from the new program will go to “an account where we can do things positive for the country” and that it will generate “many billions of dollars”.

Trump signed an executive order in September announcing the official launch of the gold card. When the program was first reported in February, the price for a visa was $5m. The discounted price tag may give the card a competitive edge compared with similar “pay to jump the line” programs in other countries. For example, New Zealand’s new golden visa program costs nearly $3m (US dollars), but managed to attract strong interest from wealthy Americans following Trump’s re-election.

“Essentially, we’re having people come in, people that, in many cases, I guess, are very successful or whatever,” the president said back in September. “They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in.

A few days after EU countries agreed to the new rules on repatriation and safe countries, Italy and Denmark are advancing in the process of revision of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) triggered in May: on board now are 27 Council of Europe member states, which have approved a joint statement on the need for the ECHR to “effectively address migration challenges.”

“We need to launch a reflection on the capacity of international conventions to deal with the challenge of irregular flows,” Meloni insisted only yesterday, speaking remotely at the conference of the Global Alliance against the Smuggling of Migrants, a meeting of some 80 countries convened by Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa in Brussels to testify to the European grip on immigration. Meloni found in her Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, the perfect ally: in the still ongoing semester in which Copenhagen held the presidency of the EU Council, the acceleration was clear.

On 23 May, Italy and Denmark initiated the dispute over the ECHR with an open letter, also signed by Austria, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. A few months later, they were joined by Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. A total of 27 of the 46 member countries of the Council of Europe, the international body that drafted the Convention in 1950.

“Our governments have a duty to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of our peoples, including the right to live in peace, freedom and security, to preserve the values of our societies and to effectively protect our borders, prevent illegal border crossings and counter migrant smuggling networks,” the joint statement begins. Putting the freedoms of Europeans to a “severe test,” according to Meloni, Frederiksen and the others are the “people who take advantage of our hospitality by committing serious crimes, human trafficking and instrumentalisation of migrants.”

Challenges that “were unforeseeable” 75 years ago, and which now make a thorough readjustment of the Convention “imperative,” so that the iron fist launched with the new laws does not risk being stopped by the European Court of Human Rights. The ECHR must step aside and allow governments “to deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes,” even if their family resides in the host country, the 27 signatories demand. It must also “bring clarity” on inhuman and degrading treatment, which is “an absolute right” but “should be constrained to the most serious issues so as not to prevent States Parties from taking proportionate decisions on deportation of foreign criminals or in cases of removal or extradition.” And it should not pry into “innovative solutions,” and a

State Party should not be prevented

from entering into cooperation with third countries regarding asylum and return procedures,

once the human rights of irregular migrants are preserved.” It must not touch the “Albania model,” which is now “a reality in Europe,” the Italian premier claimed.

For Frederiksen, it is nothing more than “an adjustment of the balance between the important public interests of defending freedom and security in our societies and the individual rights of foreign criminals.” For Meloni, it is about ensuring that the security of citizens “is not subordinated to interpretations of the law that could end up rewarding individuals who have committed serious violations.”

Faced with the stance of the majority of member states, the Council of Europe adopted yesterday a set of conclusions on the need to draft a political declaration on migration issues and the European Convention on Human Rights. The opening is clear: “The instrumentalisation of migration, smuggling of migrants, trafficking in human beings and other criminal activities that threaten stability and security are real challenges, and it is legitimate to address them,” said Secretary General Alain Berset.

It will be the turn of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers—composed of the foreign ministers of the 46 member states —to draft a draft political declaration taking into account the “fundamental responsibility of governments to protect essential national interests, such as security and public safety.” The aim is to adopt such a declaration at the next ministerial meeting on 15 May 2026 in Chișinău, Moldova.",https://www.eunews.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251002__20251002-135233-L-2__v1__HighRes__DenmarkEuSummit-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 16:00:17.690335

A federal judge in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday ordered the release of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia from federal immigration custody in Pennsylvania — a long-awaited update in an extraordinary case that has dominated international headlines and federal court dockets for nearly 10 months.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia released from the ICE Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa., on the grounds that the Trump administration had not obtained the final notice of removal order that is needed to deport him to a third country, including a list of African nations they had previously identified for his removal.

""Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,"" Xinis said in her order on Thursday.

""For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.""

US JUDGE VOWS TO RULE 'SOON' ON ABREGO GARCIA'S FATE AFTER MARATHON HEARING

Xinis in November had used a lengthy evidentiary hearing to press lawyers for the Trump administration on whether it had the final order needed to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. to a third country, including the African nations identified by government officials.

Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign suggested then that the immigration judge who ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be removed back to his home country of El Salvador had ""meant,"" or implied a final order of removal — a notion Xinis dismissed in her ruling.

""No such order of removal exists for Abrego Garcia,"" she said.

The Justice Department is almost certain to appeal her order to a higher court, as Ensign indicated they would do in previous hearings.

Xinis had said last month that without final notice of removal, Abrego Garcia would be ""at a minimum"" entitled to certain relief. She cited Supreme Court precedent under Zadvydas v. Davis, which bars the government from indefinitely detaining migrants after removal issues have been ordered.

FEDERAL JUDGE EXTENDS ARGUMENTS IN ABREGO GARCIA CASE, SLAMS ICE WITNESS WHO 'KNEW NOTHING'

Abrego Garcia's status since March has been at the center of a legal and political maelstrom, when he was deported to his home country of El Salvador, in violation of a 2019 court order and in what Trump officials acknowledge was an ""administrative error."" Xinis ordered then that Abrego Garcia be ""immediately"" returned to the U.S.

Critics argue the months-long legal fight that ensued has allowed the Trump administration to test its mettle on immigration enforcement, as well as its ability to slow-walk or evade compliance with federal courts.

Senior DHS and Justice Department officials, for their part, have disputed that accusation.

They have also been sharply critical of Xinis and other federal judges presiding over deportation cages, whom they have repeatedly accused of overstepping their authority as a district judge.

""This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday in response to the order.

Upon his return to the U.S. in June, Abrego Garcia was immediately taken into federal custody in Nashville and detained on human smuggling charges, stemming from a 2022 traffic stop.

Government officials later acknowledged that the investigation into the traffic stop began when Abrego Garcia was still detained in El Salvador, prompting new questions as to the process of securing the indictment.

A federal judge in Tennessee has been hearing from the government and Abrego Garcia's lawyers on his motion to dismiss that case on the grounds of vindictive and selective prosecution.

A hearing on the motion to dismiss has been scheduled in Nashville for early next month.

ABREGO GARCIA REMAINS IN US FOR NOW AS JUDGE TAKES CASE UNDER ADVISEMENT

Xinis had also pressed Trump officials on why they could not deport Abrego Garcia to the third county of Costa Rica, whose government had granted the necessary assurances that they would not detain him or refoul him back to his home country of El Salvador.

Trump officials previously told her in court that Costa Rica was ""off the table,"" though they did not provide evidence.

Subsequent court filings appear to show that Costa Rica had not reneged on its agreement to accept Abrego Garcia into their country, casting renewed doubt on that claim.

The order from Xinis comes after lawyers for the Trump administration repeatedly asked Xinis to dissolve an emergency order she handed down in August, which required Abrego Garcia to remain in U.S. immigration custody, and within 200 miles of her court.

ABREGO GARCIA LAWYERS ASK US JUDGE TO ORDER RETURN TO MARYLAND AMID ONGOING CRIMINAL CASE

Xinis's order also ostensibly allows Abrego Garcia to remain in the U.S. with his brother, pending trial in the criminal case in Nashville.

The Trump administration previously tried and failed to remove Abrego Garcia to the African countries of Liberia, Eswatini, Uganda and briefly, Ghana.

Xinis noted in late November that the government cannot take any of those steps without the final notice of removal order.

At the time, an immigration judge concluded that he was likely to be targeted for violence by a gang in his home country.

After Abrego sued over his illegal deportation, Xinis quickly ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego’s return, a decision largely upheld by the Supreme Court. Administration officials, who publicly resisted Xinis’ command, ultimately returned Abrego in June after securing a grand jury indictment against him for human smuggling. Abrego is fighting those charges in Tennessee, where another federal judge has found a persuasive case that the indictment was brought with a vindictive motive.

Abrego’s case has become a symbol of the administration’s haphazard mass deportation rush, which has met stiff resistance in federal courts that have repeatedly described abuses, violations of due process, abhorrent conditions in immigration facilities and erroneous deportations.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the administration will “continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” calling Xinis’ order “judicial activism by an Obama appointed judge.”

Administration officials have accused Abrego, who illegally entered the United States around 2011 as a 16-year-old, of belonging to the violent gang MS-13, a contention Abrego has denied. Judges have repeatedly questioned the slim evidence prosecutors have presented of those allegations, despite repeated claims by President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior administration officials.

Abrego has signaled that he would be willing to accept deportation to Costa Rica, a country that has indicated it would welcome him there as a refugee. But the administration has floated plans to send him to several African nations, including Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia. Xinis cited these efforts as examples of the administration’s apparent drive to punish Abrego rather than secure his deportation.

Xinis also said it appeared the administration had misrepresented whether Costa Rica remained an option for Abrego’s deportation, saying in court that it was no longer on the table, only to be contradicted by a senior Costa Rican government official.

The administration’s “persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” Xinis wrote.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbc%2F57%2Fa0923d8a4dbba205572f8a2f361b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2231999229,N,,2025-12-11 12:58:16.985334

WASHINGTON — Today, instead of addressing the massive premium increases about to hit families nationwide due to expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, the Senate majority is pushing for new federal restrictions on abortion coverage in private insurance plans, to decimate access to gender affirming care, and to erect additional hurdles to health care for immigrants.

The bill has been offered as an alternative to renewing tax credits to make health insurance affordable for more than 22 million people. In addition to not adequately addressing the looming health care affordability crisis, it would prohibit millions of people who get health insurance through the ACA from paying for private plans that include abortion coverage, which will dissuade private insurance coverage of abortion and push abortion care out of reach for people across the country, including in states where it is legal.

The bill would also prohibit people on exchange plans, Medicaid, and CHIP from accessing gender-affirming medical care and add complicated hurdles for immigrants to access Medicaid coverage, including penalizing states that use their own money to cover health care costs for those who are excluded from Medicaid. Under these provisions, millions of eligible people could have essential care denied or delayed, including those who are part of mixed status families or citizens who simply fear being exposed to overzealous immigration enforcement.

In response to the Senate’s upcoming vote on S.3386, American Civil Liberties Union National Director of Policy & Government Affairs Mike Zamore released the following statement:

“Today, instead of acting to prevent massive health premiums hikes in three weeks, the Senate majority is working to make the health crisis even worse for families across the country by stripping the coverage of life-saving care in order to pursue their ideological agenda. Instead of lowering costs, the bill would prevent people from accessing abortion through ACA health care coverage, block access to medically necessary gender affirming care, and punish states for trying to extend coverage to their uninsured residents.

“A serious solution is still needed to address expiring ACA tax credits without sacrificing people’s access to essential health care services. The Trump administration and the congressional majority must stop playing political games with the health care of the American people before millions see their premiums skyrocket and their quality of care drastically decline.”

The report estimates ICE arrests rose more than threefold between December 2024 and June of this year — from just over 8,300 to more than 29,000.
“ICE arrests are having chilling effects on groups that are not eligible for deportation,” Herbst said.
Trump’s policy decision to rescind “sensitive location” status for places like day cares has translated into more immigration enforcement arrests near centers.
Herbst said he expects disruptions not just to the child care sector but to other industries that are immigrant intensive.","A jump in immigration enforcement arrests under the Trump administration is having a detrimental impact on America’s child care system, reducing the number of immigrant workers available and prompting mothers with young children to leave their jobs as they scramble for stable care.

That’s according to a report released Wednesday by the Better Life Lab at the nonprofit New America, which examined how increased arrests during the first half of the year by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has had a ripple effect on a women-led child care workforce where about 1 in 5 workers are immigrants.

The report estimates there are roughly 39,000 fewer foreign-born child care workers since Trump took office in January. There are also 77,000 fewer American mothers of preschool-aged children in the workforce since that time, a result that researchers found is tied to the impact of ICE arrests. Mothers have already been exiting the workforce in droves.

“It’s not surprising that we find that disruptions to the child care market vis-à-vis an increase in immigration enforcement has led to a decline in the number of foreign-born workers, and because of the disruptions in the child care market, this has led to spillovers in the labor market for mothers with kids more generally,” said Chris M. Herbst, one of the authors of the report and a professor of public policy at Arizona State University whose research includes the economics of child care. “These kinds of immigration-induced disruptions have had negative labor market implications.”

The group analyzed federal labor statistics and newly compiled ICE arrest data between September 2023 and July 2025 and found that immigrant labor — both among foreign-born and U.S.-born child care workers — decreased as arrests spiked this year and workers tried to avoid being targeted by ICE agents. The report estimates ICE arrests rose more than threefold between December 2024 and June of this year — from just over 8,300 to more than 29,000.

The dynamics also appear to be shifting some workers away from formal center- and home-based employment settings toward private households in work as a babysitter, nanny or au pair. Those shifts may reduce the total number of spots a day care can offer.

“Pay is often under the table, and there’s no formal regulation of this sector,” Herbst said. “We don’t know if it’s high quality, if it’s low quality, how good the pay is — but what it is is less visible, and workers may feel less vulnerable as a result.”

The drop in foreign-born child care workers is most pronounced among highly educated immigrants and those from Mexico. There’s also a 30 percent decrease among Hispanic workers, particularly Mexican workers, born in the United States. ICE agents have also detained U.S. citizens amid widespread arrests.

“ICE arrests are having chilling effects on groups that are not eligible for deportation,” Herbst said. “U.S.-born workers of any race or ethnicity are not eligible for deportation, and the fact that we’re seeing reductions in U.S.-born employment among Hispanics, in particular Mexicans, speaks potentially to this chilling effect that ICE is having on these workers.”

Herbst said the administration sold mass deportations on the theory that they would unclog the labor market and create more job opportunities for Americans. That’s not what is playing out in the child care industry, which shows how immigrants and U.S. citizens don’t always compete for the same jobs.

“When a foreign-born worker is not showing up to work anymore because they’re scared, it makes the U.S.-born worker in that program — it makes it more difficult for them to do their jobs because they are doing complementary tasks rather than serving as substitutes for one another.”

The changes to the child care workforce are also impacting employment opportunities among U.S. mothers with preschool-aged children, especially White mothers and those who are highly educated.

“Parents, mothers in particular, rely on having stable child care available in order to work. And

when you increase instability in the child care market, essentially by ramping up immigration enforcement, you’re scaring the heck out of a lot of workers who are no longer going to show up,” Herbst said. “Because of that, the nation’s ability to provide child care services has declined. Families can no longer find the needed child care to go to work, and as a result, we’re seeing in the data, there are fewer mothers employed.”

This is not the first time researchers have examined the impact of immigration enforcement on child care. A federal program aimed at checking the immigration status of people arrested by local police and in effect between 2008 and 2013 also reduced the foreign-born child care work force and decreased the workforce among American mothers with young children.

Trump has made mass immigrant deportation a central policy during his second term. The scope of related arrests and subsequent detentions has included people without criminal backgrounds, including pregnant and postpartum people, and reached into locations once deemed sensitive by the federal government like schools, hospitals and churches.

Trump’s policy decision to rescind “sensitive location” status for places like day cares has translated into more immigration enforcement arrests near centers. A recent arrest of a day care worker inside a Chicago area center as children watched garnered national outrage.

Immigration arrests are expected to continue in the new year. Congress approved a massive tax law last summer that included $170 billion over the next four years for immigration enforcement, including for detentions and deportations. Researchers believe as ICE hires more officers and ramps up arrests, the child care sector could be further harmed.

Herbst said he expects disruptions not just to the child care sector but to other industries that are immigrant intensive.

“What I hope our paper does is start to get people thinking about the trade offs involved in this kind of immigration enforcement policy,” he said. “It’s been sold to us as a policy that’s going to be a boon for American workers, for U.S.-born workers. But I think what we’re finding is that there are trade offs.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice-childcare.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 14:58:30.483144

“His removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,” Xinis wrote in a memo. She continued, “Since Abrego Garcia’s wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority.”

The ruling Thursday is the latest in a case that has highlighted the Trump administration’s enforcement policies in pursuit of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

The case first gained international attention when federal government officials admitted in April that they had made an “administrative error” that landed Abrego in the notorious Salvadoran megaprison — known as CECOT — even though a 2019 court order barred authorities from deporting him to his native El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that Abrego is a member of MS-13, a Salvadoran gang, who should not be allowed to stay in the United States. Abrego’s family and attorneys have denied the gang affiliation accusations, also adding that he has not been convicted of any crimes.

Government officials have continued their efforts to remove Abrego from the U.S. under new third-country deportation policies. Court records show the Trump administration has discussed deporting Abrego to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Costa Rica.

President Trump has repeatedly said that in enforcing immigration policy, he would deport criminals, rapists and the worst of the worst. But new data reveals that in the first nine months of the president's second term, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 74,000 people with no criminal record. That's more than a third of the total ICE arrests in that period. Those numbers were provided by ICE to the Deportation Data Project, a joint initiative of UCLA and UC Berkeley Law and analyzed by NPR. For more, I spoke to Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. And I started by asking him what this says about the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement.

ARIEL RUIZ SOTO: Well, at first, it contradicts the earlier messaging from the Trump administration that it's focused on the worst to the worst and targeting criminal convictions. However, recently, the administration has also said that anybody here in the United States without legal status will be subject to deportation in the future.

FADEL: Well, let's get to what is a crime and what's not. We hear from the administration not just the claims that they're arresting rapists and gang members, but also, they say that anyone in the country without proper paperwork is a criminal. Is that true that being undocumented means you've committed a crime?

RUIZ SOTO: Under immigration law, entering the country without proper authorization is a lower offense compared to those that we colloquially think are criminal convictions in a more criminal system, meaning, for example, murder, rape, drug abuse or something else like that that could get it to be higher.

FADEL: What do we know about the other two-thirds of these arrests? Do they all have criminal histories?

RUIZ SOTO: No. Among the other two-thirds, about half of those are actually people with a criminal pending charge but not yet proven guilty. Of those that do have a criminal conviction, we know from previous reports from ICE and experience that we've done research on that the majority of those criminal convictions tend to be traffic violations or lower-level offenses.

FADEL: Was that surprising to you?

RUIZ SOTO: I didn't think it was surprising because it's been happening over months. I think the visibility has been surprising. And perhaps the other aspect of this that has been also not transparent is this is just for ICE arrests. We don't know yet how many arrests are being made by Border Patrol across the different cities they're now targeting to consider the full impact of this new enforcement.

FADEL: What has this meant for immigrant communities, mixed-status communities and families when it comes to their presence in the United States and their relationship with law enforcement and the government?

RUIZ SOTO: Well, the direct impact is on those people that are here without status. Many of them are not going outside their homes. But I think the bigger impact here is that mixed-status families are also affected. The fact, for example, that families may forgo seeking benefits that are eligible for their U.S. citizen children because they're afraid of potentially being detained or arrested, that actually has implications for U.S. citizens and many of these citizens. In fact, 5.3 million U.S. citizen children have one parent who is undocumented in the United States, and that could actually make a significant difference in their separation.

FADEL: What would you say to people listening who say, well, I mean, people should not have entered without status, and this is the consequence?

RUIZ SOTO: Well, it's clear that migrants who are here without status are subject to deportation and arrest, but people have access to due process. They need to have an opportunity to present their claims to why they should stay in the United States. And if in the end of that litigation, it is determined that the person has to leave the United States, and that should be the case.

FADEL: Ariel Ruiz Soto is a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Thank you so much for your time.

RUIZ SOTO: Thank you.

FADEL: We reached out to ICE for comment and have not heard back. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

In the spring of last year, then-President Joe Biden tried to convince skeptical voters that the struggling economy was healthy. Then-candidate Donald Trump seized on the moment and vowed to lower prices for American consumers, beating his eventual Democratic rival Kamala Harris in part with a winning economic message.

Now it's President Trump who's trying to persuade the public that the state of the economy is sound, after prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in September and with consumers spending less on big-ticket items.

Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, says making that argument could be a tall order in the face of rising costs for a number of goods and services.

""My personal takeaway from the experience we had [in 2024] was that you can't tell people that prices aren't up when they're up,"" she said.

While the prices of some items such as gasoline have fallen on Trump's watch, the overall cost of living has continued to climb. For example, grocery costs are up 2.7% for the year ending in September and electricity costs have jumped more than 5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Trump's claims about inflation are false,"" Stevenson said, ""and you can go to the grocery store and see it yourself.""

But, in a wide-ranging speech to supporters on Tuesday, Trump both defended his administration's track record on the economy and said that talk of affordability was overblown. Trump told the crowd in Mount Pocono, Pa., that he believed the term ""affordability"" was a ""hoax"" perpetrated by Democrats. Trump's recent assertions dismissing inflation are not backed by official government economic data.

Consumers are feeling high prices firsthand

While it's true that inflation hit a 9% high during the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, that was during the pandemic and it dropped significantly after that. Inflation dipped to an annual rate of 3% in January during Biden's final month in office, the same rate it was in September under Trump.

Now many voters are questioning how well Trump is tackling the stubbornly high costs of everyday items. Some 57% of voters said in a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released this week that Trump was ""losing the battle against inflation,"" while 68% of respondents to a AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October said the economy was poor or very poor.

Voters' souring attitudes on the Trump administration's handling of the economy come less than a year before the U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans will aim to maintain their majorities in both houses of Congress. But in a warning sign for the GOP, November's odd-year races saw Democrats who campaigned on affordability win major contests in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey.

Political consultant and pollster Frank Luntz says Trump risks appearing out of touch if he continues to claim that affordability is a ""hoax"" when Americans feel like they're paying more — and actually do pay more.

""When you talk about affordability, it is all perception,"" Luntz told NPR's Morning Edition. ""The greatest danger is if you tell people happy days are here again, and it's 1929,"" he added, referencing the beginning of the Great Depression.

Luntz added that Trump blaming Biden for the failures of the economy may have worked during the campaign season and even for some time after.

""That said, it's now a year since the election, and the public does expect this administration to take charge. At a certain point, they will not accept the blame game,"" he said.

Trump's tariffs are contributing to inflation

But getting inflation to slow down or prices to drop will be easier said than done for the Trump administration, which has embraced economic policies such as tariffs that force prices upward, according to Stevenson. Trump and other administration officials have argued that tariffs are necessary to correct past global trade policies that have been unfair to the U.S. and to bring back domestic manufacturing.

Although tariffs are raising about $30 billion per month in revenue for U.S. coffers, the new import taxes levied by the Trump administration have increased prices on a number of items, from food to clothing to furniture.

""What I find surprising is that he's out there telling people: 'This isn't happening. This is a con job. There's no affordability problem,'"" Stevenson said. ""At the same time, he's pursuing policies that are purposefully restricting supply, which every person who has taken even an introductory economics course knows will push up prices.""

Still, the administration has taken several steps recently to ease the negative effects of tariffs on U.S. consumers and producers. Last month, Trump scrapped the tariffs on certain products that aren't widely produced in the U.S., such as bananas and coffee. And on Monday the administration announced that it was making $12 billion in one-time payments to U.S. farmers to offset their rising business costs.

But as soon as we heard Rosalía's magnificent, head-spinning LUX in early November, one spot on our list was instantly confirmed.

For most of the year, consensus felt hard to come by. We all found plenty of music to love, but we weren't always drawn toward the same signals. LUX was different. Of the dozen critics and hosts who submitted lists (you can, and should, check out each of their lists, starting with their highest recommendations here), more than half included it in their top 10. Four of us said it was the best thing we heard all year. Below, each of them makes the argument for why it deserves that crown.

LUX is high art

It's hard to describe Rosalía's artiest and most audacious left turn without rattling off statistics and credentials. ""She sings in more than a dozen languages!"" ""She's working with the London Symphony Orchestra, and also Björk, and did you know that Caroline Shaw helped with arrangements?!"" A work rich in footnotes, LUX spills over with lore about female saints, enhanced by efforts to translate, unpack and otherwise reckon with it.

LUX is a work of high art, sure. But it's also frequently, boldly, at times breathtakingly beautiful — a work of craft and care, empathy and deep emotion. ""Reliquia"" mutates from an orchestral piece into an electro-pop reverie, with a tear-jerking piano interlude along the way, and its vocal remains pristine enough to induce gasps. That's just one song among 18. — Stephen Thompson

LUX transcends genre

Taking the full measure of what Rosalía pulls off on LUX is like trying to solve a single-line logic puzzle: Connect opera to maximalist pop to flamenco to electronica to Baroque orchestral music to rap (and much more) without lifting your pen or crossing any lines. It feels impossible. But Rosalía shows how with a profoundly stirring, unified feast for the ears. It's less reggaeton or bachata and more like reggaeton and bachata and Sigur Rós performing Les Misérables, with Feist and Maria Callas trading lead vocals.

But LUX isn't just sonic gymnastics. Deeply considered and exhaustively researched, it's a monument to both the incomprehensible mess and breathtaking wonder of being human, shifting seamlessly between fragile beauty and childlike magic to raw, lustful desire. It's as graphic and startling as it is rapturous and divine. And yeah, it's performed in 13 different languages, as Rosalía delivers a vast exegesis on everything from religion and sex to mortality and violence.

Arriving near the end of a brutally divisive year of attacks on identity and ""otherness,"" LUX feels — and sounds — like the best possible reply, a necessary and potent reminder of the humanity that binds us and the miracle of being here at all. — Robin Hilton

LUX belongs in a lineage with one of the most beloved jazz albums of all time

After listening to LUX for the first time, I spent days trying to understand why it felt both new and familiar. Then it hit me: The more I listened and read Rosalía's deeply personal lyrics, the more it reminded me of jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's seminal spiritual statement, A Love Supreme.

Hear me out.

Rosalía prepared herself for this moment by dividing her album into four parts, exploring feminine mysticism, transformation, transcendence and intimacy, subjects that curiously echo A Love Supreme's album track listings of ""Acknowledgement,"" ""Resolution,"" ""Pursuance"" and ""Psalm.""

By the time Coltrane recorded A Love Supreme in 1964, he had already experienced what he called a spiritual awakening that helped him kick addictions to alcohol and heroin, while exploring the sonic and musical limits of his saxophone. A Love Supreme is his moment of coming face to face with God. On LUX, after almost an hour's worth of intense and very musical meditations on things like feminine mysticism, light versus dark as well as spirituality and sacredness, Rosalía also comes face to face with God. But she asks God to meet her halfway: ""God descends and I ascend / We meet in the middle.""

Both of these albums are artfully crafted statements by artists with uncommon powers of musical communication who share with us spiritual journeys so personal that at times they feel like invasions of privacy. LUX meets the musical legacy of A Love Supreme in the middle and picks up where that classic left off. — Felix Contreras

LUX is still, at its heart, a spectacular flamenco record

Flamenco feels like the sonic representation of the moment when Eve took a bite of the apple. Cast in an ancient fire so alive it's impossible to put out or pin down, its deceptiveness is its defiance. As experimental, big and seemingly novel as Rosalía's LUX is, it sounds like one thing: her spirit. Which — as she's chameleoned across the world — stays firmly rooted in flamenco's eternal flame.

She approached this record as she does all others: global eyes, an open heart and a Spanish soul. Flamenco is pastoral music, once used for basic communication and connection. Those original sounds — sweet lyrical lullabies and softly stroked strings — gave into temptation and fell in love with pain, fear, sadness, giving way to guttural cries and desperate strums.

On LUX, there's something beyond technical ingenuity or global experience to the way the music — and its maker — morphs from track to track. What ties an entire world of sounds and languages together is an artist who enters a sonic moment and complicates it, tears it down, ruining beautiful things with a deep human-ness. Flamenco is etched in concrete yet almost always vibrating, changing; striking palms cutting up some of the most shape-shifting, dynamic vocals on Earth. Ten notes within one, a hundred emotions in two breaths. Despite apparent sonic distance, LUX may be Rosalía's most flamenco album yet. — Anamaria Sayre

Subsidies for the Affordable Care Act appear set to expire for millions of Americans at the end of the year after competing health care related bills failed to advance in the Senate on Thursday.

The outcome was widely expected after Democrats and Republicans chose to release separate partisan proposals. Both parties are under pressure to address health care costs before the expiration of federal subsidies meant to lower the cost of premiums on ACA plans. Those subsidies expire at the end of 2025 and are expected to cause prices to skyrocket.

Both bills needed 60 votes to advance, but neither succeeded.

The Republican-backed plan failed by a vote of 51 to 48. The measure, authored by Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, would have provided up to $1,500 a year in payments for health savings accounts for Americans earning less than 700% of the federal poverty level.

However the bill would not have extended the ACA tax credits and the money could not be used to pay for health care premiums. Deductibles for those plans average around $7,000, according to data from the health policy organization KFF.

Democrats rejected the bill arguing it did nothing to address health care premiums, and opposed restrictions in the bill on abortion and gender affirming care.

""The Republican plan is a when you get sick, you go broke plan plain and simple,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said ahead of the vote.

In a trade-off to reopen the government following the longest shutdown in U.S. history, Senate Republicans promised Democrats a vote on a bill of their choosing to extend the subsidies. Democrats proposed a three-year extension of existing federal subsidies, but that measure failed 51 to 48. Four Republicans joined with Democrats: Susan Collins of Maine, Missouri's Josh Hawley, and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.

Republicans have argued that extending the subsidies would allow what they describe as Obamacare ""waste, fraud and abuse"" to continue, while lining the pockets of insurance companies.

""There is nothing in their [Democrats] bill that stops billions of dollars in fraudulent spending,"" Cassidy said on the Senate floor Wednesday.

The failed votes on Thursday left the future of the ACA subsidies even further in doubt. GOP leaders in the House are signaling a potential vote in coming days on legislation to address health care costs, but the party has yet to coalesce behind a plan.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said that starting next week, the House would begin voting ""on bills that will focus on lowering premiums for 100% of Americans.""

""Let's see where Democrats stand when its not just giving money to insurance companies and propping up failed Obamacare plans,"" Scalise said.

The fight over the subsidies has once again exposed a split inside the GOP over how to control rising healthcare costs — a debate that has snarled the party since the ACA first passed in 2010.

While some Republicans say they are prepared to watch the subsidies lapse, others have joined with Democrats to press for an extension. In the House, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., has partnered with Jared Golden, D-Maine, on a plan to extend the credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. A separate plan from Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., would extend the subsidies for one year. The bill has more than a dozen Republican cosponsors.

Both proposals were filed through a rare legislative tactic known as a discharge petition — a workaround that lets members force a vote without the approval of leadership or committees if they can first secure 218 signatures in support.

For his part, President Trump has largely remained hands off. He has been sharply critical of the ACA subsidies, and while he has not endorsed a specific proposal he has voiced support for sending money directly to Americans to pay for care.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed7ceab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5777x3033+0+409/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F17%2F6b9b830a45e59c8845b764e9a3b1%2Fgettyimages-2226391006.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:58:35.752575

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.”

Justice Department and Homeland Security spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the judge’s order. Messages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia’s attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His lawsuit in federal court claims Trump’s Republican administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish Abrego Garcia over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.

Meanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States.

Additionally, Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.

A judge has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.”

The judge specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ff5695/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2F20%2Fe4ca76c44460b4ea43a154496217%2Fd3e59abf675c4cba94d2bde1962b52d5.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:00:30.084015

In President Donald Trump’s simple and provocative language, Somali immigrants to the US, even US citizens, are “garbage.”

“Send her back!” was the chant from supporters about Rep. Ilhan Omar, the elected member of Congress, at a campaign-style event Tuesday night.

“Throw her the hell out!” Trump said.

This is a complaint about legal immigration

Trump also reminded everyone of the episode in his first term when he complained that the US was accepting immigrants from “shithole” countries.

“Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden?” Trump asked the Pennsylvania crowd. “Send us some nice people, do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Stephen Miller, the White House aide who seems to hold outsized authority over much of Trump’s agenda, in particular on immigration, expanded on these ideas on Fox News in an interview earlier Tuesday.

Both Miller and Trump have seized upon a growing pandemic relief scandal in Minnesota to disparage the entire Somali immigrant community, much of which came to the country legally beginning in the 1990s.

Pining for the pre-Civil Rights era

Miller suggested the country was better off with strict quotas that sought to preserve the racial makeup of the country in the 1920s and favored immigrants from Western and Northern Europe over what he called “third world countries.”

That period was, in Miller’s view, the “cauldron through which a unified shared national identity was formed.” He drew a line between the great events in that 50-year period of US history and negative migration. Back then, it was Swedish immigrants living in the Minneapolis neighborhood where Somalis have now settled.

A law that changed the country

The legislation was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the Statue of Liberty in 1965, and its goal was to prioritize skills and abilities of legal immigrants. Previous law had demanded that the racial and cultural makeup of the country not be changed as a result of immigration.

“It corrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American nation,” Johnson said at the time.

He argued the system of quotas based on country of origin violated the founding precept of the country:

JOHNSON: Men of needed skill and talent were denied entrance because they came from southern or eastern Europe or from one of the developing continents. This system violated the basic principle of American democracy — the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.

Immigration surged, primarily from Latin America and Asia, while European immigration fell.

A key moment for Civil Rights

The historian Mark Updegrove, who is CEO of the LBJ Presidential Library, puts the immigration law alongside the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act as key pieces of Civil Rights legislation that changed the country.

“What LBJ said is that we shouldn’t be asking people where they’re from; we should be asking people what can you do for our country,” he said. “It opened up opportunities for people who, to that point, had been banned from coming to the United States simply by virtue of their ethnicity or country of origin, which is ridiculous.”

The law also represented one of the few times Congress has been able to come together to address immigration in a comprehensive way.

‘Third world countries’

Miller’s complaint, expressed on Fox News, is that the 1965 law attracted more people from “third world” countries who he argued have failed to assimilate in the US.

“What you saw between 1965 and today was the single largest experiment on a society, on a civilization, that had ever been conducted in human history,” Miller argued.

In his view, immigrant groups like Somali-Americans, who sought refuge in Minnesota starting in the 1990s, failed as Americans. And he said their natural born citizen children have also failed. On natural born citizenship, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to ignore the plain language of what’s in the Constitution.

“With a lot of these immigrant groups, not only is the first generation unsuccessful — again, Somalia is a clear example … but you see very persistent issues in every subsequent generation. You see consistent high rates of welfare use, high rates of criminal activity, consistent failures to assimilate.”

CNN’s recent reporting, on the other hand, suggests Minnesota is still welcoming to the Somali immigrants, most of them now citizens having natural born citizen children.

A nod to replacement theory

That’s not what Miller sees, for either Somalis or other immigrant groups. Think back to when Trump falsely accused Haitian immigrants legally in the US of eating dogs in Ohio. Borrowing, at least in spirit, from the objectively racist concept of replacement theory, Miller said immigrants from “third world” countries are going to bring the US down.

“It’s just common sense. If Somalians cannot make Somalia successful, why would that we think that the track record would be any different in the United States?” he said, pointing also to immigrants from other African countries.

“If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country, what do you think will happen? You will replicate the conditions they left,” he said.

Immigration as the root problem of many US problems

Miller, becoming animated, pointed to education, health care, public safety and deficit spending, which is just about the waterfront of societal issues.

MILLER: If you subtract immigration out of test scores, all of a sudden our test scores skyrocket! If you subtract immigration out of health care, all of a sudden we don’t have near to the size of the health care challenges our country faces. If you subtract immigration out of public safety, all of a sudden we don’t have violent crime in so many of our cities. Issue after issue we talk about these things as they things just happen to us. The schools just suddenly fail. Violent crime just suddenly explodes. The deficit just suddenly skyrockets. These are a result of social policy choices that we made through immigration.

Miller’s argument lacks evidence

I put Miller’s comments to David Bier, a critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policy at the libertarian-leaning CATO institute. Bier disagreed, to put it mildly.

“His views are baseless smears based on bias, not serious analysis,” he told me by email, adding a point-by-point deconstruction of what Miller said.

BIER: Immigrants to the United States today are assimilating faster than prior generations. They are more likely to know English, more likely to have graduated college, are more economically productive, and more beneficial to government budgets than in the early 20th century. They have more experience with democracy than past waves of immigration, and they are more patriotic and more supportive of US institutions than the US-born. By the time they naturalize they have adopted almost the same political views, except for immigration policy. They are less likely to commit crimes and be incarcerated than those in the early 20th century. Immigrants today cost less to the health care system than the US-born. They are less likely to commit and be incarcerated for crimes than the US-born. Immigrants increase the returns to education for the US-born, leading more US-born to graduate. They make the US-born more productive, increasing their wages and living standards.

Imprinted all over Trump’s policies

Regardless of whether his views are based in fact, Miller’s outlook is consistently repeated in Trump’s policies, which frequently conflate legal and undocumented immigrants from countries like Somalia.

Republicans cited unverified allegations of widespread fraud to cut future Medicaid and food assistance spending. Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security has indicated she will expand a travel ban from 19 countries to include “every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Immigration paranoia fuels a new ‘Trump corollary’

The larger issue of immigration, including legal immigration, is also behind a more existential policy shift the US announced this week in a new National Security Strategy.

The document announces a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine that will see the US act against Western Hemisphere countries to make sure they are able to prevent mass migration to the US.

The document also seems to refer to migrant communities like Somalis in the US when it states that US sovereignty has been eroded by “the cynical manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to foreign interests within our country.”

‘Civilizational erasure’

The US warns in the National Security Strategy that Europe — ancestral home of the immigrants that Trump prefers — is threatened by “civilizational erasure,” an unsubtle reference to immigration to Europe.

“Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,” the document states, arguing such transformation could call into question whether European countries will remain as US allies.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2251063636.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-11 11:59:46.929933

The decision from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis grants Abrego Garcia's habeas petition to release him from custody and is a significant victory for Abrego Garcia, whose immigration case became a major flashpoint in President Trump's mass-deportation campaign when he was removed to El Salvador earlier this year.

In her order, Xinis found that there was no final order of removal from the government to deport Abrego Garcia from the United States, despite the Trump administration's repeated attempts to remove him.

""Because respondents have no statutory authority to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country absent a removal order, his removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,"" Xinis wrote in Thursday's order.

""Although respondents may eventually get it right, they have not as of today,"" the judge continued. ""Thus, Abrego Garcia's detention for the stated purpose of third country removal cannot continue. Respondents' conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer.""

The Trump administration has been attempting to re-deport Abrego Garcia to the African nations of Uganda, Eswatini or Ghana, but the countries have not agreed to accept him.

But the administration informed the court in October that Liberia had agreed to take Abrego Garcia and would seek to deport him.

The administration has ""received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in October that unless Liberia guarantees it will not send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, deporting him to the West African nation ""is no less unlawful than sending him directly"" to his home country again.

In November, the Trump administration argued that Abrego Garcia had received significant due process in the U.S. In a court filing, the Justice Department said a U.S. government asylum officer interviewed Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.

Xinis heard testimony in October from an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the Trump administration's efforts to remove Abrego Garcia, who has been in immigration custody since late August. The official, John Schultz, said the administration remains in active discussions with Eswatini about removing him there, though the east African country rejected a request to take him.

Still, Schultz said that once the administration has received word of a third country willing to accept Abrego Garcia, it could deport him within 72 hours if allowed by the court.

Abrego Garcia has said he is willing to go to Costa Rica and designated the country as his preferred country of removal, and Costa Rica has indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency. But during the hearing Oct. 10, a Justice Department lawyer said there had not been discussions about deporting him there.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of gamesmanship and deliberately seeking to remove him to countries where he could raise claims of reasonable fear of persecution, with the goal of keeping him detained for longer.

Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador in 2011 and has lived in Maryland with his wife and children. But he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported to his home country, despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to El Salvador because of possible persecution by local gangs.

As part of a civil case Abrego Garcia and his wife brought against the Trump administration, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return back to the U.S. But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty, and a judge in Tennessee ordered him to be released on bail ahead of a criminal trial set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because of concerns from his lawyers that immigration authorities would arrest him upon his release and deport him from the U.S.

Abrego Garcia was released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland. But days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he may be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia also filed a new legal challenge to his confinement and the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for a second time, which Xinis is presiding over. She has blocked immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S., and he has since remained in detention at a facility in Pennsylvania.

At the heart of Abrego Garcia's challenge is a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which the high court said the government cannot indefinitely detain a person in the U.S. illegally if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the ""reasonably foreseeable future.""

Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that he has been in near-continuous confinement since March, when he was deported to El Salvador and held in prisons there. His only period of freedom was for a weekend in August, in between his release from criminal custody in Tennessee and his arrest by immigration authorities in Maryland.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/08/7f0831b1-601f-433c-9e87-10208071fbb3/thumbnail/1200x630/ed71cb49184cd94d44f5217522ef3c18/gettyimages-2231358090.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 10:57:07.049217

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to testify before the House Committee on Homeland Security at 10 a.m. EST. Watch live in our video player above.

It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department’s tactics.

READ MORE: Trump’s push for mass deportation hits child care workers, who are already facing shortages

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump’s signature policy area, Thursday’s appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.

In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem’s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.

The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.

READ MORE: Trump’s immigration message collides with his welcome to World Cup fans

Noem’s department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.

The secretary’s appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador.

Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. Homeland Security says agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations do not target or arrest American citizens for immigration reasons although they say they have arrested Americans for allegedly interfering in enforcement operations.

WATCH: Trump says he doesn’t want Somali migrants in the U.S., calls people ‘garbage’

And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

Also attending Thursday’s hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.

Previous hearings have included questions on cybersecurity, China, chemical security and drones. Under President Joe Biden, at times of heavy migration at the southern border, Republicans often focused their questioning on his Democratic administration’s handling of border security.

When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen.

These are people who were born in other countries, but have made America their home. 24 million naturalized citizens is basically one out of every 13 people in the United States. Now, the Trump administration says it is prioritizing denaturalization.

Also known as stripping some of those people of their citizenship.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, we have criminals that came into our country and they were naturalized, maybe through Biden or somebody that didn't know what they were doing. If I have the power to do it, I'm not sure that I do, but if I do, I would denaturalize, absolutely.

CHAKRABARTI: President Trump speaking to reporters on Air Force one Late last month. And back in June, the U.S. Justice Department released a memo citing denaturalization as a top law enforcement priority. So when and how can the United States government actually revoke citizenship? And does Trump's claim about the danger posed by naturalized Americans really hold up?

Joining us now is Ahilan Arulanantham. He's a professor at the University of California Los Angeles Law School and Faculty co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA. Professor, welcome to On Point.

AHILAN ARULANANTHAM: Thank you for having me, Meghna.

CHAKRABARTI: I do apologize for screwing up your last name, with a name like Chakrabarti you think I would've gotten it right, but I want to get this right.

ARULANANTHAM: No worries.

CHAKRABARTI: Arulanantham.

ARULANANTHAM: Arulanantham.

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) Arulanantham. Am I dragging you back to your childhood where people ask you where you're from?

ARULANANTHAM: I'm like Chakrabarti, Chakrabarti.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Fair enough. Alright, so let's get down to actually this quite serious matter of the government amping up its efforts at denaturalization.

Let's get straight to the president's question that he said. I don't know if I have the power as president to denaturalize. Does he or does he not?

ARULANANTHAM: The power to denaturalize does exist in our law, but it's very limited. A person who makes a false statement during the naturalization process, and that false statement is critical to whether or not they would've actually been able to naturalize can be denaturalized.

So for example, if someone says on the application that they have been a green card holder for five years, but in fact they were only a green card holder for one year, then the government can go back and denaturalize that person. But I think there's two important points to recognize about the limit of that power.

One is it's wrong to suggest that just ordinary criminal convictions can be the basis for denaturalization. Because they're not, somebody who's been a naturalized citizen and then is convicted of a crime, they go to prison just like other citizens. But the fact that you've been convicted of a crime by itself does not render you eligible for denaturalization.

The fact that you've been convicted of a crime by itself does not render you eligible for denaturalization.

AHILAN ARULANANTHAM

And in that way, it's very different from deportation for non-citizens. Many crimes can result in people losing their immigration status, including even their green cards. But that's not the case for people who have naturalized. And then the second thing, which is important to recognize, is denaturalization happen[s] in federal court.

Not an immigration court. And the government can't fire the federal judges if they don't like what they're doing, as they're doing with immigration judges right now. Unfortunately. And so that means that most of the protections available in criminal cases are available in denaturalization cases.

Not all of them. There's probably not a right to appointed counsel. Depending on how the government charges a denaturalization, but almost everything else, including the very high burden of proof and the fact that all the process that's normally afforded in federal court is afforded to people in denaturalization proceedings.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so let's just clarify a couple things here. First and foremost, it is quite straightforward, as far as I read it, that if you commit fraud during your citizenship process, and that's discovered later by the federal government, that is a basis for denaturalization. Yes?

ARULANANTHAM: If the fraud would've rendered you ineligible.

CHAKRABARTI: For citizenship?

ARULANANTHAM: For citizenship, yeah. So most of the time, that's often going to be true, but occasionally it's not. If you lied about for some other reason, like to protect your husband, which is what the last Supreme Court case was about on the subject, then not. But yes, many of the frauds that you might expect would arise in this kind of situation.

Lying about something that mattered to whether or not you get your citizenship, that can be a basis, yes.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Does that extend to lying about whether or not you have a criminal record?

ARULANANTHAM: Only if the crime would've rendered you ineligible to naturalize. And not every crime does that. Some crimes don't.

It depends.

CHAKRABARTI: And then so similarly about the specificity of a committed crime. If after you become a U.S. citizen and you do commit a crime, you said for ordinary crimes, denaturalization is not an option for the federal government. But that still leaves extraordinary crimes that you could possibly lose your citizenship.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah. Extremely narrow ground for crimes, it is a charged as a federal crime, actually. I'm trying to remember the number. It might be 1451, I can't remember, but it's a federal crime, which is the crime of having obtained naturalization by fraud. That's the thing that I'm thinking of.

Lots of other crimes, if we're talking about post-naturalization conduct. Like after you become a citizen, you then engage in whatever, drug trafficking, fraud, terrorism, whatever it may be. Those are not going to be a basis for denaturalization. The government would have to show that there was actually something you said in your naturalization application from before, before the criminal activity occurred.

That was a false statement, and that would've rendered you ineligible in order to then try and connect the two things up and take away your citizenship.

And as a practical matter, that doesn't happen. You don't see cases, naturalization cases that happen on that basis.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So again, I think this process is so little understood in part because how often does it actually happen?

ARULANANTHAM: The number of cases are really rare. In the first Trump administration it was something like 25 cases a year that I think actually were charged. Which is not even a drop in the bucket when you think about all of the federal criminal cases happening, let alone all the deportation cases happening.

And that itself was a very big increase from prior years. Roughly double. I think before that It'd been like 10, 15 cases a year. So it's very rare. A lot of the small number of cases that have existed have focused on war criminals, famously Nazis who had lied about whether or not they were part of the Nazis when they came to the U.S.

And for example, like I said, the last Supreme Court case about this was about a Bosnian Serb who her husband had been involved in a war crime in Bosnia. So it's things like that, that the government has gone after people for, a very small number.

CHAKRABARTI: So is it fair to say that, what, less than 50 a year?

ARULANANTHAM: Yes. The last data I'm aware of is that it's well below that, it's like around 25 cases a year.

CHAKRABARTI: Out of the 24 million naturalized citizens in the United States.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah. Very small number.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay.

ARULANANTHAM: Of course, that --

CHAKRABARTI: No, go ahead.

ARULANANTHAM: Sorry. Just say one other thing about that. It doesn't mean that there couldn't be an attempt to vastly increase this number of cases. And of course you can have a huge amount of harassment and abuse of people if you bring criminal charges or civil denaturalization charges against them, even if they don't have a lot of merit and don't ultimately result in someone losing their citizenship. The government can do a tremendous amount of damage to people by bringing cases that are extremely weak.

So I don't want to say that this isn't something that couldn't arise in the future, but the legal basis to do it would be very flimsy, I think, to do large scale denaturalization attempts.

CHAKRABARTI: Yes. In fact, that's exactly why we're doing this show, right? Because the Trump administration has made a lot of very clear noises or statements about wanting to expand the number of people it seeks to denaturalize in this country.

And we'll talk about what, by what legal basis or policy basis they could do that. But I'd like to actually for a second if I could talk about what specifically in this June 11th memo from the Department of Justice that I referenced earlier, that said they're going to put denaturalization as a top law enforcement priority.

And let me just read a little bit from the beginning of this memo. And the memo was put out by Brett Shumate. He's the Assistant Attorney General of the United States. And in section one, it says, it references an executive order put out by President Trump called ""Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.""

Which establishes, quote: ""The policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and ... promote individual initiative excellence and hard work.""

And then the memo goes on and says: ""To this end, the president ordered all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities. As part of these efforts, attorney General Bondi has directed that the Justice Department align its litigating positions with the requirement of equal dignity and respect.""

That's an interesting way to start a memo that has to do with seeking to denaturalize more foreign-born Americans.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah. I don't know where to start with that one. I mean there's so many ways in which this administration has turned the kind of politics and policy of anti-discrimination on its head.

The president decries racism, but then repeats conspiracies about, racist conspiracies against immigrants, ends the refugee program except for white South Africans, rants against Somalis and repeats lies about Haitians eating cats and dog dogs.

I could go on and on. And unfortunately, it's not just in the statements, but it does also play out in very real ways. In policy, in the statements of the administration. So that opening to me just sounds like that, it sounds similar to many other statements that the administration has made in the context of immigration policy, civil rights enforcement, affirmative action, anti-Semitism, all of those things.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: Let's hear now from a voice who supports the Trump administration's efforts. Laura Ries. She believes that the Trump administration focus on revoking citizenship from foreign born Americans is the right idea.

Ries is director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation.

LAURA RIES: Naturalization, U.S. citizenship is the most important immigration benefit that we can confer on someone coming to the U.S. and choosing to stay here. And so we want to make sure that they are truly worthy of receiving that tremendous benefit and that they not benefit from ill-gotten gains.

CHAKRABARTI: Now, of course, the Heritage Foundation is the primary architect behind Project 2025, which specifically mentions denaturalization in its own document. Pages 143 and 144, specifically, if you want to take a look. Project 2025 advocates for, quote: ""Re-implementation of the USCIS Denaturalization Unit. An effort to maintain integrity in the system by identifying and prosecuting criminal and civil denaturalization cases in combination with the Department of Justice for aliens who obtain citizenship through fraud and other illicit means."" End quote.

Now, the Heritage Foundation's Laura Ries says she agrees with many of the categories Trump's Justice Department says it is prioritizing like people who have engaged in torture, war crimes or human rights violations.

RIES: During Biden's four years, when we experienced the highest numbers ever of people coming to the U.S., it showed us that people from all over the world want to come to the U.S. in very large numbers.

That means we can be, and we should be very choosy about who we say can come here and can stay here. Let alone who we're going to give U.S. citizenship to. If you are harming other people, harming Americans, lying about those activities, then no, you should not be given U.S. citizenship. And if you were given it, then that should be taken away.

CHAKRABARTI: Ries says, revoking citizenship for people, or excuse me, revoking citizenship from people could also, in her view, help protect against future immigration fraud.

RIES: Immigration fraud writ large, not just citizenship, is a problem. Because it is for so long, been low risk and high reward. The likelihood that you're caught or punished for it is extremely low, and the benefit of staying here is extremely high.

And that's just a recipe for fraud, and so people do exploit it, including citizenship. If you want to change behavior, change future behavior for other applicants, then you want to send the message that if you commit fraud to get an immigration benefit, you're not going to continue to benefit from that.

CHAKRABARTI: We asked Reese whether she worries that the Justice Department memo could be a slippery slope to the administration simply targeting people it does not like or agree with, and possibly revoking their citizenship.

RIES: No. I'm not worried about it. I think there's enough work to be done in the categories higher up the list, whether that is gang membership, terrorism, supporting terrorism, war crimes, et cetera, et cetera, fraud.

These cases are not easy and they're not quick. So I'm not concerned about it being done for any old reason.

CHAKRABARTI: That's Laura Ries, director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation. Now, of course, the Heritage Foundation is in the news quite a lot because of Project 2025 and how closely the Trump administration seems to be following a lot of the project's wishes or designs.

There's another note here we should mention about Heritage. In October, the organization's president Kevin Roberts defended Tucker Carlson's decision to interview white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Here's part of the video that Roberts posted on X, where he called Tucker Carlson a close friend.

KEVIN ROBERTS: The venomous coalition attacking him or sowing division, their attempt to cancel him will fail. I disagree with and even abhor things that Nick Fuentes says. But canceling him is not the answer either. Conservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.

CHAKRABARTI: Roberts faced considerable blowback for that statement, including from conservatives and from folks within the Heritage Foundation. He then said the script for his video had been written by a staffer who was reportedly reassigned and has since left the Heritage Foundation. The day after the video posted, Roberts wrote on X: ""The Heritage Foundation and I denounce ... and stand against Nick Fuentes' vicious anti-Semitic ideology, his Holocaust denial and his relentless conspiracy theories that echo the darkest chapters of history."" End quote. He then posted another video in early November, and here's a part of that.

ROBERTS: My use of the phrase venomous coalition was a terrible choice of words. It caused justified concern, especially among friends and allies who know how seriously Heritage has fought and continues to fight against the rise of antisemitism. Everyone has the responsibility to speak up against the scourge of antisemitism, no matter the messenger. Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging.

CHAKRABARTI: At least six Heritage Foundation staffers have reportedly resigned after Roberts' comments. And so there, with that background, we went back to Laura Ries and asked her whether she agreed with Robert's initial defense of Tucker Carlson's interview of White nationalist Nick Fuentes and whether she agrees with Fuentes' views.

She declined to comment on either question.

Okay, so Professor Arulanantham. Let me ask you this. You heard Laura Ries there, first of all, state something which I think a lot of Americans agree with, that it's quite a privilege to become a naturalized citizen, and so therefore, should there actually be, in a sense, a higher standard for those citizens when they are discovered as having committed fraud or a crime post or even pre or post their naturalization.

What do you think about that?

ARULANANTHAM: I agree that it's a priceless a gift or blessing to be a U.S. citizen. It affords you the ability to travel all over the world and tells you to the protection of this government. And of course, allows you to stay here. So absolutely, I agree with that.

I have no problem in principle with the concept, not just even in principle, in practice with the concept, the people who got naturalization through fraud can be prosecuted for that. And if that's why they got it, so they were actually not eligible for it, then it should be taken away. But I think that's about the last place where I think I agreed with the statements from Laura Ries.

One thing, which I think is really important where we disagree, is I really do believe that if you want to change that rule and make it so that people who just commit crimes can be denaturalized as a result of that, then you really undermine the value that citizenship has, because it creates certain very basic guarantees that are available to everyone.

And now this would change and you'd have two classes of citizens. Those who are born here and those who are not. Of course, everybody, citizen or not, is subject to the criminal law. And if you commit a terrible crime, you should go to prison for a long time. But that doesn't mean that you lose your citizenship, and it shouldn't turn on something as accidental on where you were born, in my view.

That such that consequence would flow to one side of those people and not the other. The other thing where I think we really disagree is on the threat about selective enforcement and the idea that the administration would use the denaturalization power, if it were greatly expanded, to go after its enemies, to go after people from disfavored racial groups.

Sadly we have seen this administration do exactly that and it's used, excuse me, it's used the deportation power to do that, to go after people whose political views they didn't like when it came to Palestine. And actually, other political issues. To go after people who are engaged in advocating for the rights of immigrants. And of course, we've seen so much race discrimination from this administration just all across the board. So it's easy to imagine that this power would be used in the same kinds of ways, and that could lead to a lot more abuse as well.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. I wanna talk about now about how the Trump administration is seeking to expand the number of denaturalization cases it may pursue. Professor, hang on here for a second because to do that I wanna bring in Irina Manta. She's a law professor at Hofstra University. Professor Manta, welcome.

IRINA MANTA: Thank you so much. Thanks for having me.

CHAKRABARTI: I'm having unfortunately tough time with names today. I should say Professor Manta, forgive me.

MANTA: No worries.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, let's talk in more detail about what the Justice Department memo says about how and when they might seek denaturalization cases in federal court.

If both of you can just bear with me for a moment, I want to read through the list or an abridged list of the 10 types of crimes or instances where denaturalization would be pursued. The first is the one we've already talked about, individuals who pose a danger to national security, being parts of terrorist organizations, committing espionage against the United States, et cetera.

Then there's number two, cases against individuals who engage in torture war crimes. Also, still a longstanding area where you could get denaturalized. Then there's cases against individuals who further or furthered unlawful enterprise of criminal gangs or transnational criminal organizations or drug cartels.

Then another, number four is individuals who commit felonies that were not disclosed during the naturalization process, then there's individuals who committed human trafficking, sex offenses, or violent crimes. Then there's cases against individuals who engaged in forms of fraud against the United States, including the paycheck protection program or loan fraud.

Then cases against individuals who engaged in fraud against private individuals, funds or corporations. You could also be denaturalized if you acquired your naturalization through government corruption or fraud. There are cases that could be referred by a U.S. attorney's office in connection with pending criminal charges, but don't fit in the other categories I just read.

And then finally, number 10, the Justice Department could pursue denaturalization in cases referred to the civil division that the division determines sufficient and important to pursue. How much broader is that suite of 10 points? How much broader is that than what we have now in terms of when the federal government would try to denaturalize a U.S. citizen?

Professor Manta. Yeah, go ahead.

MANTA: I would say that one of the things that's very concerning about this list that's on the fourth page of that memo is that it's basically saying we're going to do things that are available under the current law, but then when it lists them, and here, I want to echo what Ahilan was saying earlier.

It doesn't actually explain, I think that's intentional, what the timing is of those offenses. Are we talking about things that happened before the person was naturalized? In which case, why do we have so many categories? Why isn't it just things that were not disclosed? Because presumably, if they were disclosed, it doesn't really make sense, like because the person wouldn't have gotten naturalized if it's one of these, let's say terrorism and all these different things.

And so I think here we have to go back to this idea that the administration at times is talking in a coded manner, like what you were talking about with the DEI term, that's a form of dog whistle in my view. And here this ambiguity is also, actually, I think trying to hint at the fact that they are going to expand things, that they are going to go beyond what statutory law would allow, and beyond what other administrations have done previously, and that it's going to try to go after everything and everyone in every possible way, including as Ahilan was pointing out, in ways that are harassing.

So I find the ambiguity and among other things of this memo very disconcerting. I don't trust it at all. Also, if we look at how other immigration matters have been handled this year by the federal government, including in unlawful ways, I'm very concerned.

CHAKRABARTI: In fact, from Ms. Ries at the Heritage Foundation a couple of minutes ago. We heard that one of the goals here is to make people think twice, right? About becoming naturalized citizens. And she was saying like that would effectively, the chilling effect would potentially reduce the number of people who they believe are dangerous to the United States from trying to become citizens. Professor Manta.

MANTA: Yes, I am getting that sense now. The memo, I'm afraid, goes even further than that. He's talking about things that are happening after naturalization. But absolutely there are any number of chilling effects that are in place here. One of them is the one that you mentioned, of just discouraging people from becoming citizens in the first place.

But another one is to basically get people to not express opinions that might not be pleasant to the current administration. People are afraid of ending up on the government's radar right now, even if they did nothing wrong. Even if they did nothing illegal, there was nothing wrong with the way that they went about immigrating and naturalizing.

But they don't want to end up in the cross hairs or have to go through some massive legal process. And if it's done on a civil basis, they might have to pay for their own lawyer. And so this is all could get very unpleasant. And so many people right now who are immigrants feel like, you know what?

I just better stay quiet, not get involved, not lead a political life. And that is not good for the United States.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Okay. Professor Arulanantham, let me just get some more clarity here. Because when we are speaking about the law, it can get somewhat opaque and definitely confusing. But now that we have that list of the 10 points or 10 areas in which the DOJ might want to seek denaturalization, just to check. If a U.S. citizen who is born in this country commits fraud against a private individual.

Or let's say engaged, allegedly engaged in fraud against the paycheck protection program or allegedly helped out a drug cartel. If a domestically born U.S. citizen committed any of those things, could they lose their citizenship?

ARULANANTHAM: No. No. Plain and simple, no.

CHAKRABARTI: And so that's the difference here. A difference, but go ahead.

ARULANANTHAM: I think and I'm sorry that lawyers are always trying to, being opaque but if a person is naturalized and after they're naturalized, they commit one of those same offenses that you're talking about, they cannot be stripped of their citizenship either.

And then that's why I think this memo is really trying to scare people by being ambiguous about that question. Now, if you commit a crime like that before you apply for citizenship, but it somehow doesn't come up in the interview or in your application and you fail to write that question, write that you were convicted on that basis, but you get naturalized anyway.

That mistake, that could be the basis, being denaturalized, but that mistake doesn't happen, right? Or must be extraordinary.

CHAKRABARTI: But what you're saying is that record the memo makes is quite fuzzy about whether they're talking about before or after someone becomes a U.S. citizen. So we're going to pick up on that thought when we come back.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Manta. Let me just ask you something about the limits of executive power in this case, because we talked, we've talked about multiple times. No, the president can't do this. President can't denaturalize more people just willy-nilly, or the expanded basis of denaturalization as determined by the Justice Department, not really practicable in an actual federal court, but I do wonder about that. Because aren't we talking about policies that are within the power of the executive to expand? As far as I know, the basis for denaturalization, beyond the you committed treason stuff.

It's not necessarily in the Constitution. I think that the Justice Department could in fact pursue more of these cases. Is that correct or no?

MANTA: The Department of Justice technically can do all sorts of things. Whether those things are legal and ethical is a different question. And same with whether the president directs them to do things that may or may not be legal and ethical.

So it's a matter of whether it's legitimate or not for them to do, and I don't think it is, and I think the courts will hopefully largely stop them. Now, who knows? They might also select carefully where they file their cases, which is another problem, right? If they look for specific judges that might have friendlier views toward this.

And you can game this a little bit more in some courts than others, what judge you get. But so it's not supposed to. Now, look we have precedents in history for when governments in the early 20th century used the power of denaturalization to basically go after certain, like, ethnic groups or go after people whose views it didn't agree with.

But then, the Supreme Court did push back ultimately against that. And then starting in the late '60s, this really slowed down. And it became much more just about, okay, was there fraud in the denaturalization process? And so part of that was the realization that the United States should not be like other countries that are totalitarian in nature.

And Soviet Union, et cetera, at the time, and that are more long, papers place type countries. And it's very frightening to see us now come back to that and basically unwind some of these things that have been recognized as no longer being acceptable.

So in that sense, it's a return to older history, except there is no legal precedent that should, to some extent, stand in the way of doing so.

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Arulanantham, would you like to add to that?

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah, I agree with what Professor Manta says. I think I would just add that currently the basis for denaturalization are written in federal laws that Congress has enacted. And the Supreme Court has construed those laws narrowly as we've both been saying pretty recently. The case I mentioned at the top of the show about the Bosnian Serb women who was not, she won in the Supreme Court. That was from 2017. And the prior case interpreting similar rules saying that you have to, the fraud has to be material. That is, it has to be something that would've caused you to lose, to not be eligible for naturalization. That was written by Justice Scalia.

So it could change. The Supreme Court has done all kinds of radical shifts in its doctrine in the recent past to conform to what the Trump administration wants to do. But this would be a very radical shift, and it would have to happen very fast in order for the legal system to accommodate some kind of mass denaturalization.

CHAKRABARTI: I'm thinking back to the fact that there have been so few cases in the past for a successful prosecution for denaturalization. And I wonder what happens to those people who are stripped of their citizenship? Where do they go if they're not dual citizens?

ARULANANTHAM: In the cases that I'm aware of, the government then seeks to deport the person.

And I'm aware of a handful of cases that came after, in the years after 9/11 when there were prosecuting in the sort of terrorism related context. And the ones I know about, people were sent back to countries that they had come from, many years ago, before they became U.S. citizens.

And those were criminal cases where the denaturalization was part of the criminal process because the person made a statement, like we talked about, had made a statement that was fraudulent and that would've rendered them ineligible for naturalization. So that's the ones that I'm aware of.

CHAKRABARTI: I don't know if Professor Manta, other information about what happens in those cases, but for me, from what I'm aware of, it leads to deportation.

MANTA: And some of them, the first step that happens is that people revert back to their previous status, which is normally a green card.

And so there still needs to be a process to actually do that deportation. And indeed, and in some cases, that's what happened. They just get sent back to usually wherever they came from originally. But some of them also stay here either because the government doesn't bother going after them or because they do it in such a way that fails.

For example, in the case of Baljinder Singh there was a drug offense committed during the time period that Singh was a citizen and before he was denaturalized, and the court there said, look, you can't deport him on the basis of that crime because he was not an alien at the time of that crime.

So this is just one example to show that it can actually get tricky to deport someone. Even once there has been an offense, you need another process. And that process may or may not work depending on whether you follow the statutory requirements accordingly. But I want to emphasize one point, which is that even though we're talking about a relatively small number of cases, this is really intended to scare people. And even a small number of cases can do that. And a couple of loud memos that say we're going to go after this whole laundry list of things. Again, some of these concepts being vaguer than others. And I think we can't get hung up on the fact that the number is small, even if the number, let's say, remains small next year, this is having an effect.

And if you speak with immigrants to the United States, you will see that they are changing the way that they live their lives and they express themselves out of fear.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Can, let's talk for another minute about the Singh case that you just brought up Professor Manta, because you said that before he was stripped of his denaturalization, he couldn't, obviously could not be, excuse me. Before he was stripped of his citizenship, he could not be deported, but he ended up getting denaturalized. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? Because I understand that this was also part of a first Trump administration effort called Operation Janus.

MANTA: Yeah, this was the first big Operation Janus case, so where the Trump administration digitized a bunch of records and to go after people that may have used the different names at different stages.

Singh's case is very, it's very strange in a sense, and very messy in a sense that there were two applications that he filed originally. To remain in the United States under two different names, but it's not obvious why. Because it's not like the first one was denied. It's just that something happened there procedurally where he may have not shown up at a hearing and so he files it again.

Ultimately Singh ends up getting citizenship in the United States, and he ends up getting denaturalized, as you said, because of this Operation Janus activity. And then after that, right after all that, it turns out that at some point he engaged in, it was like conspiracy to distribute MDMA and some other drugs, but during the period that he was a citizen.

And so Court of Appeals said in 2021, which is the last official record that I'm personally aware of. Alright, you can't do that. Like you can't get rid of him on that basis. And so the government probably thought that would be the easiest and then turned out to be wrong. And then, after that, like who knows what happened, whether they just give up or whether they're still at it. But this case was just one of these cases that stuck out because you had the denaturalization that was originally done in absentia. And there are a number of procedural problems with civil denaturalization as opposed to criminal denaturalization.

CHAKRABARTI: ... Yeah, I do wanna, actually, that's really very important. And I want to follow up on that, but I need to correct myself. Because I made an error in saying that Operation Janus was started in the first Trump administration. That is incorrect. I now have the proper date in front of me.

It was started in 2010, which would've been the Obama administration. And then it was launched, quote, to continue the work and expand the Department of Homeland Security efforts to identify individuals with a final deportation order who naturalized or obtained legal permanent resident status under a different identity. So it dates back 15 years now. But Professor Manta, I was going to ask both of you, and I'll just stick with you for a second. The difference between criminal denaturalization cases and civil ones, because the Department of Justice memo from this summer, I believe it focuses on civil denaturalization.

So talk about that.

MANTA: Yeah. So this is a very important distinction. Criminal denaturalization, while it sounds scarier, and in some sense, it is. Because you could also end up with actual criminal sanctions on top of being denaturalized, is something that is limited to the 10 years after you obtained naturalization.

So that's the statute of limitations. The government can only go after you during that time. And it also being a criminal proceeding comes with certain kinds of rights like a right to having a lawyer provided to you to a jury and so on, where civil denaturalization, and this is really one of the issues we're dealing with here.

It is endless. The government could show up dozens of years after somebody has become a citizen and say that person committed some kind of offense during their naturalization process. And we've decided we're going to go after them only now. And as my co-author, Cassandra Robertson and I have written about, there is a very strong interest in finality in the legal system generally, but specifically when it comes to naturalization.

Is there a point where we can say, you are now a citizen. You are now basically like everybody else. We don't have two classes of citizenship or not. And so you combine this door that was technically left open by maintaining this civil denaturalization process. With an administration that is potentially actively going after people that it doesn't like for ideological or racial or other reasons, and that becomes extremely dangerous and really divides America.

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Arulanantham, do you want to add to that?

ARULANANTHAM: Only that I think you could imagine a court that looked at that set of rules and said, we obviously should have a right to appointed counsel given how significant a deprivation it would be to take somebody's citizenship away. And similarly, a court that said it's not fair.

30, 40 years after the fact, it should be settled. There should be a statute of limitations in civil denaturalization proceedings. Unfortunately, I don't think this court is the one that you'd expect to make a ruling like that, but if we want a system of fair, orderly justice, I think those would be basic requirements that ought to be imposed.

CHAKRABARTI: Professor, you still there?

MANTA: Which one of us? (LAUGHS)

CHAKRABARTI: I've got multiple to choose from. I was trying to see if Ahilan is still there, but it looks like --

ARULANANTHAM: Yes, that's, I just wanted say, yeah, I think those are rules that ought to be in place.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Let me ask you both about one more thing, and that's the final the point number 10 in the DOJ memo, because it's the one that seems the broadest, that basically it's like we may pursue denaturalization against you at your 30, 40 years, even after you become a citizen.

If we just perceive you as being a threat or a potential danger to national security, I'm not sure how much broader you can be in terms of who could be targeted for denaturalization. And Ahilan, I'll just stick with you for a second and give Irina the last word there.

So it seems as if then, this could be a threat to people forever and essentially if indeed be the administration behaves this way, we will have a sort of two tier citizenship.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah, I definitely think that's what the government intends in making this, in writing this.

But I think it's really important to be appropriately concerned, but also not to be overly concerned. And that's true of so many things in the Trump administration. And I think here the critical point is, this is a memo that is describing who they want to prioritize for denaturalization, like who do they wanna investigate? Who do they want to try to get at? But of course, the person still has to be subject to it. Like the law still has to require that they're not actually entitled to citizenship. If they go through every case of every person with a crime or maybe only certain nationalities, people with a crime, they can look and look.

But what they're gonna find if they go through thousands of those cases, is that only a vanishingly small number of them are actually subject to denaturalization. And so I think it's, like I said, it's important to be worried. I think a memo that creates prioritization like that to the threat of selective enforcement and targeting people for their political views is wrong, and that should be denounced.

But I don't think it's going to lead to thousands and thousands of denaturalizations. Because they can look all they want. They can look and look, but they're not gonna find very many people who are actually, the law would allow them to lose their citizenship.

“The European Convention on Human Rights provides the framework we need to address these issues effectively and responsibly.","At a Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg on Wednesday, justice ministers from the organisation's 46 member states defended the need to revamp the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for the modern age.

It came six months after nine countries – including Italy, Denmark, Poland and Belgium – published a letter criticising the ECHR for setting ""too many limits"" on their power to expel people from their territories.

The 46 nations will now work towards adopting a ""political declaration"" on the issue of migration at a summit next May.

Alain Berset, secretary-general of the Council of Europe, which oversees the convention, said signatory countries were not calling for the treaty itself to be rewritten.

""It was the start of a process, on a consensus basis, because it is the only way to make some progress,"" he told reporters after Wednesday's meeting.

Migration issues 'high on agenda'

The talks took place as Europe continues to tighten migration policy.

In early December, European Union member states agreed to make deportations easier and to expand the processing of asylum seekers outside Europe.

In recent years, the link between the European Convention on Human Rights and national measures to control migration has become the subject of intense political debate in many Council of Europe states.

“Migration issues are high on the agenda of countries and people across Europe,” said Berset ahead of the meeting.

“The European Convention on Human Rights provides the framework we need to address these issues effectively and responsibly. Our task is not to weaken the convention, but to keep it strong and relevant – to ensure that liberty and security, justice and responsibility, are held in balance.”

According to various sources cited by legal analysts, between 15 and 20 states now back the initiative launched by Denmark and Italy to narrow how parts of the convention are applied in migration cases.

Some governments have gone further. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has threatened to denounce the convention if a ruling expected in early 2026 on Polish pushbacks of migrants goes against his government.

EU pushes ahead with overhaul of migration rules as ‘return hubs’ approved

Push for reform

The debate centres on two key articles of the convention often used by those challenging deportation orders. Article 3 bans torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Article 8 protects the right to respect for private and family life.

Belgian jurist Marc Bossuyt, a former president of Belgium's constitutional court and a critic of the ECHR’s approach to migration, told French daily Le Monde that governments are “fed up with the interpretation of the Strasbourg court”.

He said he believes in these instruments and the rule of law, but argued that “international treaties established long ago must be applied in current circumstances”.

Bossuyt said the ECHR's reading of Article 3 goes too far by not only banning torture but also requiring states to provide a “decent asylum procedure” and “decent reception” for asylum seekers, which he argues falls outside the article.

He also called for a more restrictive reading of Article 8, warning that as long as the court in Strasbourg interprets it broadly, “it is normal that national judges follow it”.

In the UK, the debate has seen calls by the right-wing Conservative Party and anti-immigration Reform UK to quit the convention.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the left-wing Labour Party, has instead pushed for reform from within.

In a joint article with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, he argued that the convention should be updated to deal with “mass mobility” and said that “listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about”.

British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has already announced plans to curb the use of Article 8 in deportation appeals and to reassess how Article 3 is applied. She said the definition of these rights “has reached the heights of absurdity”.

“Today we try to deport criminals, but we find it is impossible because the prisons in their home countries have cells deemed too small, or even mental health services less effective than ours,” she said.

Under pressure? EU states on edge over migrant redistribution plan

Warnings from legal experts

Many legal scholars reject the claim that the court is blocking migration control. Strasbourg law professor Peggy Ducoulombier told Le Monde that in 10 years, immigration cases made up less than 2 percent of the court's 420,000 applications and that more than 90 percent were rejected as inadmissible or because there was no violation.

“One can disagree with a ruling, but this system protects all of us,” she said. “We have a lot to lose by weakening it.”

Céline Romainville, a law professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, said many attacks on the court “blow up one ruling without putting it in context” and do not take into account the full body of case law.

Officials at the Council of Europe and legal commentators say states are now working towards an interpretative declaration on migration and the convention, to be agreed by 2026, which would give political guidance to the court on how to apply the treaty.",https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/271d6cce-d5cc-11f0-9f7b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-66D79TK.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:59:55.484880

The elder Mavalwalla said many of the people he meets in conservative eastern Washington state believe the government has over-reached.

After pleading guilty to conspiracy, Stuckart invoked the memory of Martin Luther King, who was arrested 29 times, often in acts of civil disobedience.
“I cannot think of an instance where the FBI arrested Dr King for conspiracy,” he said.","An Afghanistan war veteran arrested on felony “conspiracy” charges a month after he participated in a protest against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) maintains his innocence and is preparing for a jury trial, even as others arrested the same day strike plea agreements to avoid long prison terms, his father said.

Bajun Mavalwalla II – a former army sergeant who survived a roadside bomb blast on a special operations mission in Afghanistan – was charged in July with “conspiracy to impede or injure officers” after joining an anti-ICE protest in Spokane, Washington.

Legal experts have said the case marks an escalation in the Trump administration’s attacks on first amendment rights. Veterans’ groups have decried the charges as “un-American”.

“My son is innocent,” said his father, Bajun Ray Mavalwalla, a retired US army intelligence officer with three Bronze stars earned during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The elder Mavalwalla said many of the people he meets in conservative eastern Washington state believe the government has over-reached. He launched an exploratory committee to challenge Spokane’s Republican representative Michael Baumgartner this fall after the Guardian featured his son’s arrest, drawing national attention to the case.

At the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, people say “‘Oh my God! This is an incredible injustice,’” Mavalwalla said. “‘Your son is a hero. He served his country. FBI agents should be out catching bank robbers and human traffickers. To use these agents to handcuff a veteran who was protesting is just ridiculous and a violation of constitutional rights … ‘”

The protest turned confrontational, leaving a government van’s windshield smashed and tires slashed, but Mavalwalla was not among the more than two dozen people arrested at the scene. More than a month passed before the FBI arrived at his door on 15 July.

Ben Stuckart, the former president of the Spokane city council, called for the protest, declaring in a Facebook post that he intended to physically block the transport of two Venezuelan immigrants who were in the country legally when they were arrested by ICE.

On Monday, Stuckart pleaded guilty to a felony conspiracy charge, avoiding the maximum sentence of six years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.

Instead, under an agreement reached with federal prosecutors, he was sentenced to 18 months supervised release with a promise to reduce the charges to a misdemeanor if there are no additional violations.

“Situations like this are happening all across the country,” Stuckart said of the arrest of the Venezuelan immigrants, who eventually opted to self-deport after sustained incarceration.

“At the time, it was my hope that the government would do the right thing and release them from custody. I understood what I was up against, but I felt it was necessary to take a stand. I accept full responsibility for my conduct,” he said.

Court records show prosecutors have now reached plea agreements with four of the nine individuals arrested for conspiracy after the demonstration in Spokane. Observers believe all but Mavawalla will strike deals to avoid prison. Representatives of the US attorney’s office in Spokane did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In continuing to contest the charges, Mavalwalla faces the same potential penalties Stuckart did: six years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.

The indictments were handed down two days after career prosecutor Richard Barker, the acting US attorney for eastern Washington state, resigned. In a social post, Barker wrote: “I am grateful that I never had to sign an indictment or file a brief that I didn’t believe in.”

In August, Donald Trump nominated Pete Serrano, a former litigator for the Silent Majority Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, to head the office, while also installing him in an interim capacity. Serrano has no prosecutorial experience and has described the January 6 US Capitol rioters as “political prisoners”.

After pleading guilty to conspiracy, Stuckart invoked the memory of Martin Luther King, who was arrested 29 times, often in acts of civil disobedience.

King “explained that the antidote to fear is courage”, Stuckart said at sentencing: “We must be courageous, while accepting the consequences for our actions. And we must never stop fighting for each other.”

Clayborne Carson, a professor emeritus of history and director of the Martin Luther King Jr Papers Project at Stanford University, said that the FBI’s arrest of Mavalwalla and his co-defendants represented an escalation from the agency’s activities during the civil rights era.

“The FBI spied on Dr King. They spied on me,” he said. “There was even a file that said I had been ‘seen at the beach’.” But back then, Carson said, the FBI was seen as an ‘investigative agency’, not as one that would swoop in and put an activist in handcuffs.

“I cannot think of an instance where the FBI arrested Dr King for conspiracy,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff9b4a76638017d8072ccb96bde98c912d5c1921/143_0_1338_1070/master/1338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e11a36784e80212c20bcec42d9d8d224",N,,2025-12-11 10:57:10.921386

Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks.","“When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price. Units miss critical training that prepares them for combat, pilots and crews lose valuable flight hours, and dollars are spent on wasteful walls instead of family housing,” said Congressman Garamendi. “As this report shows, these disruptions come at a significant cost, in both dollars and readiness. In addition to costing the DoD up to three times more than it would cost DHS for the same operations, our military has to pay the bill. Diverting over $2 billion in funds siphons money away from training, modernization, and maintenance: core investments that should support military families and prepare our forces to fight and win.”

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts in support of DHS with money allocated for other DoD projects(link is external) including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) co-authored the report.

The members’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” said the members.

“The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” wrote the members. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border(link is external) instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was(link is external) “understaffed because roughly half its members [were] deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred(link is external) during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding(link is external) from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse(link is external) among service members and may have even contributed(link is external) to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

“The report also slammed the administration’s failure to adequately inform Congress and the public about the diversion of funds. “The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” said the members.",https://garamendi.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-11 10:56:47.516331

It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump's signature policy area, Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.

In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem’s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.

The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.

Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.

The secretary's appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador.

Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. Homeland Security says agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations do not target or arrest American citizens for immigration reasons although they say they have arrested Americans for allegedly interfering in enforcement operations.

And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

Also attending Thursday’s hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.

Previous hearings have included questions on cybersecurity, China, chemical security and drones. Under President Joe Biden, at times of heavy migration at the southern border, Republicans often focused their questioning on his Democratic administration's handling of border security.

Full Release

LOREAUVILLE, La., Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII (NYSE: HII) executives toured Breaux Brothers Enterprises in Loreauville, Louisiana, and announced that construction of a prototype of ROMULUS, the company’s new unmanned surface vessel (USV) family, has reached 30% completion. The vessel remains on schedule for sea trials in the fourth quarter of 2026.

During the visit, HII leaders toured the shipyard with build partners Breaux Brothers and Incat Crowther, and reviewed progress on hull construction, integration of the HII’s Odyssey Autonomous Control System (ACS), and outfitting work.

“ROMULUS is progressing at a pace that reflects the urgency of the mission and the strength of our partnerships,” said Andy Green, president of HII’s Mission Technologies division. “Breaux Brothers and our industry team are delivering a platform that brings scale, autonomy and real operational advantage to the fleet. At 30% complete, the ROMULUS prototype is well on its way to becoming the benchmark for unmanned surface capability.”

ROMULUS USVs are designed to meet the current and emerging requirements of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, joint forces and allies. They deliver high-endurance, sustained open-ocean autonomy with a focus on lethality, cost efficiency and scalability.

The family of USVs will support missions including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, counter-unmanned air systems, mine countermeasures, strike, and the launch and recovery of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

An image and video accompanying this release are available at: http://hii.com/news/hii-announces-major-milestone-for-romulus-usv-technology/ .

Paired with HII’s REMUS UUVs, ROMULUS extends undersea reach and supports a scalable dual-domain force package built for distributed maritime operations.

This ROMULUS prototype is the first in HII’s modular, AI-enabled ROMULUS USV line. The ships are engineered for rapid, repeatable production and high endurance at sea. With speeds over 25 knots and a range of 2,500 nautical miles, all ROMULUS USVs are designed for mission flexibility across global theaters.

ROMULUS is built around Odyssey ACS, HII’s proven autonomy suite used across more than 35 USV platforms and over 750 REMUS UUVs in 30 countries. Odyssey enables sustained open-ocean autonomy, multi-agent swarming, modular payload integration, and manned-unmanned teaming. ROMULUS platforms will also feature integrated capabilities from Shield AI, Applied Intuition, and C3 AI for enhanced autonomous performance and lifecycle sustainment.

The Odyssey software suite’s open-access, government-aligned architecture enables rapid integration of new sensors, payloads and third-party autonomy technologies. It allows industry, government and academia to test and refine capabilities, ensuring ROMULUS evolves in step with emerging naval concepts of operations.

In November, HII and Shield AI announced that they have successfully completed the first major test of their integrated autonomy solution aboard HII’s ROMULUS 20 USV, marking a key step toward operational deployment of the AI-enabled ROMULUS fleet.

ROMULUS is being developed with support from HII’s Dark Sea Labs Advanced Technology Group.

Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1050% increase in assaults against them and 8000% increase in death threats.
“I absolutely would characterize ICE as secret police, and it is absolutely imperative that we abolish ICE,” she told HuffPost.","There was a time when calling for the dismantling of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was considered too risky for a Democrat to campaign on.

But today, images of aggressive immigration arrests in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, have led to anti-ICE sentiment creeping back into the party’s messaging.

“Let me be clear: F--- ICE,” Patty Garcia, who is running for Congress in Illinois’ 4th Congressional District, said when she launched her bid. “It’s time to abolish ICE and hold Trump and his entire clan accountable.”

In Maine, Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner — in what’s shaping up to be one of the highest profile races in the nation — vowed to hold ICE agents responsible and “make them take their masks off” if Democrats gained power in the midterms.

“Organizations that are used to kidnap Americans are not organizations that should exist in the future,” Platner said at a town hall last month. “We need to have public hearings … frankly, probably trials down the road. Because the American people deserve to know what the hell is going on right now and how the people doing it can justify it to themselves.”

In New York, a 25-year-old survivor of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is making his first congressional bid on a platform that includes a call to abolish ICE.

“An organization that can be turned into the President’s fascist secret police in a matter of months cannot be reformed, only dismantled,” Cameron Kasky, a candidate for New York’s 12th Congressional District, states on his website.

All of the brazen talk by some Democrats comes as President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown increasingly draws political backlash at the ballot box, in polling and even among some in his own party. In most cases, Democrats have held back from calling for the outright abolition of ICE and instead are pushing for transparency, oversight or restricting local and state government cooperation with federal immigration officials.

There’s a difference today from how Democrats messaged the issue in 2018, when the “Abolish ICE” movement swept across the progressive end of the party. Many Democrats are now calling for an end to what they’ve coined “secret police,” saying they’re carrying out “kidnappings.” Most emphasize the need for a secure border and support deportations that target criminals, but they say today’s immigration efforts are shrouded in secrecy and lack accountability.

It represents a shift in how these Democrats plan to position themselves on one of the leading issues that swept Trump into office last year.

During Joe Biden’s presidency, public sentiment swung toward intensified border security and deportations after lax border enforcement led to an influx of migrant crossings. On the campaign trail last year, Trump portrayed his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris — whom Biden tasked with looking at the root causes of migration from Central America — as too soft on illegal immigration.

Trump’s relentless focus on immigration was cited in NBC exit polls as among the top issues among 2024 voters who supported him.

But since federal immigration agents have landed in cities across the country, public officials have sought ways to push back on Department of Homeland Security operations. The growing backlash is amplified by images of noncriminal undocumented immigrants being apprehended by masked federal agents, often aggressively. NBC News exit polling after the Nov. 4 elections showed Latino voters were concerned about Trump’s actions on immigration enforcement, with majorities of Latinos in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City saying the administration had gone too far. In New Jersey, municipalities that were at least 60% Latino that supported Trump or saw soft Democratic support in 2024 swung to Democrats by double digits.

While much of the rhetoric is targeted at ICE, the Border Patrol has taken a lead role in many of the deportation operations. Last month, immigration agents arrested a Chicago day care worker in front of students. In another instance, the targeting of an immigrant working on home construction in a residential neighborhood erupted into chaos, leading to a 2-year-old playing nearby to be exposed to tear gas.

“Everything has changed since Chicago. The images coming out of Chicago, the images coming out of Charlotte,” said Joe Calvello, senior adviser to Platner. “People across America I think are deeply disturbed by this. They view it as deeply un-American.”

“This is what Graham deeply believes, there needs to be accountability,” Calvello continued. “We need to unmask these people who are terrorizing not only our neighbors and community members, but American citizens.”

By contrast, Platner’s primary opponent in the Senate race, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, would not sign a bill prohibiting local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents.

In 2018, when Trump’s first administration faced fierce opposition for separating immigrant families, an anti-ICE movement emerged that many Democrats clung to nationally as a litmus test of sorts.

By 2020, however, as a crowded presidential primary was underway, some of their past statements involving the defunding of police or immigration agencies came back to haunt them. That included Harris, who had at one point in 2018 said that, with regard to ICE, “we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.” While Harris had also said that immigration agencies had a role to play, opponents often portrayed her as having moved too far to the left.

Calls for an outright elimination of ICE are still less common today than they were in 2018. At the same time, Democrats across the country are seeking ways through legislation and resolutions to strip the agency of some of its core functions or impose strict accountability measures. In September, California passed the No Secret Police Act and other legislation that bans ICE and other law enforcement from wearing masks or face coverings during enforcement and to display visible IDs. Similar efforts are underway in New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

A DHS official said it all comes at a cost, however.

“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences. Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1050% increase in assaults against them and 8000% increase in death threats. The men and women at ICE and CBP and all of our federal law enforcement agencies put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens to protect and defend the lives of American citizens. Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization,” Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement.

“Our law enforcement officers are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, we just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

DHS has often cited elevated threats against law enforcement but has not provided supporting data.

The 2018 anti-ICE movement was in part expanded after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used it as a central tenet in her stunning upset win over an entrenched New York Democratic congressman.

Since Trump took office in January, she’s reasserted that position, tangling with his administration to the point that his border czar, Tom Homan, threatened “maybe she’s gonna be in trouble.”

In May, she reiterated her support for ICE’s elimination and recently has held “know your rights” sessions in her district with immigrants who might be targeted for deportation. The White House seemed so certain that this was a losing issue, it posted a whole article on Ocasio-Cortez’s call for the elimination of ICE on its official web page.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., introduced legislation that would ban ICE from detaining or deporting U.S. citizens. A ProPublica investigation found more than 170 instances of citizens held by immigration officials. In an interview, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said he wants to use Congress’ purse strings to demand more oversight of DHS, which Republicans have infused with billions of dollars in additional funding.

Today, at least some Democrats feel they are on far safer ground as even the president’s allies are questioning administration tactics. Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., told NBC News that the recent off-year elections should be a “wake-up call for the GOP.” In those races, notably for the governors’ seats in New Jersey and Virginia, Republicans lost by wider margins than expected, and Hispanic Latino voters with whom Trump made record gains in 2024 swung back to Democrats.

In addition, roughly a half-dozen Republicans in Congress said the administration needed to rethink some aspects of its immigration crackdown, including the sweeping nature of Trump’s immigration push, according to a review of public statements by NBC News.

The administration needs “a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said in an October podcast interview, as she broke with the administration on the issue, expressing concerns about the effect of removing a portion of the workforce.

Other high-profile condemnations of the treatment of immigrants have grown louder, from country music star Zach Bryan to Pope Leo XIV. Most recently, the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, which has long supported immigration rights, took a rare step and for the first time in 13 years issued a special message denouncing the administration’s actions.

It is amid that backdrop that Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., called not just for ICE’s elimination, but argued from the House floor last week that DHS should be eliminated as an agency, perhaps shifting some functions elsewhere.

“We brought DHS into this world less than 25 years ago. We can build a world without it as well,” she said.

In an interview, Ramirez said that now, federal agents are acting without constraints and were unwilling to be accountable to anyone but Trump.

“The tides are turning and the American people are seeing ICE as one of the biggest threats to democracy itself,” Ramirez said. “It’s a contradiction to what this agency was created to be,” Ramirez said. “They are terrorizing communities across the city, and you’ve seen this across the country.”

In the race to succeed retiring Rep. Jan Schakowsky in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, top-polling contenders Kat Abughazaleh and Daniel Biss have both called for ICE to be abolished.

Abughazaleh wasn’t just a frequent presence in protests at an immigrant processing facility that became ground zero for pushback on the deportation efforts; she was indicted after she was accused of impeding a government vehicle from moving forward.

“I absolutely would characterize ICE as secret police, and it is absolutely imperative that we abolish ICE,” she told HuffPost.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat and a potential 2028 White House contender, has served as a national foil to Trump on the immigration issue, repeatedly holding up examples of overreach.

In an interview, Pritzker also said that some form of border patrol must always exist and that in past administrations, ICE had operated within its jurisdiction.

“We need secure borders,” he said. “You don’t have a country unless you have a secure border.”

Pritzker, though, focused on Trump’s role in steering ICE and CBP from having gone “way beyond the mission that they were founded for.”

“This president has essentially authorized them and provided them immunity for going after people who have committed what is, by law, a misdemeanor,” Pritzker said. “He’s essentially treating those people like they’re the worst of the worst, and they’re choosing to be cruel and to dehumanize people.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251125-chicago-immigration-arrests-mn-1400-d69128.jpg",N,,2025-12-11 09:58:32.238700

With Congress set to leave for the holidays next week and the two sides still far apart on their approach to rising health insurance costs, time was nearly out to renew the premium subsidies, causing a sharp increase in costs for millions of Americans who buy coverage on the federal health care exchange. The stalemate is likely to figure as a central issue in the upcoming midterm election campaigns as Democrats see an opening to pound Republicans for failing to head off premium increases and threatening health care access.

Republicans said that the Democratic approach would simply maintain a “bloated” federal program that was meant to be temporary and is experiencing unsustainable costs. They said a new Government Accountability Office investigation also found the program is susceptible to fraud that has contributed to insurance company profits.

“The Democrat proposal, which is a three-year extension of the status quo, is an attempt to disguise the real impact of Obamacare’s spiraling health care costs,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader. “If we extend this three years at a cost of $83 billion to the taxpayers, what happens after three years?”

Democrats said that the Republican proposal amounted to an inadequate “coupon” for health care, noting that it would only go to those who purchased high-deductible insurance plans that require people to pay thousands of dollars for medical care before receiving coverage. They argued it would do nothing to head off the immediate threat of rising premiums.

“What Republicans have put forward is a not a health care plan,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. “It is a sick joke.”

Republicans had committed to allowing Democrats a vote on their proposal to extend the health care subsidies as a condition of a deal to end the government shutdown. The G.O.P. had considered not offering an alternative to the Democratic proposal, but party leaders faced pressure to put a plan forward so Republicans could say they had some alternative to allowing the tax subsidies to expire.

House Republicans say that next week they would begin considering some piecemeal measures that represent their approach to addressing rising health care costs, but an extension of the subsidies are so far not part of the mix. As a result, a group of House Republicans worried about the political backlash from allowing the subsidies to expire started a petition on Wednesday to try to force a floor vote.

The White House has taken a largely hands-off approach to the congressional health care fight. President Trump initially suggested he would back a limited extension of the subsidies but was quickly urged by Republicans on Capitol Hill to drop that push.

The European leaders are among officials from about 30 countries supporting Ukraine, known as the “coalition of the willing,” that are scheduled to talk by videoconference on Thursday with President Volodymyr Zelensky. A flurry of recent diplomatic efforts have failed to produce any breakthrough in negotiations to end the war, which started nearly four years ago when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Mr. Trump, who has expressed growing impatience with Ukraine and its European allies, did not provide details about what “pretty strong words” had been used on the call. He also said that the European leaders wanted to meet this weekend with Mr. Zelensky and American officials but that “we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with.”

“We don’t want to be wasting time,” Mr. Trump said. “Sometimes you have to let people fight it out.”

The president added that Mr. Zelensky had to be “realistic,” although he did not elaborate.

As it tries to negotiate peace on more favorable terms, Ukraine is also trying to secure long-term guarantees intended to deter future Russian aggression and a framework for economic cooperation to rebuild the country after the war.

Mr. Zelensky held talks with American officials and business leaders on Wednesday to discuss those rebuilding efforts. Attendees included the U.S. treasury secretary, Scott Bessent; Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law who has been involved in negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to end the war; and Larry Fink, chief executive of the BlackRock investment firm, who has previously been tapped to help coordinate investment to rebuild Ukraine after the war.

In a video address after his talks with the American officials and Mr. Fink, Mr. Zelensky cautioned that reconstruction would become possible only once the country was secure.

“When there is security,” he said, “everything else follows.”

Ukraine faces an increasingly tough battlefield as Russia tries to strengthen its position in negotiations by mounting offensives along the entire front line, with especially heavy fighting reported in the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

The Kremlin has insisted that Ukraine cede all of the eastern region of the country, known as the Donbas, a demand that Mr. Zelensky has rejected.

Russian forces are close to capturing Pokrovsk, a strategically important city in eastern Ukraine where the two sides have been fighting since July 2024. The city is largely under Russian control, though Ukrainian forces still hold parts of it.

A Ukrainian army corps responsible for operations in the area said in a social media post on Wednesday that Russian troops had begun an assault that morning under cover of rain and fog, trying to break into the city’s northern section with armored vehicles, cars and motorcycles. The Ukrainian military also released videos showing retaliatory drone strikes against Russian vehicles.

Overnight on Wednesday, Russia also targeted Ukraine infrastructure with 151 drones and three ballistic missiles, according to the Ukrainian authorities — the latest in a series of Russian bombardments that aim to harm the country’s energy grid. Ukraine also carried out overnight drone strikes on Russia.

In recent months, the federal government has mobilized the National Guard and deployed federal agents to several U.S. cities, primarily Democratic-led areas with large immigrant populations, against the wishes of local leaders. Trump administration officials have said those efforts were necessary to enforce immigration laws and reduce crime. But the operations have sometimes led to clashes between federal agents and residents who have criticized their use of force.

Federal officials have defended their use of tear gas and other crowd-control munitions against protesters in cities like Chicago, saying they had limited the measures to instances in which there was an immediate threat to agents.

The Department of Homeland Security has also made changes to the legal immigration system since last month’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., which left one dead. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan who received asylum in April, has been charged in the attack. Mr. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

Since then, the Trump administration has halted the ability of Afghans to obtain visas, paused decisions on asylum applications and vowed to review the more than 50,000 asylum applications that were approved during the Biden administration. It has also paused immigration applications submitted by foreign nationals from the 19 countries subject to the president’s travel ban.

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security have also said they would re-examine applications that were approved for migrants from those countries who entered the United States since the beginning of the Biden administration.

Those changes have already disrupted some immigrants’ applications for benefits. In recent days, immigration lawyers have said their clients have had their green card interviews or naturalization ceremonies canceled with little explanation.

In October, the administration significantly cut the number of refugees who are accepted and said it would give priority to mostly white Afrikaner South Africans. The Trump administration lowered the ceiling for refugee admissions to 7,500 for this fiscal year, down from the 125,000 cap the Biden administration set last year.

The measure includes an array of provisions that place Mr. Trump’s stamp on the U.S. military, including one that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the Defense Department. But to bring it up, House Republicans had to overcome resistance in their own ranks from hard-right members, some of whom said the measure, which seeks to block U.S. troops from withdrawing from Europe and would send new aid to Ukraine, abandoned the president’s “America First” promises.

The legislation also reflected growing frustration among members of both parties with the way Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has run the Pentagon, especially when it comes to the administration’s boat strikes in international waters, which have killed at least 87 people since September.

It would mandate that the Defense Department send Congress unedited videos that officials have so far been unwilling to show lawmakers of the maritime attacks, which Mr. Trump has said are being undertaken to target narco-terrorists trafficking drugs into the United States. And it would withhold 25 percent of Mr. Hegseth’s travel budget if he failed to give the congressional national security committees the video footage and the command orders behind the strikes.

The price tag for the bill came in $8 billion above what the Trump administration had requested, reflecting continued support in Congress for pouring huge sums into the military.

Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees said the bill would modernize and streamline the way the military buys weapons and supplies. White House officials argued in a statement that it would “strengthen the defense industrial base while eliminating funding for wasteful and radical programs.”

But the legislation also challenged parts of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

The bill would block the Pentagon from reducing the number of troops “permanently stationed in or deployed” to Europe below 76,000 for longer than 45 days, unless Mr. Hegseth and the top officer overseeing U.S. European Command certify to Congress that such a drawdown aligns with U.S. national security interests and that NATO allies were consulted.

And though Mr. Trump has pressed to end U.S. military support to Ukraine, the measure would authorize $400 million in annual security assistance for Kyiv for another two years. A handful of House Republicans, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, cited that provision in explaining their opposition to the bill.

“I would love to fund our military but refuse to support foreign aid and foreign militaries and foreign wars,” Ms. Greene wrote on social media.

Limiting the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe is at odds with recent moves by the Pentagon, which recently said it would cut U.S. troops in Germany, Romania and Poland, taking lawmakers by surprise. The provision also challenges the approach laid out in a new White House national security strategy that threatens to back European political parties “cultivating resistance” over longstanding U.S. allies in NATO countries.

Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a speech on the House floor that voting for the bill was an act of reasserting Congress’s authority as a coequal branch of government, “which is but one step along a very long road.” The legislation, he added, was an effort “to try to get some restraint on the lack of transparency, the unaccountability and the problems that are coming out of this White House and this Department of Defense.”

Democrats had pushed to include a change to the Defense Department’s health care plan to cover in vitro fertilization for troops and their family members. But for the second year in a row, Speaker Mike Johnson intervened during final negotiations to kill that provision. His opposition sprang from concerns that I.V.F. would lead to the destruction of embryos, a central critique of the treatment by conservatives.

The bill would also repeal Iraq and Persian Gulf War-era authorizations for the use of military force that presidents of both parties have used to justify military operations overseas without the consent of Congress, something Democrats and Republicans have long called for.

And it would roll back sweeping sanctions imposed on Syria’s construction, energy and financial sectors when former president Bashar al-Assad was in power. In the aftermath of the Assad regime and more than a decade of civil war in Syria, lawmakers in both parties have pressed to repeal the penalties to spur economic development there.

The House originally passed a bill loaded with conservative social policy mandates, including a ban on the Pentagon covering gender-affirming surgeries for troops. But that provision and several others were stripped out in final negotiations. The legislation still includes a ban on transgender women participating in women’s athletic programs at U.S. military academies.

Some aspects of the measure agreed upon during final talks were drawing harsh criticism on Wednesday, including one that originated in the House that would weaken safety measures around Ronald Reagan National Airport outside of Washington.

The bill would create a waiver to allow military aircraft to turn off enhanced tracking software while flying on national security missions through parts of the Washington airspace, or if the military determines that the flight poses no risk to commercial planes.

The legislation “fails to make the skies safer,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel’s top Democrat, said in a joint statement.

House Democrats also took issue with what they said was a last-minute addition to the bill that would expand the ability of federal agencies, and potentially local law enforcement, to monitor, intercept and disable drones that could pose a threat.

Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said the provision lacked “necessary guardrails,” and warned that it could “lead to major civil liberties violations.”

When asked about the ship’s oil, Mr. Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.” He declined to say who owned the tanker. “It was seized for a very good reason,” he added.

Three U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law enforcement operation, said the ship was carrying Venezuelan oil. They said there was no resistance from the crew and no casualties.

In a statement, Venezuela’s government called the seizure a “barefaced robbery and an act of international piracy” aimed at stripping the country of its oil wealth.

The operation was the latest tactic in an expanding effort to squeeze Venezuela and pressure Mr. Maduro. The Trump administration has accused him of running a “narcoterrorist” cartel sending drugs to the United States, although many current and former officials in Washington say the campaign is ultimately aimed at regime change.

Since September, the United States has launched more than 22 known strikes against boats in the region, killing more than 80 people. The Trump administration insists, without publicly providing evidence, that the boats are smuggling drugs. Legal experts say the strikes may violate international law.

Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a video on Wednesday evening on social media showing armed U.S. forces rappelling from a helicopter onto the deck of the tanker. The video could not be independently verified.

Ms. Bondi said the operation included the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard, supported by the Pentagon. She said the tanker had been used to transport “sanctioned oil” from Venezuela and Iran.

The U.S. officials said they expected additional seizures in the coming weeks as part of the administration’s efforts to weaken Mr. Maduro’s government by undermining its oil market.

One of the officials identified the tanker as a vessel called the Skipper, and said it was carrying Venezuelan oil from Petróleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company known as PDVSA. The official said the ship had been previously linked to the smuggling of Iranian oil — a global black market that the Justice Department has been investigating for years. The vessel was sailing under the flag of another Latin American nation in which it was not registered, the official said, and its ultimate destination was Asia.

A federal judge issued a seizure warrant roughly two weeks ago because of the ship’s past activities smuggling Iranian oil, not because of links to the Maduro government, the official said. Prosecutors have said that Iran uses money generated from oil sales to finance its military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the United States has designated a terrorist entity.

The administration did not address many details about the operation, including what happened to the crew and what ultimately will happen to the ship. It was not clear whether the seizure warrant — which is sealed — was for the ship or the oil or both. The White House did not immediately respond when asked whether the United States had the legal authority to keep the oil.

The ship, under a different name, had been put under sanctions by the Treasury Department in 2022. U.S. officials said it was part of “an international oil smuggling network that facilitated oil trades and generated revenue” to support Hezbollah and Iran’s revolutionary guard force.

The tanker may have been trying to conceal its whereabouts by broadcasting falsified location data before the seizure, according to an analysis of satellite imagery and photographs by The New York Times.

The Navy, the Coast Guard, Southern Command and the Pentagon all declined to discuss the episode, referring questions to the White House.

Venezuela is exceptionally dependent on oil, which makes these kinds of seizures potentially damaging to the country’s fragile economy. Oil accounts for the bulk of the country’s export revenues. In turn, Venezuela’s government spends much of the proceeds from oil exports to import basic necessities like food and medicine.

Although Venezuela is believed to have colossal untapped oil reserves, the country produces far less oil than it did at the start of the century, after mismanagement, U.S. sanctions and corruption at PDVSA hobbled output.

The United States was long the largest buyer of Venezuela’s oil, but political tensions have eroded those ties. China now buys roughly 80 percent of Venezuela’s overall oil exports.

Smaller amounts of Venezuelan oil are exported to the United States, often to refineries on the Gulf Coast, and to Cuba, where the island nation’s Communist leaders have long relied on such cargoes to provide a semblance of economic stability.

In recent months, Mr. Trump has ordered a huge buildup of U.S. forces in the region, with more than 15,000 troops and a dozen ships in the Caribbean, including the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Trump has authorized covert action against Venezuela and has warned that the United States could “very soon” expand its attacks from boats off the Venezuelan coast to targets inside the country. But Mr. Trump has also recently spoken by phone with Mr. Maduro about a possible meeting. The president said on Wednesday that he had not spoken to Mr. Maduro since their last conversation.

The administration has developed a range of options for military action in the country, including targeting Mr. Maduro and seizing control of the country’s oil fields. The president has repeatedly expressed reservations about an operation to remove Mr. Maduro from power, aides say, in part because of a fear that the operation could fail. Mr. Trump has been in no rush to make a decision, though he has shown a particular interest in extracting some of the value of Venezuela’s oil for the United States.

The oil tanker operation came on the same day the Nobel Peace Prize was formally bestowed on a Venezuelan dissident, María Corina Machado. She was not at the ceremony on Wednesday in Oslo, where her daughter received the prize on her behalf, but the Nobel Peace Prize committee said she had left Venezuela and was traveling to Oslo.

The Council of Europe met to discuss the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and migration, with its 46 member states backing plans to tackle concerns over addressing migration within the existing legal framework.

Law Society of England and Wales president, Mark Evans, said: “A fair society is one that protects us all and gives us the tools we need to enforce these protections. We all benefit when we can uphold the interests of everyone in our community and challenge government decisions that directly affect our lives.

“The ECHR is a vital part of these protections. It protects everyday rights, such as living our lives freely without unwarranted government interference or having public services that act for our common good. These rights have served us time and again.

“In times of global instability, our membership of the ECHR shows that we are a country that respects and upholds our international obligations, as well as the fundamental protections – protections we helped to define – that are set out in the Convention.

“The ECHR and the Council of Europe provide a foundation of shared values which enable us to work with other countries to navigate modern global challenges. Inter-state collaboration is vital to addressing these issues.

“We can address concerns about border controls without stripping people of their rights under ECHR. The Law Society strongly rejects calls to leave the ECHR.

“This process provides an opportunity for the UK government to show strong leadership. As the UK negotiates with its partners, we encourage it to do so based on clear evidence and with the purpose and values of the ECHR and the Council of Europe in mind.”",https://prdsitecore93.azureedge.net/-/media/web/project/tls-sites/the-law-society/logos/law-society-logo-green.svg?rev=a720b51104a64c9aac4bc135f03cf17a,N,,2025-12-11 12:00:01.086079

Prairie Band LLC, the tribe’s company, had landed a contract to assist in the design of detention centers for ICE.

The Kansas-based tribe announced the leadership changes Tuesday evening, just hours after the company’s president defended the decision to take the contract.

The tribe said the project does not align with its values.

“As a sovereign Nation, our values guide the decision we make,” the tribe said in the Facebook announcement, “and we acknowledge that this contract does not align with those principles.”

The tribe said it will reevaluate its internal review and approval process for taking on federal contracts. It also plans for all future agreements to “align clearly with our values and mission.”

However, it’s unclear the tribe will cancel the project. The announcement did not mention plans to nix the deal and officials for the tribe did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

“We recognize the weight this news carries for so many, as well as the feelings of anger, confusion and disappointment it caused,” the tribe said in the Facebook statement.

Jacob Wamego, Prairie Band LLC president, initially defended the contract, noting the company’s work mostly comes from federal contracts.

He told the Topeka Capital-Journal that the company would help with facility designs, but that he did not know where the facilities would be located.

The contract comes amid President Donald Trump’s campaign to remove people in the U.S. without full legal status. That effort has been hampered by a lack of detention space for tens of thousands of people facing possible deportation.

The federal government currently lists two immigration detention centers in Kansas — the Chase County Jail and the federal prison in Leavenworth.

Private prison company CoreCivic is attempting to reopen its facility in Leavenworth to house immigration detainees. But those plans have been delayed because of a legal dispute between the company and Leavenworth city leaders.

The impacts of the latest fight over Texas’ political maps are still reverberating around the state, but there are other debates on the horizon.

Future political representation could hinge on President Donald Trump’s renewed push to exclude at least some noncitizens from the population counts that help determine how political power is distributed in the U.S.

In Texas, where Republicans pushed through a rare midcycle redistricting this year to try to maintain their advantage in Congress after the 2026 midterm elections, experts say that excluding noncitizens when drawing districts could open another way for the GOP to tighten its grip on the state Legislature and congressional delegation.

In addition, many experts and critics worry it could ultimately place some Texas communities into larger, less cohesive districts, while diluting the political influence of Latinos and other minority groups who have accounted for much of the state’s population gain in recent decades. Adding questions about citizenship to the U.S. census could also lead to more undercounting of Latinos, they warn, a problem that has plagued previous censuses.

The various proposals raise substantial undecided legal and constitutional questions that would have to be settled in court, making the outcomes of such changes impossible to precisely predict. But to understand the possibilities if some or any of these proposals go forward, it’s helpful to separate them into three categories: changes to the census; changes to the apportionment of House seats and electoral votes among states; and changes to the drawing of congressional and state legislative districts, which happens at the state level.

How we count people — and which people count

Any effort to reanchor the distribution of political power around citizenship starts with the decennial census. Republicans and conservative groups are lining up behind a continuing effort to add a citizenship question to the questionnaire, a plan that ran into legal hurdles during the first Trump administration.

Under the Constitution, the decennial census — “counting the whole number of persons in each State” every 10 years — determines how many congressional representatives and electoral votes each state gets. As courts have interpreted this clause in the past, it means everyone is counted, regardless of their age, immigration or citizenship status, or eligibility to vote.

Trump has pushed this year for a new, mid-decade census that would not count immigrants without legal status. But the census has a long lead time. The Census Bureau says it’s been preparing for the 2030 census since 2019 and is planning to conduct a major on-the-ground test for it in 2026. The commerce secretary must submit census questions to Congress two years before the actual census takes place.

There are also several Republican-supported bills that would affect the census’s counting of noncitizens. They differ, but they generally call for using only the number of U.S. citizens, rather than the total population, to calculate how to apportion House seats and electoral votes among the states. Four Republican-led states earlier this year also sued the federal government, arguing that undocumented immigrants and immigrants with temporary visas shouldn’t be included, though that case has been stayed for now.

Some Republicans who support the proposals argue that including noncitizens creates imbalances in citizens’ voting power depending on where they live — rewarding jurisdictions that welcome undocumented immigrants. “Today, a voter in a congressional district with 730,000 citizens … and 30,000 illegal aliens has a stronger say in the election of his representative than a voter in a congressional district with 760,000 citizens and no illegal immigrants,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, said during a congressional committee hearing on the census in November.

Democrats, meanwhile, said the proposals would be unconstitutional and would hurt vulnerable populations.

“Alexander Hamilton is on record saying during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, ‘There can be no truer principle than this: that every individual of the community at large has an equal right to the protection of the government,’” said U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat. “Ultimately, the census is a national snapshot we take every 10 years that helps us understand and define who we are, how to govern, and undermining that process in ways that distort that picture will harm all of us.”

If all or some noncitizens were to be excluded from the census, states estimated to have large populations of noncitizens — a red and blue mix that includes Texas, California, New Jersey, Florida, and New York — could lose House seats and electoral votes, or gain fewer than they would have.

But multiple legal experts, including Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and professor at Loyola Law School who advised President Joe Biden’s administration on democracy and voting rights, and Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University’s College of Law and an expert on election and constitutional law and voting rights, say excluding all or some noncitizens from apportionment counts would be unconstitutional, given the clear language on apportionment in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. It would quickly draw legal challenges, and they don’t believe courts would allow it, they said.

But if the Trump administration adds a census question on citizenship, which wouldn’t in itself change the apportionment counts, that would generate the key data state officials would need to draw their internal U.S. House and state legislative district lines based on the population of citizens.

In a 2016 case over state-level redistricting in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court left open the question of whether states could use criteria other than total population, such as the population of eligible voters — roughly speaking, citizens age 18 or above — for the state-level task of drawing district maps. Texas, according to the court’s ruling in Evenwel v. Abbott, had argued that “jurisdictions may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, design districts using any population baseline—including total population and voter-eligible population—so long as the choice is rational and not invidiously discriminatory.”

Experts disagree, however, on whether the Supreme Court has left the question open for both congressional districts and state legislative districts or just for state legislative districts. Morley, for example, said the former, while Levitt believes the latter.

During the failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, evidence emerged showing a longtime political strategist had drawn up a case study showing that using the population of voting-age citizens rather than total population to draw Texas state House districts would advantage Republicans and non-Hispanic white Texans. That’s a big reason why some experts and advocates are concerned about the implications for communities of color.

If Texas draws districts to have equal populations of adult citizens rather than equal total populations, some districts would have to grow geographically to include enough adult citizens — creating districts that are larger geographically and by total population. The effects of using citizen voting-age population would likely be most pronounced in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and in the Rio Grande Valley, according to experts and an analysis by the Electoral Innovation Lab done earlier this year for Votebeat.

The effect will “tend to be to shift power away from urban areas that have larger numbers of noncitizens,” Morley said.

In these districts, U.S. citizens would see an impact as well. Individuals would have less representation if everyone isn’t counted, said Jonathan Cervas, a redistricting expert, assistant teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and collaborator with the Electoral Innovation Lab.

“That’s the real-world consequence” of redistricting based on citizen-only population counts in those areas, he said. Actual citizens “end up worse off.”

Let’s look at an example: The Rio Grande Valley

The Rio Grande Valley is one of the areas where new political boundaries based on citizenship voting-age population could have a profound effect, according to the analysis by Cervas, Neil Dixit, and Sam Wang of the Electoral Innovation Lab, as well as other redistricting experts.

Near the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border, neighboring Hidalgo and Cameron counties are home to more than 1 million people combined. The area has a diverse population that works in manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, retail, and food service industries.

Both counties also have multiple ports of entry between Mexico and the U.S., overwhelmingly Latino populations, and many mixed-status households.

The area is also home to more than 1,000 colonias — unincorporated rural communities that often lack access to basic services and infrastructure — housing anywhere from two dozen to over a thousand each.

The area is part of the Democratic-leaning 34th Congressional District, which, as it stands now, includes eastern Hidalgo County and all of Cameron, Kenedy, Kleberg, and Willacy counties. (The map state lawmakers passed this summer takes the Hidalgo County part of the district out and instead adds part of Nueces County.)

If the district had to be redrawn based on its citizen voting-age population, it would almost certainly need to grow geographically, according to an analysis by Cervas, because otherwise there wouldn’t be enough citizens in it to keep it equal to other districts.

Lupita Sanchez, a resident of Brownsville in Cameron County and executive director of Border Workers United, a nonpartisan immigrant advocacy nonprofit, said redistricting should be fair. “Everyone should be counted because everyone contributes to this nation in different ways,” she said.

Why the census citizenship question matters

The first Trump administration fell short in its push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the administration’s stated reasons for wanting to add the question were contrived — but it didn’t preclude asking it on a future census.

Aside from apportionment and redistricting, census data helps inform how trillions of dollars in funding are allocated to states to improve health, housing, education, and other community services. It helps businesses plan investments and local governments decide how to allocate resources, such as services for the elderly and where to build new roads, schools, or job training centers. So the developers of the census questionnaire strive to tread lightly with any change that might diminish response rates or compromise the completeness of the data they collect.

Census questionnaires are distributed to individual addresses and capture answers about everyone in the household. Even though the answers are not released to the public and are used only to generate statistics, experts have long said that adding a citizenship question would make some people, especially immigrants, less likely to respond to the census, resulting in less accurate data and further diminishing the political influence of some communities.

The Republican push to add a citizenship question “is designed to deepen the distrust and therefore trigger an even higher undercount, specifically of the Latino community,” said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which opposed the first Trump administration’s 2020 effort.

“Mistrust runs deep,” said Victoria Fajardo, a resident of Hidalgo County in the Rio Grande Valley and a community advocate with the immigrant and social services advocacy group La Union del Pueblo Entero (LUPE). That’s especially true in “mixed-status households” — families with U.S. citizens and noncitizens, including legal permanent residents and undocumented immigrants, under one roof. Around 8% of Texas households include an undocumented immigrant, according to Pew Research Center estimates from 2022.

People fear their personal information could be shared with government agencies for enforcement reasons, Fajardo said. Adding a citizenship question to the census “would just further the undercounting of the community. Especially under this administration,” she said, “where it feels like surveillance of immigrants is heightened.”

The census has already undercounted the population in parts of the Rio Grande Valley in the past, advocates say.

Prominent Texas officials supported Trump’s effort to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census, and Texas also joined a multistate brief filed with the Supreme Court in favor of the Trump administration’s position. In 2019, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the idea that it would lead to an undercount was “nothing other than conjecture.”

How redistricting is supposed to work

Each state’s political maps must be redrawn once per decade, after each census, to account for population growth and ensure that every congressional or legislative district has virtually the same number of people. Mid-decade redistricting, like the one Texas pushed through this year, is legal but unusual — although Trump’s push to add red seats in some states has set off a chain reaction of it this year.

In Texas and most other states, redistricting is the purview of the state legislature and governor, and if one party controls both, it can draw the boundaries for both congressional districts and state legislative districts as it sees fit. Within certain limits, state lawmakers can effectively decide which voters they want in each district, based on political or partisan objectives. The practice goes back centuries, but modern data tools have made it easier to precisely draw boundaries that include or exclude certain voters and maximize partisan advantage.

In other states, it’s up to a bipartisan or independent commission to oversee redistricting.

There are a few rules and principles that apply in all states. For example, a given state’s districts must have virtually equal populations. All states must comply with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, which means they can’t discriminate on the basis of race — though a U.S. Supreme Court decision is pending in a case out of Louisiana that could drastically change how the Voting Rights Act applies to redistricting.

There are also widely applied redistricting principles that call for districts to be, among other things, compact and contiguous and to preserve communities of interest and follow other lines, such as city boundaries, whenever possible. And several states have specific requirements of their own: In Texas, for example, lawmakers must also comply with the state constitution’s requirements when it comes to splitting counties between state House districts.

Courts have found Texas’ congressional maps to be racially gerrymandered in every decade from the 1970s to the 2010s.

The maps that Texas Republicans drew after the 2020 census were under challenge in court when lawmakers decided to redraw the state’s congressional map this summer, though judges had yet to rule. The new map was promptly challenged in court as well, and in November, a panel of federal judges struck down the map as a racial gerrymander. However, their decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled Dec. 4 that Texas could use its new congressional map while the high court considers the merits of the case. That makes it likely that the congressional map lawmakers passed this summer will be used in the 2026 election.

The Trump administration has drawn links between the surge in immigration during the administration of former President Joe Biden and road safety concerns.","The Trump administration said Wednesday that it has pulled nearly 10,000 commercial truck drivers off U.S. roadways for failing to speak English sufficiently.

The boast comes as trucking companies have raised alarms about drivers being targeted by President Donald Trump's immigration agenda.

""We've now knocked 9,500 truck drivers out of service for failing to speak our national language — ENGLISH!"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an X post.

""This administration will always put you and your family's safety first,"" Duffy said.

Duffy was responding to a report by Bloomberg that detailed fallout in the trucking industry from a new language policy and other rules.

The industry – which was already grappling with declining freight volumes and rising overheads – is bracing for a significant drop in the supply of drivers because of the federal government's enforcement actions, Bloomberg reported.

Trump signed an executive order in early March designating English as the country's official language.

In April, the president signed another order directing Duffy to ensure that commercial truck drivers who fail to meet English proficiency requirements are taken out of service.

That order rescinded an Obama-era policy, which the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration says directed personnel to issue citations to commercial drivers who violate English standards, but not remove them from service.

The strengthened enforcement policy went into effect in late June.

Texas and Wyoming have seen the largest number of drivers out of the more than 9,500 who have been pulled from the road, Bloomberg reported.

The Trump administration has drawn links between the surge in immigration during the administration of former President Joe Biden and road safety concerns.

Duffy, in late June, announced a nationwide audit of states' practices regarding issuing ""non-domiciled"" commercial driver's licenses, with a particular focus on the ""potential for unqualified individuals obtaining licenses and posing a hazard on our roads.""

""The open borders policies of the last administration allowed millions to flood our country – leading to serious allegations that the trucking licensing system is being exploited,"" Duffy said at the time.

The administration has pointed to the criminal case of Harjinder Singh, a commercial truck driver charged in August with causing a deadly crash on a Florida turnpike, as an example of the trucking industry becoming a ""lawless frontier.""

The Transportation Department issued emergency rules after the crash, limiting the issuance of commercial licenses to non-U.S. citizens.

In October, Duffy's department said it would withhold over $40 million from California after finding the state had not complied with the English proficiency standards.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108216750-17613309902025-10-24t174840z_1178496511_rc2gihaada2o_rtrmadp_0_usa-shutdown-travel.jpeg?v=1761331010&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:40.758583

called on the Warner Bros. board to recognize the consequences of selling the company, which includes news organization CNN, to billionaire foreign rulers.","Congressional Democrats are sounding alarms over the deep involvement of Saudi Arabian and other Middle Eastern royal families in Paramount’s proposed bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.

Warner Bros. Discovery owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film and television studios in Burbank behind such beloved American classics as “Casablanca,” “Citizen Kane” and Bugs Bunny, and blockbuster hits including “Harry Potter,” “Dirty Harry,” “The Matrix” and “Friends.”

Late last week, Paramount, which is controlled by billionaire Larry Ellison’s family, came up short in the bidding for Warner Bros., in part over the Warner board’s concerns about the financing of the deal. On Monday, Paramount launched a hostile takeover of Warner Bros., appealing directly to Warner shareholders — asking them to sell their stock to Paramount for $30 a share.

On Wednesday, Paramount sent a letter to Warner shareholders asking that they tender their shares, which would allow Paramount to acquire the company through its hostile takeover.

In the letter to Warner shareholders, Ellison’s son, David, who is Paramount’s chairman, wrote: “Our public offer ... delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix.”

It added that Paramount’s offer would be “financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.”

It did not disclose that the sovereign wealth funds were the majority of the new equity. Paramount’s gambit has thrown the auction, and the Warner board’s selection of Netflix’s $72-billion deal, into doubt.

Paramount has long insisted that it represents the best partner for Warner Bros., in part because of the Ellison family’s cozy relations with President Trump. The company has trumpeted its ability to gain the blessing of the Trump administration for its proposed deal.

Paramount’s bid is heavily backed by the sovereign funds of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The three royal families have agreed to contribute $24 billion — twice the amount the Larry Ellison family has said it would provide in financing for Paramount’s proposed $78-billion takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to regulatory filings.

Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, would also have an ownership stake.

On Wednesday, U.S. Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-San José) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) called on the Warner Bros. board to recognize the consequences of selling the company, which includes news organization CNN, to billionaire foreign rulers.

“This transaction raises national security concerns because it could transfer substantial influence over one of the largest American media companies to foreign-backed financiers,” Liccardo and Pressley wrote in a Wednesday letter to Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav.

“Warner’s platforms reach tens of millions of American households through HBO, Max, CNN, Warner Bros. Pictures, Discovery, and numerous digital and cable properties,” the lawmakers wrote. “They also shape the news, entertainment, and cultural content consumed by the American public.”

The concerns adds a new wrinkle to the Warner Bros. auction, which already had political overtones. Trump has said he planned to be involved in the decision-making, and he’s offered praise for both Larry and David Ellison and Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos, who has visited with the president leading up to last week’s auction deadline.

Transactions involving “foreign investors with governance rights, access to non-public data, or indirect influence over content distribution [create] vulnerabilities that foreign governments could exploit,” the lawmakers wrote. They asked the Warner board, should it opt for Paramount, to agree to a federal review of the transaction to determine whether the involvement of the Middle Eastern investors would pose a national security risk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would lead any such review.

Paramount, in its regulatory filings, said the three Middle Eastern royal families had agreed to give up voting rights and a role in the company’s decision-making — despite contributing more than half the equity needed for the deal.

Paramount has said it would not be required to submit the proposed Warner transaction to the federal Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S., or CFIUS, because the sovereign wealth funds have waived their governance rights, should the Ellison family prevail in the bidding for Warner Bros.

“Paramount might not need CFIUS but the American people do,” Liccardo said in an interview with The Times. “We need to ask ourselves: What is of value that would command a $24-billion investment from three royal families?”

Traditional film and TV production companies are part of “an industry that is struggling mightily,” Liccardo said. “So if you look at an acquisition like this ... if not for the going concern, what particular assets are of value? Consider the sensitive personal data of tens of millions of Americans, and ask how valuable that data might be?”

Representatives of Warner Bros. and Paramount declined to comment.

The Ellison family acquired Paramount in August. David Ellison, the chief executive, attended a White House dinner last month in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The involvement of Mohammed and his Saudi Public Investment Fund was concerning to the two lawmakers.

“The fund is controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom (according to the declassified 2021 report of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence) ordered the murder of U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi,” the lawmakers wrote.

They noted that Kushner’s Affinity Partners was also backed by a $2-billion investment from the Saudi Public Investment Fund. Paramount has not disclosed how much Kushner would contribute to the Paramount-Warner deal.

Liccardo’s Northern California district includes Los Gatos, where Netflix is based. Liccardo, in the interview, said Netflix was unaware of his effort until after the letter was drafted.

Over the weekend, Trump said the proposed Netflix purchase, which would give the streaming company an even more commanding presence in the industry, “could be a problem.” The president on Wednesday said he wanted CNN to be included in the deal because he doesn’t trust “the people that are running that company right now.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has voiced concerns about Netflix’s dominance should it acquire Warner.

“The Netflix purchase of Warner Bros. would be a disaster,” Murphy wrote on X last weekend. “It’s patently illegal. But there are some quietly rooting for it because a Paramount takeover (that includes CNN) would be worse.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08923d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4152x2180+0+294/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2Ff1%2F81f4980c4e279fcd62e260fb5feb%2F3d08c6b11ed54ca3926ddc18fc893003.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:45.213405

Searches for “alien,” “overstay” and “unlawful entry.” Dozens of searches for “immigration,” and “immigration+.” More than 700 searches with just “ICE” as the reason. Hundreds of searches made by Border Patrol and Homeland Security.

For the first six months of 2025, federal and out-of-state law enforcement agencies across the country searched Spokane County Flock cameras, in many cases explicitly using the technology to hunt down undocumented immigrants.

In Washington, state law prevents local and state resources from being used to assist in federal immigration enforcement. But as electeds like the Spokane City Council celebrate the Keep Washington Working Act for protecting immigrants and Congressman Michael Baumgartner criticizes it for “prioritizing criminal aliens over law-abiding citizens,” the law has proven ineffectual when it comes to protecting immigrants’ data from federal overreach.

As news has continued to break statewide that Washington immigrants’ data has been accessed by federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol through weak protection mechanisms at the Department of Licensing and access to local Flock networks given by agencies across the state, documents obtained by RANGE show that Spokane County is no exception.

Earlier this year, we requested a network audit of all searches of the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office’s (SCSO) Flock network made between January 1, 2025 to June 23, 2025, which shows the requesting agency, the search reason they gave, any case number attached, when they searched and how many networks and cameras they searched from.

According to the audit, US Border Patrol (USBP) had direct access to search Spokane County Flock cameras through at least June 23. They used that access to search Spokane County cameras 186 times, with nine of those searches specifically looking for people in Washington.

The searches made directly by USBP are just the tip of the iceberg; reporting by 404 Media revealed that ICE had access to Flock cameras across the country through a login registered to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which performed hundreds of searches nationally during 2025.

That HSI account made 182 searches on Spokane County cameras in the first six months of 2025.

While some of the HSI searches make a clear case for why they’re using Flock cameras, citing “Human trafficking,” or a specific case number, many of their requests had no case number attached and used vague terms like “investigative,” “officer safety,” or “Linked to an ongoing investigations [sic],” in the search field, which makes it nearly impossible to tell who or what they were actually looking for with those searches.

Spokane County Sheriff John Nowels told The Spokesman Review in October that agencies like Border Patrol and ICE do not have immediate access to the county Flock database. However, the network audit shows these searches were being made all the way up until the last active day of our request — June 23. The sheriff’s office has been unable to say exactly when they turned off the national look-up feature, which allowed federal and out-of-state agencies blanket permission to search local cameras.

What is Flock and who else has access to these cameras?

Flock is a surveillance technology brand that sells a specific brand of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) that are used on a subscription model by law enforcement agencies across the state.

The cameras constantly log photos of any car that drives past them, whether that driver has potentially committed a crime or not, which is then stored for up to 30 days in a database owned by the law enforcement agencies. That database can then be searched by whoever has a direct log-in to it, or any agencies that it has been shared with. Read more about Flock cameras in our region and where they’re located here.

The county currently has more than 60 Flock cameras operational in the region, including mobile Flock cameras mounted on cars that travel the county.

The side door

Flock software is somewhat complex to describe, but essentially there are settings SCSO can toggle on and off. They can add organizations to a list that are allowed to search their data, which researchers at the University of Washington (UW) call “front door” access. SCSO can also turn on or off a “National Look-up” feature, which allows organizations across the country to search their cameras without express agency-level permission. This is what UW researchers call “back door access.”

It’s unclear what SCSO’s network settings are and whether they share camera access with Border Patrol directly or if these searches were made through “back door” access because RANGE’s public records requests for that information sent in August have not yet been filled.

Direct searches from Border Patrol and ICE weren’t the only way Spokane cameras were used to assist in federal operations. At least 45 out-of-state agencies, mostly local police departments from red states, made more than 1,000 immigration-related searches on Spokane County cameras.

Search reasons included “immigration violations,” “immigration overstay,” “alien” and “ice pick-up,” among others. There were also other searches that we can’t say with 100% certainty are for immigration reasons, but raised some red flags, like: “suspicious traveler” “overstay,” and “suspicious vehicle at border entry.” Even searches for “missing/endangered” people could be suspicious, given that Texas sheriffs searched for a woman who got an abortion — who they were investigating for the death of her fetus — and publicly stated it was for a welfare check.

More than 700 searches were made — mostly from police departments in Florida, Georgia and Texas — that just gave “ICE” as their search reason.

The researchers at UW call these searches made by one agency on behalf of another agency “side door access.”

This has gone as far as Illinois police officer Todd Hutchison giving his log in to a DEA agent who made immigration-related searches on Hutchison’s account. None of those searches checked Spokane’s cameras, however, six other searches from Hutchison labelled “narcotics,” do appear on the log.

In October, Sheriff John Nowels told The Spokesman that if federal agencies asked for information related to a criminal investigation, his office would provide it, but that hadn’t happened yet. “If in fact we have provided anything to federal law enforcement offices it would be because of a criminal investigation,” he said.

While SCSO deputies don’t seem to have made any obvious “side door” searches on behalf of ICE or Border Patrol, contrary to what Nowels told The Spokesman, his employees made plenty of searches for other federal law enforcement offices.

We found at least 167 searches made on behalf of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Marshals Service — all federal agencies. Some or all of these searches may have been for active criminal investigations, but it’s impossible to know for sure; only a single one of these searches had a case number attached.

Most search fields simply had things like “usms fugitive,” “ATF Request,” “HSI DEA Assist,” or “usms.”

While SCSO has declined to return multiple requests for comment, they did take an initial phone call from RANGE on Monday, November 24. During that call, Nowels and spokesperson Mark Gregory didn’t deny making searches on behalf of federal agencies.

“We don’t do it for HSI, not even HSI, but we don’t do it for civil detainers, anything like that,” Nowels said. “But if HSI is working a human trafficking case, the US Marshals are out looking for bad guys, we will look stuff up for them and I think it’s appropriate and it does not violate the Keep Washington Working Act.” (A civil immigration detainer is a request to law enforcement to keep a person in local custody for deportation.)

The KWWA states that: “State and local law enforcement agencies may not provide nonpublicly available personal information about an individual, including individuals subject to community custody pursuant to RCW 28 9.94A.701 and 9.94A.702, to federal immigration authorities in a noncriminal matter, except as required by state or federal law.”

After news broke that these kinds of “side door” searches were showing up on cameras across Washington, including Mukilteo, Lynwood and Everett, State Sen. Marko Liias (D-Edmonds) told the Everett Herald that this kind of access “violates the spirit of our Keep Washington Working Act.”

“The goal of the Legislature was that the federal government would manage its immigration enforcement and that our state and local resources would be focused on protecting our communities from more immediate crimes and public safety risks,” Liias told the Herald.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington has maintained that sharing state-collected data like license plate information with federal immigration agencies is against Washington state law, calling the KWWA “the floor, not the ceiling,” of state protections.

Last Wednesday, we asked the SCSO spokesperson Mark Gregory if SCSO was aware that the county Flock cameras were searched for immigration violations, if the county considers these searches to be violations of the KWWA, and if the county was even aware that federal agencies had access to search Spokane County cameras all the way up until at least June 23.

They have declined to answer. We will update the story if they ever do.

The blank door

The front, side and back doors at least leave some kind of trace. The fourth option — which we’re calling “the blank door,” — is more nefarious.

While searches blatantly looking for “immigration” can now be blocked by the network owners, as reporting from The Urbanist pointed out, there is no easy way to curb queries with vague, blank or dishonest search reasons.

In the first six months of 2025, there were almost 70,000 searches on the SCSO cameras where the sole reason given for the search was “investigation” and the case number field was left blank.

When you factor in variations on the term investigation, like “inv,” “INV,” or “investigative,” there are hundreds of thousands of searches made with a vague search reason and no case number listed.

SCSO and Spokane Police Department (SPD) officers combined made at least 81 of those searches, and an additional 20 searches with the reason as “1” and no case number attached.

These kinds of searches with nondescript search fields make it impossible to tell what the user is actually searching for. It could be an immigration-related search on the sly for a federal officer who asked. It could be tracking an ex-girlfriend’s movements. It could also be for an ongoing missing person or murder investigation, but there is no way of knowing when officers include no information on why they’re searching sometimes tens of thousands of cameras for the sole purpose of “investigation.”

Despite the thousands of searches with invalid reasons, Nowels told RANGE last week that they do quarterly audits of Flock searches and that no officer had ever been disciplined for misuse of the system, to his knowledge.

He also said, “Everybody who searches the system, they have to identify what case number they’re using or what reason they’re actually querying the data. You can’t just go in on a free-for-all. There has to be some reason you’re accessing the data.”

SCSO declined to provide current internal policies, but training documents from 2024 that we reviewed state that “investigation” and non-descriptive search reasons are “bad” reasons to search Flock.

We asked the county last week specifically about these searches that are left blank and whether there were any plans to curb this kind of usage of the Flock cameras. We asked what potential consequences an employee might face for misuse of the system.

We also asked how many cases the SCSO has solved specifically because of Flock technology.

They declined to provide answers. If they do, we will update this story.

At least 27 countries — more than half the members of the Council of Europe, the main organization protecting human rights on the continent — have now called for a rethink of the treaty’s interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights, diplomatic sources told AFP after the talks.

They include the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands — but notably not France or Germany, they said.

ECHR rulings on migration issues have irked several European governments in recent years, including emergency injunctions that on occasion blocked deportations at the last minute.

“We are facing real and big challenges and migration issues are one of those concerns,” Council of Europe secretary general Alain Berset, who convened the meeting of justice ministers and other key officials, told reporters.

He insisted that the discussion in Strasbourg had not been about “changing” the convention, but described the charter as a “living instrument” that had evolved since it was written up decades ago.

The countries are particularly concerned with the interpretation of the convention’s right to a private and family life, and how this risks being used to prevent removal of individuals who these states say have no right to remain.

Writing in Britain’s Guardian daily Wednesday, U.K. premier Keir Starmer and his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen said the ministers meeting in Strasbourg would “push for a modernization of the interpretation” of the convention.

That would allow it to “evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century,” they said.

The British government, which has long aired concerns over the treaty, has faced calls from the right to quit the convention after London’s exit from the European Union.

But Berset pointedly added that all 46 member states had affirmed “their deep and abiding commitment to both the court and the convention.”

A “political declaration” would be prepared for a ministerial meeting next year as a “first step” on finding a way forward.

‘Contemporary challenges’

The Council of Europe was set up in the wake of World War II as the guardian of human rights in Europe in a move championed by British wartime premier Winston Churchill, with its member states signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights.

Its implementation is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights, an instance of last resort.

Next year’s political declaration would set out the “obligation to ensure the effective enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention to everyone within the jurisdiction of member states,” according to the ministerial conclusions.

But they would have to be “in the context of the contemporary challenges posed both by irregular migration and by the situation of foreigners convicted of serious offences,” they continued.

The 27 states seeking further action have urged a “balance” between the individual rights of migrants and “the public interest in defending freedom and security,” according to a document seen by AFP.

U.K. Justice Minister David Lammy, who is also Starmer’s deputy, emphasized that the United Kingdom “is committed to the convention.”

But he added: “To secure its future, we must ensure it evolves — striking the balance between individual rights and public interest to deliver peace, stability and security for the 21st century.”

‘Inaccuracies and assumptions’

France, which is not among the states calling for changes, “confirms its commitment to the independence of the court,” Pap Ndiaye, France’s ambassador to the Council of Europe, told AFP, denouncing an “insidious” move by the 27 fellow members.

The Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights Michael O’Flaherty meanwhile urged the ministers to be “assiduously evidence-based.”

He expressed concern over “inaccuracies and assumptions currently in circulation,” in particular the notion that changing the convention would “impact irregular migratory flows.”

“You are embarked on an extremely consequential pathway in terms of the well-being of Europe’s human rights protection system,” he said.

Consider upgrading today to skip the paywall every time.","Inhumane. Racist. A disgrace. These are all words that have been used to describe US President Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policy.

But in this ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’ interview, US Congressman Maxwell Frost uses a different term to describe the White House’s immigration plan.

“Donald Trump and the people he has around him, people like Stephen Miller, want to ethnically cleanse this country,” Frost tells Mehdi. “They don’t want Black and brown people from other places in this country… that’s part of the reason why they’re using essentially the weapons of the government and the process of the government to kick people out.”

Of course, Frost’s rebuke of the Trump administration does not stop at immigration. In the interview, he also slams Trump’s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who has been facing major backlash after the Washington Post reported that he ordered the military to leave no survivors in an attack on a Caribbean boat in September.

At issue is Senate Bill 76 — authored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, after she blocked a bill with some similar provisions during the last legislative session. That move resulted in Rokita claiming she did so because she has an “illegal alien” in her family.

Her current proposal includes language allowing state agencies and Rokita’s office to investigate the “employment of an unauthorized alien” and report possible violations to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Indiana Department of Labor.

Rokita, however, is backing a differing proposal in Senate Bill 122, which would give the attorney general’s office authority to seek court orders suspending an “employer’s operating authorizations” over such suspected violations.

Rokita, a Republican, blasted Brown on social media over her bill, saying she had “introduced a watered-down, bizarro world version … that takes all the enforcement teeth out of the bill. That makes her bill meaningless.”

Brown countered that she has worked with entities from the Trump administration to county sheriffs in order to find effective ways to help enforce federal immigration laws.

“The biggest thing is making sure that we didn’t grow government and that the power isn’t centered in one agency or individual,” Brown told reporters.

Hiring practices in question

Erin Tuttle, the attorney general office’s legislative director, criticized Brown’s bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally.

“The Supreme Court has confirmed that states may sanction the license of employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers,” Tuttle said. “If Indiana refuses to adopt the one enforcement mechanism available under federal law, it cannot credibly claim to be a leader in combating illegal immigration.”

Immigrant advocates, however, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation.

Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, told committee members that the proposal encourages racial profiling by businesses.

“It pushes them toward discriminatory hiring practices, meaning someone who fits a certain look or has a certain name or has an accent may be discriminated against, just out of precaution,” Castoreno said. “We know who is harmed, people with brown skin, people with accents, people with names that sound unfamiliar to an HR manager.”

Committee members voted 6-2 along party lines to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in early January.

Rokita-Brown conflict continues

The dispute between Rokita and Brown over the legislation grows out of their conflict over an immigration-enforcement bill from the legislative session earlier this year.

House members approved House Bill 1531 in February, but Brown did not hold a Senate committee hearing on the bill and it died when the legislative session ended in April.

Rokita then claimed Brown had blocked the legislation because she had a “family member who’s an illegal alien.”

Brown called that claim “blatantly false.” She also filed an attorney misconduct grievance over Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission that she said Tuesday was still pending.

Rokita and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over last session’s bill.

They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a Republican primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.

Following the committee vote, Rokita posted to X that the bill “would actively shield sanctuary jurisdictions and directly undermines our ongoing lawsuits to end sanctuary policies in Monroe and St. Joseph counties. We need to stop illegal immigration—not protect the counties and officials who defy state law and put Hoosier families last.”",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Indiana-Statehouse-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:55.432750

In a complaint filed Wednesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court, advocacy groups Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition and Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice said the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office violated state law by agreeing to house federal detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service.

“The county cannot allow federal agents to use our local jail as a pipeline to immigration detention,” said David Henretty, an attorney at Oregon Law Center, which is representing the groups.

“When a judge says you’re free, you’re free. That’s not optional,” he said. “Oregon law requires it, and this lawsuit will enforce it.”

Immigration Customs and Enforcement, or ICE, aren’t the ones carrying out immigration operations. In January, the Department of Homeland Security authorized other federal law enforcement to carry out the functions of an immigration officer, including the U.S. Marshals.

“As immigrant communities face increasing threats from federal agents, they need to know that Oregon will back them up with action, not just words,” a spokesperson for PIRC said in a press release.

“We are taking action so jails follow the law and release people when judges order them free.”

According to the lawsuit, the sheriff’s office entered into an agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service in October 2019 to lodge federal detainees at county jail facilities, including those who are awaiting immigration or deportation proceedings.

The advocacy groups are asking for a court order requiring the sheriff’s office to revise its agreement with the U.S. Marshals, to either stop holding detainees for immigration purposes or terminate the agreement if they refuse.

The assertion, contained in a response to a public information request from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, contradicted the Trump administration’s sworn court testimony and the fact that it had previously submitted video footage to a judge. The response also raised questions about whether the administration is fully complying with a court order that required the use of body cameras in the monthslong operation, which has included a string of allegations of excessive force.

“Sometimes a no response is more telling than having records” from a public information request, said Anne Weismann, who oversaw records litigations at the Justice Department at the end of her two decades at the department. “And this may be one of those cases.”

In a letter dated Tuesday, ICE told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that “no records responsive to your request were found.” The foundation had requested “all body-worn camera footage” taken as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which was announced in September. Judge Sara L. Ellis, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, had mandated that agents, including ones at ICE, wear body cameras beginning in October.

Experts in public records laws say such a response is a troubling sign that the Trump administration may be trying to evade public oversight mechanisms. Its immigration enforcement agencies are accused of violating civil liberties and state laws while they strive to meet the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation goal of one million people per year.

The response “indicates that ICE continues to feel increasing impunity” as an agency “exempt from accountability,” said Lauren Harper, who advocates for government transparency at the nonprofit. “It is extremely implausible that ICE does not have any of this footage — it just strikes me as beyond the pale.”

Neither ICE, in its letter, nor the Department of Homeland Security, in a response to questions from The New York Times, directly explained why the letter said there were no records of body camera footage even though administration lawyers had submitted such clips to Judge Ellis.

ICE’s letter implied that such records might be shielded, citing some exemptions to open records laws, including ones on national security, ongoing criminal investigations and information that can expose government informants’ identities. Ms. Weismann said the requested records did not qualify for such exemptions “under any reasonable interpretation.”

But in an emailed statement, the Homeland Security Department seemed to imply that such footage might not even exist, emphasizing the limits of the body camera requirements, saying they applied only to immigration agents who already had cameras and had been trained to use them.

“The premise of your story is false and overly simplifies the court’s relevant order,” the department said in its statement. “ICE never violated the court order.”

The limited known camera footage in the operation has already caused legal problems for the Trump administration. Judge Ellis used the clips submitted to her to rule that officers acted illegally with excessive force.

The letter also arrived as the Homeland Security Department and the Trump administration have faced repeated questions on their willingness to abide by public records laws.

In August, the department rebuffed a request for public records related to the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles this summer, saying that the agency had not maintained text message data among top officials since early April. The agency later attributed the lapse in data storage to its decision to stop using software that automatically captured officials’ text message data and instead to require officials to manually take screenshots of their messages for compliance.

Under the Federal Records Act, government agencies are required to preserve all documentation that officials and federal workers produce while executing their duties, and they have to make federal records available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act unless they fall under certain exemptions.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/10/multimedia/10dc-dhs-foia-mzqc/10dc-dhs-foia-mzqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 01:56:23.813081

Quick Hits

In its 2025–26 term, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship.

Oral arguments are expected to take place in the spring of 2026; the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

Although the executive order is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision, USCIS has issued guidance outlining how the order would be applied and enforced, if upheld.

In January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14160, which aimed to place restrictions on birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who were present in the country temporarily or without lawful status. The order would significantly abridge the long-standing constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for virtually all children born in the United States, as recognized in the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The order has not yet taken effect; multiple lawsuits produced preliminary injunctions in the lower courts. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published an implementation plan in July, outlining how the order would be applied.

Background on EO 14160

Section 1 of the executive order provides that a child born in the United States would no longer automatically be entitled to citizenship at birth in two situations: (1) when the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; or (2) when the mother’s presence was lawful but temporary (for example, under the Visa Waiver Program or on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

EO 14160 directs federal agencies to withhold citizenship documentation for such births, with the policy applying prospectively thirty days after the order, while clarifying that it does not affect, for example, children of lawful permanent residents. The order frames this position as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 8 U.S.C. § 1401’s “subject to the jurisdiction” language.

Legal Challenges to EO 14160

Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the executive order on birthright citizenship as unconstitutional under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment (the “Citizenship Clause”). Federal district judges in Washington State and Maryland entered injunctions blocking enforcement while the cases proceeded. In late June, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court curtailed federal district courts’ use of so-called nationwide (universal) injunctions, without resolving the order’s constitutionality, and litigation continued in the lower courts.

Following CASA, in Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction and an order granting provisional class certification, which prevented the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a certified class of babies born on or after February 20, 2025, who otherwise would be denied U.S. citizenship under the executive order. And in State of Washington v. Trump, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the executive order was “invalid because it contradict[ed] the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

In September 2025, the Trump administration’s lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court for review. The Trump administration’s certiorari petition requested that the Supreme Court review both Washington and Barbara; however, the Court’s order of December 5, 2025, indicates it will only take up the issue in Barbara. The case, expected to be argued in the spring with a definitive ruling to be issued by the end of June or early July 2026, will likely determine the future of birthright citizenship in the United States.

USCIS’s Implementation Plan for EO 14160

Although the EO is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Barbara, USCIS’s implementation plan, released on July 25, 2025, outlines how the order would be applied if it were ultimately upheld. The memo explains that “unlawfully present” refers to people in the United States without permission or those who have stayed longer than allowed, as defined in Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It also explains the difference between “unlawful status” and “unlawfully present.” For example, people paroled into the United States might not have a lawful immigration status, but they are not considered unlawfully present if they have permission to stay from the attorney general.

Since the term “lawful but temporary” presence isn’t clearly defined in the INA, USCIS has provided its own definition. This includes people who are in the United States legally for a limited time or under conditions that require them to reapply for continued stay. Examples include nonimmigrants, parolees, temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries, and deferred action recipients. USCIS also addresses the status of children born in the United States to parents with lawful but temporary status. These children do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents are not U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or U.S. nationals. To avoid negative immigration consequences for these children, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and USCIS propose allowing them to register and acquire the lawful status of at least one parent.

This proposal is similar to existing provisions for children of foreign diplomats born in the United States, who can acquire lawful immigration status through registration. Until this proposal is implemented, DHS suggests deferring immigration enforcement actions, including detention, removal, or deportation against these children, even though they may not be recognized as U.S. citizens under the proposed policy.

If the constitutionality of the executive order is upheld, a U.S. birth certificate alone would no longer suffice as proof of citizenship. Parents would need to provide documentation of the mother’s lawful status or the father’s citizen or permanent resident status.

Next Steps

With the executive order’s enforcement currently halted, the future of this policy remains uncertain. The Supreme Court will determine whether to uphold EO 14160, with significant implications for foreign nationals in the United States, depending on the scope of the ruling. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June or July of 2026.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14838_2817.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:00:34.736082

“ICE is disproportionately targeting Latinos for arrest, both nationally and in New York state,” Vice President of Policy at the New York Immigration Coalition Mario Bruzzone explained.
“For example, Ecuadorians are 4% of non-citizens in New York State, but they are 24.9% of ICE arrests.
Mexicans are 5.6% of non-citizens but they’re 9.9% of ICE arrests.
Over the last six months, amNewYork has documented the impacts of ICE arrests at Federal Plaza court proceedings and around the Big Apple.","ICE arrests in New York and other parts of America have disproportionately targeted Latino individuals for arrest and potential deportation, a new report has found.

Revealed by the New York Immigration Coalition, the report examined data gathered from the University of California, Berkeley on immigration arrests made from the final year of the Biden administration on Jan. 1, 2024, to the first six months of the Trump administration ending in July 2025, and focuses on New York state.

Even though Central and South American residents make up just a quarter of the city’s immigrant population, the report found that immigrants from Central and South America comprised nearly three-fourths of all ICE arrests in the Big Apple.

“ICE is disproportionately targeting Latinos for arrest, both nationally and in New York state,” Vice President of Policy at the New York Immigration Coalition Mario Bruzzone explained. “For example, Ecuadorians are 4% of non-citizens in New York State, but they are 24.9% of ICE arrests. Mexicans are 5.6% of non-citizens but they’re 9.9% of ICE arrests. Guatemalans are 1.6% of non-citizens but 8.4% of ICE arrests. Hondurans 1.3% of non-citizens but 6.0% of ICE arrests and so forth.”

Bruzzone went on to state that the report also found that the person’s Latino country of origin did not matter — the individuals were apprehended based merely on their ethnicity.

“What we want to show here and emphasize is that it doesn’t matter what country of Latin America you come from, you are disproportionately subject to arrest at a population level,” Bruzzone added.

The statistics also show that men are prime targets of ICE. Although they make up 50% of the immigrant population, the numbers show that males make up 89% of those arrested by ICE.

Over the last six months, amNewYork has documented the impacts of ICE arrests at Federal Plaza court proceedings and around the Big Apple. In many instances, the individuals arrested were men and the primary source of household income — forcing their wives and children to struggle with food and financial insecurity without them.

In two such examples, Alexandra Alvarez, was left alone with her less than one-year-old baby, while Jessica Supliguicha was left to care for a newborn and a 9-year-old child, after ICE agents arrested their husbands.

According to Chloe East, associate professor of Economics at the University of Colorado Boulder, law enforcement arrests of immigrants with criminal records have decreased, while street raids that happen on the corners of blocks, apartment complexes, and other community areas are on the rise.

“Almost 70% of people who are arrested have no criminal conviction,” East said. “Every time ICE ramps up its community arrests, its ability to prioritize individuals with criminal records goes down.”

Border Czar Tom Homan has repeatedly claimed that ICE is targeting “the worst of the worst,” meaning immigrants with criminal backgrounds. The reality, however, is that often ICE agents in New York and elsewhere are abducting an array of individuals — men, women, and children — regardless of their background.

Previous reports in amNewYork have shown masked ICE agents pulling children from their families and pulling pedestrians without a criminal history into unmarked cars.

While ICE arrests in the Big Apple have not been as heavy as those found in other cities and states across the country, such as Los Angeles, the Immigration Coalition warns that if Trump were to order a federal takeover of New York, those numbers would rapidly increase.",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-17.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-12-11 02:57:28.402049

Source also asked what a decline in detainees could mean for the future of the facility.","The number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held at an Estancia jail has decreased sharply since its contract with the federal government expired Oct. 31, according to newly released data.

The number of detainees dropped from a peak of up to 700 detainees in May to approximately 340 as of late November, according to data from the Deportation Data Project, run by a team of lawyers and academics who analyze ICE data they receive via public records requests.

According to that data and interviews with people with regular access to the jail, the decline began on or shortly after Oct. 31, when an intergovernmental service agreement between ICE and Torrance County expired without explanation.

Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

The contract’s expiration means ICE no longer pays roughly $2.5 million monthly to private contractor CoreCivic, Torrance County officials said during a County Commission meeting Wednesday in Estancia. Officials told Source New Mexico they are concerned about the potential economic implications for the county, which relies on the jail as a major employer and tax revenue source, if the population continues to decline and no contract extension is reached.

While the expiration and subsequent detainee decline have no immediate financial implications for the county, County Manager Jordan Barela said he is keenly interested in what a new contract might say and what that could mean for the jail’s future.

“The big financial obligation would be if the facility closed, because we lose that guaranteed revenue and, two, now we incur the expenses of having to transport our inmates miles away to other counties,” he said.

Immigrant advocates, however, said they remain concerned that CoreCivic, the private company, no longer has any financial incentive or legal reason to provide adequate care at a facility they say already has a long history of substandard care.

“Conditions there could continue to decline, and it’s alarming that hundreds of people are being held in New Mexico under no apparent authority,” Zoe Bowman, managing attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, which has clients at the jail, told Source New Mexico.

The expiration has renewed calls from advocates and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) that ICE immediately stop housing detainees in Torrance County. Standard operating procedures require that ICE remove all detainees and equipment absent a contract, and Heinrich has pressed ICE’s director to explain what legal authority it has to continue holding detainees.

The decrease in population identified in the Deportation Data Project has continued into December, according to PJ Podesta, a senior program manager for Innovation Law Lab, which conducts weekly jail visits. His best estimate is that 250 ICE detainees are at the jail, based on conversations with detainees in different pods.

NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The decline is “striking,” Bowman said, given that the number of ICE detainees is increasing or staying level at New Mexico’s other two ICE detention facilities in Milan and Chaparral, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearing House, along with other facilities across the country amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push.

“The Trump administration is doing absolutely everything they can to detain as many people as possible and fill ICE detention beds,” she said.

Podesta and Rogelio Bolufé, a Cuban immigrant detained at the facility who says he’s also witnessed the decline, told Source that they believe the reduction in population is because CoreCivic is not admitting new detainees, while ICE is transferring detainees out at the usual rate.

The detainees Podesta has been able to track from Estancia have mostly ended up at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

Source New Mexico asked ICE and CoreCivic on Tuesday about whether a decrease has occurred and, if so, what the reason might be behind it, including whether the expired contract played a role. Source also asked what a decline in detainees could mean for the future of the facility.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment. CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd did not address those questions in an emailed response to Source New Mexico, though he noted that the population “may fluctuate week to week” at the jail.

“He was trying to be strong for his wife and kids in the car, but the anxiety and fear were palpable,” she said. “His wife was trying to hold back tears, but I could see her in the rearview mirror silently crying.”

They had fled Afghanistan under threat by the Taliban because the wife’s father had assisted the U.S. military, and they had asked for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, Garcia said. She is not identifying him or his family for fear other members could be arrested.

Afghan men arrested in wake of shooting

Since the Nov. 26 Guard shooting, The Associated Press has tracked roughly two dozen arrests of Afghan immigrants, most of which happened in Northern California. In Sacramento, home to one of the nation’s largest Afghan communities, volunteers monitoring ICE activities say they witnessed at least nine arrests at the federal building last week after Afghan men received calls to check in there.

Many of those detained had requested asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in the last two years. Others were among the 76,000 Afghans brought to the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome, created by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the chaotic withdrawal of the U.S. from their country.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Dec. 1 that the Trump administration is “actively reexamining” all the Afghan nationals who entered the U.S. during Biden’s administration.

The AP couldn’t independently determine each of the Afghans’ immigration statuses or the reasons put forward by authorities for their arrests. In one case, the man had been arrested twice on suspicion of domestic violence, according to the government.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland, said in an email that the agency “has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden’s fraudulent parole programs and working to get the criminals and public safety threats OUT of our country.”

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the 29-year-old Afghan suspect in the shooting, was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

Critics say Afghans paying price for one bad actor

Since the shooting, the U.S. government introduced sweeping immigration changes, including pausing asylum applications and requiring increased vetting for immigrants from certain countries. The administration also took steps specifically targeted at Afghans, including pausing all their immigration-related applications and visas for Afghans who closely helped the war effort.

Those who work with Afghans say the stepped-up enforcement amounts to the collective punishment of a population, many of whom risked their lives to protect U.S. troops.

“Not to discount the horrific killing that happened, but that was one bad actor who should be prosecuted by the full extent of the law,” Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, whose California district includes Sacramento, said of Lakanwal. “A lot of these people kept our troops safe and served side by side with our soldiers for two decades in Afghanistan.”

Cuffed after reporting to ICE

In Sacramento, Afghan men arrived one by one to the ICE office Dec. 1 after being asked to immediately report there, drawing the attention of volunteers who have been at the federal building for more than six months to monitor ICE activities and alert immigrants.

As each man entered the office, agents handcuffed them, said Garcia, a volunteer with NorCal Resist.

“What we saw on Monday was an influx of Afghan immigrants called randomly starting at 6 a.m. and asked to do a check-in and report immediately,” Garcia said. “Most of these Afghan men already had ankle monitors on them.”

Her organization’s volunteers witnessed ICE arrest six Afghans that day.

Arrests and cancellations cause fear

In Des Moines, Iowa, Ann Naffier, with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, said her Afghan client was detained Dec. 2 on the way to work by agents who called him a “terrorist.” He was held for two hours before he was released with an apology.

Wahida Noorzad is an immigration attorney in Northern California who has two Afghan clients who were arrested last week by ICE. Both entered the U.S. in recent years through the southern border. One used the app set up by the Biden administration to make an appointment to request asylum at the border.

Noorzad felt both had strong cases to eventually be granted asylum in the U.S. She also said she found no criminal records for them.

Spojmie Nasiri, another immigration attorney in Northern California, said she’s received numerous calls from worried Afghans, including a man who called her terrified as agents stood outside his home. He put her on speaker phone so she could tell them that her client was a U.S. citizen.

Iqbal Wafa, an Afghan immigration consultant in Sacramento, said officials told his client when he went to his appointment last week that interviews for Afghans are canceled, and he observed interviews for other Afghan immigrants were canceled as well inside the federal building in Sacramento.

His client, who asked to be identified only by his last name, Mohammadi, out of fear his comments could affect the safety of relatives in Afghanistan, said he came to the U.S. with his family in 2017 after working as a security guard for both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineering and the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan for 12 years. He said he watched last week as other people who weren’t Afghans went into their interviews before learning his was canceled.

“I started thinking, ‘I haven’t done anything,’” Mohammadi said. He said he felt betrayed after the hard work that led up to the interview for U.S. citizenship. “What will happen to our futures?”

Rohullah R., 30, wondered the same. He worked at an animal shelter in Kabul, Afghanistan, and came to the U.S. in 2024 after being sponsored by a New York animal welfare organization. He did not want his last name used out of fear it would harm his case. He said the pause on his green card application process has “created a lot of challenges” and for many Afghans like him their “spirit is down.”

A family left crying

Garcia said she listened through the wall of the waiting room at the ICE office and heard agents handcuff the father of the family she was helping.

“I’m screaming his rights through the wall so he could hear me. ‘Remain silent! Please don’t sign anything!’” she said. She left after security approached.

When she walked out of the building without him, she said his wife broke down sobbing.

Their daughter tried to console her, telling her, “Mommy, don’t cry. Everything will be OK when daddy comes.”

Because it is only when human rights are protected that everyone has the chance to live with dignity and freedom.","Good morning.

It’s great to see you all today.

The UN’s theme this year - “Human Rights, Our Everyday Essentials” – couldn’t be more timely.

And it really resonates with me after my visit to Jamaica to see the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, just five short days ago.

We often speak about our basic human rights and needs in jest, but meeting a seven year old boy - who will be eight-years-old on the 28th of December - in Jamaica last week, whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Melissa and whose only Christmas wish was a working toilet, brought home to me the stark reality of millions around the world living without these essentials, whether through disaster, poverty, conflict or political oppression.

Hurricane Melissa was devastating, and I pay tribute to the Government of Jamaica and its people for their extraordinary response and resilience in the face of such hardship.

Today we reflect on how human rights are at the heart of our daily lives and when I talk about human rights, I also mean democracy and the rule of law.

The three go hand in hand.

Yet today, more and more people threaten to roll-back our hard-won freedoms.

That’s why our commitment to human rights – here at home and around the world – matter.

Not just because it’s morally and legally right, though of course it is, but because it’s in our shared interest. They allow us as individuals, as communities and as societies to thrive and prosper.

As an MP, I’ve seen people campaigning for fairness, equality and safety.

From local charities helping the homeless, to residents campaigning for clean air, to families hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees.

This is civic engagement at its best – people exercising their rights to speak out, to organise, to assemble, and to live free from discrimination.

But it’d be a mistake to think that human rights are there just to protect our freedoms.

Because they also serve our national interest, our security, our growth and our long-term prosperity.

Respect for the rule of law gives businesses confidence.

Economic and social rights help create a healthy, educated workforce.

And the right to life, freedom from torture, freedom of religion or belief and expression keep us safe.

Security and prosperity cannot be achieved without guaranteeing human rights.

How we protect rights must also evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.

We believe in the European Convention on Human Rights.

It helped create a neighbourhood of countries with a strong record on human rights, directly contributing to the peace and security Europe has enjoyed since the second world war.

It has also delivered real benefits for British people - a full inquest for the families of the Hillsborough victims, the abolition of corporal punishment in schools, and the right for gay people to serve in our armed forces.

So of course, the UK remains committed to the Convention.

At the same time, we also believe that it must evolve to face the challenges of the day.

As the Prime Minister has said, we need to modernise how it’s interpreted in the context of irregular migration.

And that work is already underway, with the Deputy Prime Minister in Strasbourg today meeting other Justice Ministers to take it forward.

But laws and conventions only matter if they make a difference to real lives.

And right now, across the world, too many lives are under attack.

Palestinians assaulted in olive groves in the West Bank.

Women in the DRC raped with impunity.

Prisoners tortured in Damascus.

Children killed by missiles in Ukraine.

And crimes in Sudan so appalling that they can be seen from satellites in space.

These are outrageous examples of tragedies, entirely inconsistent with international human rights and humanitarian law, and they are unfolding as we speak.

They remind us why we must act.

Doing nothing will only normalise impunity, making everyone, everywhere less safe.

That is why FCDO funds partners in Syria to document atrocities and build evidence to achieve accountability.

That is why we work with leaders like Nobel Laureate Dr Denis Mukwege on a survivor-centred approach when addressing sexual violence.

And that’s why the Foreign Secretary, who sends her apologies today, is personally determined to end impunity for sexual violence in conflict, pursue peace in Gaza and the West Bank, and drive urgent action in Sudan.

But we cannot do this alone.

Today as we mark the end of 16 days of Activism to End Gender-Based Violence, it is clear that we all have a role to play.

Over the last two weeks, my officials have met activists and organisations working to stop violence against women and girls in Sudan and elsewhere.

We want to do everything possible to help amplify their calls for justice and change and it makes me immensely grateful for the work you do.

Not just in responding to these issues but in raising their profile, keeping the pressure on us to act, and holding us to account to do so.

That’s why I’m concerned that civil society is under attack in so many countries because of repressive legislation.

I want to pay particular tribute to courageous human rights defenders and advocates around the world, putting their lives in danger day after day to fight for what’s right.

I’m honoured that some of them are with us today, and I look forward to hearing from them shortly.

Now, last year my predecessor set out the FCDO’s approach to human rights and governance.

I’m proud of the progress we’ve made since then and I will build on this excellent work.

We’ve strengthened the rule of law worldwide by offering free legal expertise in over 50 countries.

We’re holding war criminals to account, including for war crimes committed in Ukraine.

We helped set up the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group which supports the Ukrainian government in delivering justice.

We’re supporting the establishment for a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, and I am pleased that we formally endorsed its legal basis earlier this year.

And we’re championing equal rights for all, including through the Deputy Prime Minister’s powerful global campaign to ensure every child grows up in a safe, loving family environment.

Yet there is still so much to do.

And that’s why I’m pleased that the UK has been re-elected to serve on the UN Human Rights Council for the next two years, giving us the chance to share our experiences with others.

Now, while this is a significant opportunity, I know that many of you are concerned about cuts in our foreign aid budgets.

So I want to reassure you that we’re determined to find new innovative ways to support change on the ground, working ever more closely with local actors, focusing on impact, and publicly reporting what we do.

And all of this will be backed by a strong diplomatic network of Embassies and High Commissions who will continue to champion these agendas around the world.

And we’ll use our influence in the multilateral system to keep human rights at the heart of its work while making sure they remain the foundation of all that FCDO does.

Because it is only when human rights are protected that everyone has the chance to live with dignity and freedom. And that freedom being understood.

Thank you all.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-11 12:00:16.997621

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is a different kind of immigration agency from others in the government. It's where people go when they want to apply for asylum or get a green card or even become a citizen. But the Trump administration is now using this agency to clamp down on legal forms of migration. NPR's immigration policy reporter, Ximena Bustillo, is following this story, Hi, Ximena.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: Tell us a bit more about what this agency does compared to the other immigration agencies we've heard.

BUSTILLO: So USCIS is housed within the Homeland Security Department, and that means it's under the same department as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. But USCIS has not been responsible for making arrests, putting people in detention or facilitating deportations. They're a lot more like a customer service agency. So people come to them and say, hey, I want to apply for asylum or I want to apply for a green card, and USCIS processes those applications and decides if that person qualifies or not. Even their funding is completely different. ICE and Customs and Border Protection are funded by Congress. USCIS is actually funded by the fees people pay when they apply for these things.

DETROW: So that's the baseline, that's how the agency has been working. How has the administration changed things?

BUSTILLO: Posts on social media mostly seem to reference immigration fraud and warn immigrants that they could be deported if they commit it. The director, Joseph Edlow, has emphasized that USCIS is going to be an enforcement agency. Here he is at his Senate confirmation hearing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOSEPH EDLOW: My vision for USCIS is simple. I will restore integrity within the legal immigration system. While the whole Department of Homeland Security is working hard to make America safe again, USCIS must play as critical a role in that mission as any other immigration enforcement agency.

BUSTILLO: That rhetoric mirrors the first Trump administration, except this time they are taking it a step further.

DETROW: How so?

BUSTILLO: Well, there are reports that people are being detained at routine green card or citizenship interviews. Immigrants are afraid of engaging with the agency. Here's Eric Welsh, an immigration lawyer in California.

ERIC WELSH: I mean, No. 1 is, am I going to get arrested? No. 1 in almost every type of case, regardless of their past.

BUSTILLO: There has been a string of changes. The agency has rolled out lengthier citizenship tests. It wants to allow officers to consider immigrants' legal use of public benefits like food stamps and health care as a reason to deny legal status. The agency has also dropped the cap of refugee admissions to a historic low of 7,500. And the administration told officers that they will be revetting and reinterviewing those who were granted refugee status under the Biden administration. Then, after an Afghan national was charged in the shooting of two National Guard members, the agency put a pause on all asylum applications, and it paused all applications or approvals for green cards or citizenship, for example, from people of 19 countries on a travel ban list.

DETROW: I mean, that is a lot of drastic steps. How are people within the agency dealing with all these changes?

BUSTILLO: Across the board, employees tell me that they are honestly offended that the administration is implying that they are now enforcing immigration laws and that they weren't before. Some are quitting or taking early retirement offers. They're also feeling out of the loop. The administration terminated the union's contract, and there's been no large meetings or town halls. And that's coming from current and former employees. Workers have been asked to go back to office, but their offices were sometimes makeshift conference rooms and tables. Plus, a lot of the programs that they used to work on have been fairly inactive for most of the year.

USCIS told me that it's a priority to have safety for Americans, but it didn't respond to questions about broader concerns. And the agency is promoting some new roles - homeland defenders and special agents. It's unclear exactly what these positions are going to be responsible for, but some of the job postings specify that these positions are going to be expected to provide direct support to Border Patrol and ICE, which are arresting and deporting immigrants. So there are a lot of questions about this agency's role moving forward.

DETROW: That is NPR's immigration policy reporter, Ximena Bustillo. Thank you so much.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

Pentagon’s requested budget for 2026 indicates the Defense Department plans to spend at least $5 billion more for southern border operations alone

Warren: “It’s an insult to our service members that Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts. Stripping military resources to promote a wasteful political agenda doesn’t make our military stronger or Americans safer.”

Cover Letter to the Pentagon (PDF) | Text of Report (PDF)

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative John Garamendi (D-Calif.) released a new report detailing the Trump administration’s diversion of funds and resources from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement, and its impact on readiness and morale.

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) co-authored the report.

Under a second Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement. Senator Warren’s new report, the first detailed review of the Pentagon’s spending on immigration, found that DoD has committed at least $2 billion to support immigration enforcement through mobilizing and deploying troops to American cities and the Southern border, deporting and transporting immigrants on military aircrafts, detaining individuals on U.S. military installations, and more.

“It’s an insult to our service members that Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts. Stripping military resources to promote a wasteful political agenda doesn’t make our military stronger or Americans safer,” said Senator Warren. “Congress needs to step in and hold the Trump Administration accountable for mishandling billions of taxpayer dollars.”

“When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price. As this report shows, these disruptions come at a significant cost, in both dollars and readiness,” said Representative Garamendi.

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts in support of DHS with money allocated for other DoD projects including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” said the members.

The members’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” wrote the members. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was “understaffed because roughly half its members (were) deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse among service members, and may have even contributed to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

The report also slammed the administration’s failure to adequately inform Congress and the public about the diversion of funds. “The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” said the members.

The coalition directed follow-up questions to Secretary Hegseth about the number of troops currently supporting immigration enforcement, how long military units will be supporting DHS, and whether DHS will reimburse the military.

On Thursday, December 11, 2025, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on deployment of the National Guard across the United States.

The heightened interest in social media screening has drawn concern from immigration and free speech advocates about what the Trump administration is looking for and whether the measures target people critical of the administration in an infringement of free speech rights.","The announcement refers to travelers from more than three dozen countries who take part in the Visa Waiver Program and submit their information to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, which automatically screens them and then approves them for travel to the U.S. Unlike visa applicants, they generally do not have to go into an embassy or consulate for an interview.

DHS administers the program, which currently allows citizens of roughly 40 mostly European and Asian countries to travel to the U.S. for tourism or business for three months without visas.

The announcement also said that CBP would start requesting a list of other information, including telephone numbers the person has used over the past five years or email addresses used over the past decade. Also sought would be metadata from electronically submitted photos, as well as extensive information from the applicant’s family members, including their places of birth and their telephone numbers.

The application that people are now required to fill out to take part in ESTA asks for a more limited set of questions such as parents’ names and current email address.

The public has 60 days to comment on the proposed changes before they go into effect, the notice said.

CBP officials did not immediately respond to questions about the new rules.

The announcement did not say what the administration was looking for in the social media accounts or why it was asking for more information.

But the agency said it was complying with an executive order that Republican President Donald Trump signed in January that called for more screening of people coming to the U.S. to prevent the entry of possible national security threats.

Travelers from countries that are not part of the Visa Waiver Program system are already required to submit their social media information, a policy that dates back to the first Trump administration. The policy remained during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration.

But citizens from visa waiver countries were not obligated to do so.

Since January, the Trump administration has stepped up checks of immigrants and travelers, both those trying to enter the U.S. as well as those already in the country. Officials have tightened visa rules by requiring that applicants set all of their social media accounts to public so that they can be more easily scrutinized and checked for what authorities view as potential derogatory information. Refusing to set an account to public can be considered grounds for visa denial, according to guidelines provided by the State Department.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services now considers whether an applicant for benefits, such as a green card, “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist or antisemitic views.

Seth Moulton wants to allow people to sue federal immigration agents, introducing the cheekily named NOEM Act in Congress just a week after slamming the conditions for detainees at the ICE Boston field office.

Moulton, a North Shore Democrat who launched a primary challenge against Sen. Ed Markey, introduced the National Oversight and Enforcement of Misconduct Act, or NOEM, to amend civil rights law, his office announced Monday.

The bill would include agents from “any federal immigration enforcement authority” to a current civil rights law allowing federal litigation against state and local officials, including police officers. The amendment would target immigration agents, not all federal agents.

Currently, victims have “almost no legal recourse” against ICE agents allegedly violating their Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights of due process and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, Moulton argues.

“The NOEM Act fixes that. ICE is not above the law — and if its officers break the law, they should be held accountable in court,” Moulton said.

The Department of Homeland Security, headed by Secretary Kristi Noem, did not return a request for comment about the amendment.

In a press release, Moulton’s office also pointed to ICE agent’s “near-total immunity when they violate Americans’ rights on the street, during home raids, or in public spaces.”

Currently, people can file a lawsuit under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, where Webster Bivens sued for the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The Bivens action has also been extended to other constitutional rights, they are also limited and challenging, according to the American Immigration Council.

The Supreme Court has also curbed the Bivens path in recent years, Moulton’s office said. In 2022, the Supreme Court refused to extend the right to sue federal officers for damages under Bivens after a bed-and-breakfast owner near the Canadian border sued a federal immigration agent for violating his First and Fourth Amendment rights.",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VVL3ZW63OH47KLJZDHURIRAH2U-1-693a03a84910a-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 21:56:49.403783

In his letter to Noem, Walz said the arrests raise concerns about the due process rights of U.S citizens.

“The forcefulness, lack of communication and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota,” Walz told Noem in his letter.

Walz urged the Homeland Security secretary to find out whether agents possessed a warrant authorizing search and seizure. Any federal agents who acted unlawfully should be placed on administrative leave, Walz wrote.

The Minnesota governor, who is seeking reelection to a third term next year, also asked that Noem clarify the legal standard for citizen observing law enforcement interactions, ensure ICE agents receive clear guidance about respecting the civil rights of U.S. citizens and to “reassess the broader ‘surge’ enforcement strategy.”

The Trump administration has ramped up the presence of federal agents in Minnesota in the past two weeks. It’s unclear how many people have been detained by ICE. DHS has identified 19 people arrested by agents who are allegedly in the U.S. illegally and have criminal records.

“Our state’s safety and community trust depend not only on effective law enforcement, but on justice, fairness and respect for civil liberties,” Walz said in his letter. “We cannot allow public trust to be further damaged by detaining citizens under unclear or questionable circumstances.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-Noem-MN-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 20:56:31.945046

The program is being led by the Commerce Department, in conjunction with the departments of State and Homeland Security. Trump has credited Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick with originating the idea.

The White House has also envisioned a $5 million “Platinum Card” that would allow non-Americans to reside in the country for up to 270 days per year without paying taxes on their income outside the U.S. That plan has yet to be finalized, and Lutnick has said it would require congressional approval.

During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that ""at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.""
USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.
""USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,"" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.
""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.","The Trump administration is transforming the agency known for processing green cards and citizenship requests into one of its strongest anti-immigration policing arms.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is one of the three branches of the Homeland Security Department that deals with migration.

Traditionally, its more than 20,000 employees have focused on the various ways people can lawfully immigrate and stay in the U.S. — be that applying for asylum, a green card, citizenship, work visa, or another legal pathway.

Since January, administration officials have taken an axe to that traditional mission by encouraging early retirements, shuttering collective bargaining agreements and drastically cutting back on programs that facilitate legal migration. New job postings lean into the rhetoric of hiring ""homeland defenders"" and tackling fraud.

During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that ""at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.""

The efforts come as President Trump seeks to curb illegal immigration but also reduce legal ways to get to the U.S. and stay here, especially for certain nationalities.

It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.

With the recent changes, at least 1,300 people took the ""Fork in the Road"" resignation offer for federal employees, while others have left on their own. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees were not allowed to take the offer.)

And it's catching immigrants and their families, lawyers and advocates off guard.

""'Am I going to get arrested?' … That's a question, regardless of their past,"" said Eric Welsh, an immigration attorney in California who helps his clients apply for various USCIS programs.

""There really is a lot more fear and there is a lot more concern about, should we do it at all?,"" Welsh said, about people applying for legal status.

Rapid changes after deadly shooting

The changes have been rapid. In recent weeks, the White House said it would re-review all approved refugee claims under the Biden administration.

After an Afghan national was charged for shooting two National Guard members in late November, the administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, and ordered retroactive reviews of already-approved applications.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,"" Trump wrote on social media after the shooting. ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.

""USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,"" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.

""Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.""

Recent policies come after a swath of other changes this year. Policy memos have emphasized that the priority for refugees is admitting those who can easily assimilate into the country, with the target demographic being white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The White House also capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest since the modern refugee program started in the 1980s.

The agency has unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.

Reports of arrests and detention following routine USCIS interviews and appointments have increased fear among immigrants.

""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. ""That's a pretty different stance towards immigration than we've seen over recent decades.""

In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.

""Some people, if they have a green card, might just wait to naturalize and see if they can wait for a new administration,"" Gelatt said.

USCIS leans into enforcement and policing tactics

The new administration has prioritized the agency's law enforcement work.

For example, USCIS has promoted a new role: ""homeland defenders.""

It is unclear exactly what these positions are responsible for. USCIS said they will be ""interviewing aliens, reviewing applications, and identifying criminal or ineligible aliens.""

The posting also specifies this position is expected to provide direct support to CBP and ICE, two agencies leading the effort to arrest, detain and deport immigrants.

The roles also seem to cater to those with backgrounds in traditional law enforcement, contrary to a background in immigration law and administrative government work that is more typical for USCIS.

USCIS said it received some 35,000 applications for the role of ""homeland defender"" and has made ""hundreds"" of job offers, including to former law enforcement officials and veterans, according to a November USCIS press release.

""USCIS is cutting bureaucratic red tape to hire fiercely dedicated, America-first patriots to serve on the frontlines and hold the line against terrorists, criminal aliens, and bad actors intent on infiltrating our nation,"" the release stated.

It also created USCIS special agents, who have law enforcement authority to carry firearms, and investigate, arrest and prosecute immigration cases. In the past, much of this would be the work of ICE or CBP, according to the release announcing the new workforce.

""Certainly the immigration enforcement side of things that are happening has sent a message that anybody who isn't a citizen in the United States could be arrested and put into ICE detention and potentially deported,"" Gelatt said. ""That has a real chilling effect on people's willingness to interact with the government generally, and with USCIS as well.""

USCIS workers defend past enforcement

The changes are having an impact inside the agency, as workers feel out of the loop about the direction and pace of changes.

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees. He says morale is some of the lowest he's seen in his tenure, thanks to the termination of the union contract, a haphazard back-to-office mandate that has employees working in makeshift desks, and a lack of communication from agency leadership.

""There are questions about what will be our mission, what will be our focus? And to that extent, we are alarmed by rhetoric,"" Knowles said. He said the agency has always enforced the nation's immigration laws when it processes applications.

One USCIS refugee officer who recently departed the agency after nearly a decade said the speed of the changes ""overwhelmed"" employees, and recent changes were the last straw. The person spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retaliation from the agency they hope to return to.

USCIS staffers say they have always worked hard to ensure people don't get benefits they do not qualify for, and also look for people who may be breaking the law.

So employees were upset by the administration's implication that they hadn't been doing their jobs properly for the last five years, after the White House announced all refugees admitted under in the Biden era must be reinterviewed.

""It's going to cause a lot of confusion. It's going to cause a lot of chaos. It's going to cost a lot of money,"" the employee said. ""It seems impossible.""

USCIS said it has paused the approvals while it ""works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.

Not ""an adversarial office""

Beyond policy and rhetoric changes, there's been subtler signs of transformation.

Signs inside USCIS offices urge people to leave the country, mirroring the tone of a detention center, rather than that of an immigration office, according to Welsh and other lawyers.

""USCIS is not designed to be an adversarial office,"" he said. ""They're not the enforcers. They're not looking to reduce.""

Now, he said, his clients are concerned with needing to have proof of a good moral character by providing church attendance or charitable donation history, for example.

""It's now certainly not the kind of friendly atmosphere that we used to experience with the agency,"" Welsh said.

Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.

""We have borders and we have benefits. So for people who deserve them or people who have earned them for various reasons, we provide them,"" Welsh said. ""If we just go into a pure enforcement mindset, then there's no happy place to be.""

The agency did not respond to a question about whether immigrants will be deterred from pursuing legal pathways to permanent status.

""The safety of the American people always come [sic] first,"" the agency said in its statement.

After the January fires, thousands of Southern Californians suddenly faced having to apply for FEMA assistance and battle insurance companies to rebuild what was lost.

Faculty, students and volunteers at Pepperdine University were on the ground within days of the Eaton and Palisades fires offering free legal assistance and relaunching the Disaster Relief Clinic, which provided pro bono services after the Thomas and Woolsey fires in 2017 and 2018.

Since then, Pepperdine Caruso School of Law's Disaster Relief Clinic has assisted more than 300 fire survivors, according to the university. The clinic has helped recover at least $750,000 in FEMA assistance and millions more from insurance claims.

“We provide really good legal help for people that have been damaged by the fire[s],” David A. DeJute, the clinic’s director, told LAist. “It makes me feel like I'm providing something of value and worth back to the community.”

About the clinic

The clinic is designed to help fire survivors with a wide variety of legal issues they may face as they go through the recovery and rebuilding process, including having to find rental housing, working with remediation companies to clean up ash and navigating insurance policy limits.

DeJute, who’s also an adjunct professor with Pepperdine’s law school, said the weeks after the fires were a “little like triage” as the clinic focused on helping people prioritize their next steps.

“When you have someone in your family die, you experience trauma and shock and remorse, and nobody is surprised that it affects your mood and your ability to process information,” he said. “Same thing happens when you've lost your home.”

DeJute said some of the most common legal issues that come up at the clinic have to do with FEMA applications, landlords and price gouging.

If a survivor needs more help than the clinic can handle, like with litigation, it will refer them to other lawyers who’ve agreed to take clients pro bono, according to Pepperdine.

The clinic also has trained around 600 lawyers to bring free legal services to their own communities after a disaster, according to the university. DeJute said that includes a student who stepped in to help after the deadly flash flooding in Texas this summer.

A survivor’s story

Pergrin Jung’s family home was “completely destroyed” in the Palisades Fire in what he described to LAist as “the worst days of our lives.”

Jung, like many other survivors, wasn’t sure how to start picking up the pieces.

“Not only were we in a state of shock,” he said. “But also, none of us really knew what the next steps would be.”

Jung reached out for help with an insurance claim for his homeowner’s policy and said the clinic was a “staple” every step of the way. He said students and staff helped explain the legal system, gave feedback on letters he sent to the insurance company and guided his strategy throughout the process.

“Having this resource made all the difference to us,” Jung said. “They were invaluable.”

Resources for fire survivors

You can learn about the Disaster Relief Clinic here.

You can find wildfire community resources from Pepperdine University here.

Educational experience

The clinic is run by Pepperdine faculty, staff and law students who get hands-on experience operating as attorneys under DeJute’s supervision.

The students are tasked with communicating with clients, diving into details of their legal needs, pushing back against price gouging and managing issues with mortgage companies, to name a few.

Taylor Wedlock, a third-year law student, said the clinic was an opportunity to do her part for the community, especially after her father, an L.A. fire captain, spent about a week fighting the Palisades Fire.

“We weren't just doing FEMA appeals or applications,” she told LAist. “We're going to … help to get this survivor his instruments back so he can so he can start his, you know, his musical career again.”

Wedlock said the clinic helps students apply what they learn in law school textbooks and lectures while exploring the more personal aspect of being a lawyer.

Wedlock recalled the relief in her client’s voice when she got approved for FEMA rental assistance after more than six months of denials, for example. She said she considers that one of her major wins of the semester.

“It may seem impossible to come back from such devastation, but there are options,” Wedlock said. “There are a lot of people who are willing to help.”

Mubashir, a U.S. citizen, was on lunch break from his job when ICE agents arrived to arrest him. According to Mubashir, he was slammed to the ground and put into a chokehold.

“I told him, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen, what is going on?'” Mubashir said. “He didn’t seem to care.”

He added that the agent never identified himself as an ICE agent.

“I felt like I was getting assaulted, like I was getting kidnapped,” Mubashir said.

The agent put Mubashir into a squad, where he said ICE needed to verify that Mubashir was a citizen, and, after several failed attempts to scan his face and fingerprints, brought him to the detention center at the Bishop Henry Whipple federal building.

At one point, a man approached the squad with a copy of Mubashir’s passport. But the ICE agent said that Mubashir would still be detained.

Mubashir said he requested water and medical assistance, but was denied water and told there weren’t any medical personnel at the facility.

Finally, Mubashir was given his phone to pull up his identification, and was let go after agents scanned his fingerprints.

When he asked agents to drop him off at the location where he was detained, Mubashir said the agents told him he had to walk home in the snow.

“I asked three times, they said, ‘No, you’re walking,'” Mubashir said. “Eventually, my parents came and picked me up.”

Both Frey and O’Hara condemned the incident.

Frey called out the ICE agents involved for their violence and unwillingness to believe that Mubashir is a citizen.

O’Hara added that city leaders don’t object to lawful arrests, but hope that the arrests can be well-planned for the safety of everybody. He also pointed to stories of ICE agents using what are “at the very least, questionable methods and a use of resources that doesn’t appear to be getting a return on investment,” referencing the detainment of U.S. citizens.

Governor Tim Walz announced Wednesday that he has sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, urging her to review and respond to the arrest of multiple U.S. citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis.

“The forcefulness, lack of communication, and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota,” the letter begins.

Walz referenced the arrests of Susan Tincher and Mubashir — both U.S. citizens. Tincher was acting as a “citizen observer” of ICE arrests when she was arrested.

Huffman released the following statement: “The Trump administration is completely off the rails – launching ruthless attacks in the Caribbean, escalating military tensions in Venezuela, and selling out Ukraine.
Our defense budget is meant to boost military readiness, benefit service members, and help protect our national security – not write a blank check to the Trump administration to wreak any havoc they please.

Denies IVF access to military families: Excludes a provision that would have extended fertility-treatment coverage to all service members.","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) voted against advancing the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) out of the House. In addition to exceeding the overall budget by $8 billion and promoting a series of harmful provisions, the legislation lacks any substantial guardrails to curb the authoritarian agenda of this out-of-control administration. In response to the legislation, Rep. Huffman released the following statement:

“The Trump administration is completely off the rails – launching ruthless attacks in the Caribbean, escalating military tensions in Venezuela, and selling out Ukraine. They’re running amok, and Congressional Republicans are doing nothing to rein them in. Our defense budget is meant to boost military readiness, benefit service members, and help protect our national security – not write a blank check to the Trump administration to wreak any havoc they please. But that’s exactly what the NDAA does, which is why I could not vote in good conscience to advance this bill,” said Rep. Huffman.

“This year’s NDAA opens the door for Trump and his sycophants to strip away civil rights, act without congressional oversight, and create even more of a mess of our immigration system. The NDAA continues to allow the Trump admin to hand over our public lands to Border Patrol agents and rewrites key environmental safeguards, clearing the way for them to push their inhumane agenda with virtually no oversight.

“Because of this bill, our brave service members will be completely abandoned and treated with zero humanity. Now, they can be discriminated against based on their race or identity. Republicans are not only making it harder for diverse Americans to serve our country, but they’re also throwing a wrench in military readiness and recruitment in the process.

“While ultimately I could not vote to support their political culture wars, damage to our military, and relentless environmental attacks, I was happy we could negotiate to get federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina—it's been a long time coming and an important step forward in our work to support tribal sovereignty.

“But at the end of the day, this legislation does way more harm than good, and I can’t support something that enables Trump to do any and everything he wants, no matter the cost to our service members, public lands, or innocent people around the world,” he concluded.

Some of the harmful provisions Huffman opposed in the final passage of the NDAA include:

Gives a Blank Check to Trump with Minimal Constraints: The FY26 NDAA doesn’t force any truly meaningful oversight or restraints on Trump, despite severe overreaches and abuses of power that have become a hallmark of this administration. While it has minor provisions to fence funding until the Secretary of Defense provides Congress unedited videos of strikes in Latin America, require explanations for removals of general offices, and more transparency on the use of military aircraft for immigration enforcement, the efforts stop there and completely fail to meet the serious overreaches by the Trump administration.

Clears the way for Trump’s Abuse of Public Lands: Expands the Department of Defense (DoD)’s authority to support Border Patrol operations, enabling the administration to further militarize and weaponize public lands for its oppressive border-enforcement agenda.

Fuels Discrimination: Prohibits the DoD from offering any DEI-related training programs and developing any reports on topics that are related, or perceived to be related to, DEI. The bill also prohibits transgender athletes enrolled at the military services academies from competing in women’s sports.

Supports the White Christian Nationalism Agenda: Excludes provision protecting collective bargaining rights for the DoD’s civilian employees. It also excludes a provision addressing the renaming of military installations and bases after Confederates.

Locks in Trump’s Extreme Border Agenda: Codifies the administration’s self-declared border “emergency” declaration, granting expanded authority to escalate the militarization at the southern border.

Denies IVF access to military families: Excludes a provision that would have extended fertility-treatment coverage to all service members.

“Congress needs to step in and hold the Trump Administration accountable for mishandling billions of taxpayer dollars.” “When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price.
Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.
“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer.
The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies.","Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative John Garamendi (D-Calif.) released a new report detailing the Trump administration’s diversion of funds and resources from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement, and its impact on readiness and morale.

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) co-authored the report.

Under a second Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement. Senator Warren’s new report, the first detailed review of the Pentagon’s spending on immigration, found that DoD has committed at least $2 billion to support immigration enforcement through mobilizing and deploying troops to American cities and the Southern border, deporting and transporting immigrants on military aircrafts, detaining individuals on U.S. military installations, and more.

“It’s an insult to our service members that Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts. Stripping military resources to promote a wasteful political agenda doesn’t make our military stronger or Americans safer,” said Senator Warren. “Congress needs to step in and hold the Trump Administration accountable for mishandling billions of taxpayer dollars.”

“When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price. As this report shows, these disruptions come at a significant cost, in both dollars and readiness,” said Representative Garamendi.

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts in support of DHS with money allocated for other DoD projects including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” said the members.

The members’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” wrote the members. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was “understaffed because roughly half its members [were] deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse among service members, and may have even contributed to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

The report also slammed the administration’s failure to adequately inform Congress and the public about the diversion of funds. “The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” said the members.

The coalition directed follow-up questions to Secretary Hegseth about the number of troops currently supporting immigration enforcement, how long military units will be supporting DHS, and whether DHS will reimburse the military.

On Thursday, December 11, 2025, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on deployment of the National Guard across the United States.

December 10, 2025

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation on Tuesday terminated senior management of its economic development corporation after a tribal subsidiary secured a $29.9 million federal contract to design potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

The prime contract, awarded by the Department of Homeland Security to KPB Services LLC, supports early-phase planning, including research, technical assessments and concept designs for secure structures that meet ICE operating requirements. The award does not involve construction or the operation of detention centers, according to federal procurement documents.

In a joint statement, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Prairie Band LLC acknowledged community concerns about the Homeland Security contract and the process that led to its approval.

“Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Prairie Band LLC understand the concerns raised about a recently awarded Department of Homeland Security planning contract that involves feasibility studies and technical assessments,” the statement said. “As a sovereign Nation, our values guide the decisions we make, and we acknowledge that this contract does not align with those principles.”

The Tribal Council and the board of Prairie Band LLC said they terminated senior members of the LLC’s leadership team responsible for securing the award.

“Moving forward, we are also taking a closer look at the internal review and approval process for federal contracts,” the statement said, adding that new safeguards and reporting requirements will be implemented to prevent similar issues.

“We recognize the weight this news carries for so many, as well as the feelings of anger, confusion and disappointment it caused. We hear those concerns,” the Nation said. “As a Nation, we take seriously our responsibility to ensure all future engagements align clearly with our values and mission.”

KPB Services was registered in April by Prairie Band LLC Executive Vice President Ernest Woodward as part of the corporation’s broader strategy to enter federal procurement markets. The firm had positioned itself to pursue planning and technical support contracts across multiple agencies, though the specific ICE-related work drew immediate backlash from tribal citizens once details became public.

The Prairie Band contract reflects a broader pattern of Native entities securing federal immigration work. Alaska Native Corporations have held hundreds of millions of dollars in ICE contracts over the past decade, including detention facility operations, guard services and border patrol support.

NANA Regional Corporation, one of Alaska's largest Alaska Native Corporations, has faced criticism over its growing role in immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration. Other Alaska Native Corporations, including subsidiaries of Bering Straits Native Corporation and Ahtna Inc., have operated ICE detention facilities in Texas and California. Doyon Ltd. previously held Homeland Security contracts but exited that work about a decade ago.

Prairie Band LLC, wholly owned by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, oversees businesses in construction, professional services and government contracting. The $29.9 million award is among the largest federal contracts received by a Prairie Band enterprise and reflects a growing tribal presence in sectors historically dominated by private firms.

Tribal officials said revenue from federal contracts supports government programs, economic development and long-term financial growth for the Nation, but emphasized that future opportunities must advance — not conflict with — the Nation’s core values.

Brian Edwards provided additional reporting.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect Doyon Ltd.'s exited contracts with Homeland Security about a decade ago.

About a dozen foreign-born students at Vermont State University in Castleton took turns reading passages from an essay about the rise of online shopping.

Eighteen-year-old Heidi Perez focused intently on a printed copy she held with both hands, impressing her professor with her crisp elocution as she read aloud about statistical shifts in consumer behavior.

The first-year students were learning English as a second language as part of their college coursework. The daughter of migrant farmworkers from Chiapas, Mexico, Perez’s path to that classroom had been more circuitous than that of most of her peers.

On June 14, agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection smashed the window of a vehicle Perez was traveling in, arresting her and her stepfather. They were in Richford, delivering food to the homes of migrant farmworkers.

The young woman who’d graduated from Milton High School a few days prior would spend the next four weeks in a cell at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington.

Hundreds of Vermonters rallied for their release outside a federal court building in Burlington in July. A few days later, an immigration judge granted them bond, freeing Perez to become the first person in her family to attend college, even as the case against her is still pending.

She’s experienced the first-year jitters that most new college students contend with.

“I’m used to living with my family, and it’s all pretty new. When I got here I felt a little confused, a little out of place,” said Perez, who spoke to Vermont Public through an interpreter.

But she’s had to manage an additional stress that other students do not.

“Before the detention happened I felt really safe here. I hadn’t heard about many detentions,” Perez said. “After the detention, obviously things changed for the worse.”

'On a knife's edge'

Perez came to Vermont from Chiapas in 2022 when she was 15 years old to reunite with her mom, who had arrived five years earlier to work on a dairy farm. She’s part of a recent trend that’s seen more and more child immigrants travel to Vermont to join their parents.

No state or federal agency keeps reliable data on the number of undocumented children in Vermont. The advocacy organization Migrant Justice says the number of children of undocumented Latin American immigrants is probably somewhere in the high hundreds.

As federal immigration authorities arrest an unprecedented number of people in Vermont — more than 100 over the past 10 months — that has altered the daily reality not just for parents but for the children that followed them here.

Yesenia is a single mom from Tabasco, Mexico, who moved to Vermont in 2017 so she could better provide for her two kids back home. Vermont Public is using only her first name because her immigration status puts her at risk of deportation.

“There wasn’t a way to make ends meet, and they needed things,” she said through an interpreter. “So this was the way to make enough money that I would be able to send back so they would have the things they needed.”

About three years ago, her children, now 14 and 18, traveled to Vermont to be with her. The family lives in a small house near the dairy farm where Yesenia feeds calves, and they attend local public schools. Yesenia’s daughter has been accepted into an architecture program at Norwich University.

But the heightened threat of deportation has cast a shadow over their new lives here.

“We just sort of feel like we’re on a knife’s edge right now, and that anything could happen,” Yesenia said. “We talk about what it would be like to go back to Mexico, but it’s not like things are going so great there. And if they want an education, I mean, here’s the place to do it. Like, I don’t think that they would be able to have the same future in Mexico that they could have here.”

Pushing for change

The fact that such a future, however tenuous, exists in Vermont can be traced to the efforts of immigrant workers themselves, including Heidi Perez.

Last year she traveled to the Statehouse multiple times to urge lawmakers to make residents of Vermont eligible for in-state tuition rates, and need-based financial aid, regardless of their immigration status.

“I explained why education is so important, why I wanted to study, why that opportunity meant so much,” Perez said. “And we just kept coming back again and again and talking to the legislators and eventually we won.”

She’s acutely aware of the significance of what that achievement means for her community.

“Before, young people would come here only to work. Why? Because they didn’t know they could study here in Vermont,” Perez said over breakfast at the Castleton cafeteria. “But now, because as a community we organized and we won the right to education, now we know we can do that.”

But whether Perez herself will be able to take advantage of the education she fought for now hinges on the outcome of her pending immigration case. While a judge granted Perez bond, federal authorities are still pursuing their case against her.

She’s accused of a civil immigration offense. For that, the federal government wants her deported from the United States. ■",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9048d49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F38%2Fc139fa7549e385ff311e6f5a596a%2Fimmigrant-workers-heidi3-palumbo-20251114-11.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:57:24.968275

The military budget is nearly $900 billion a year.
“The Pentagon is able to execute on many missions at the same time,” said Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
According to the report, the Pentagon expects to account for border operations in its next budget, instead of taking funds from other projects authorized by Congress.
The Defense Department’s spending on immigration operations is set to more than double next year, to $5 billion.","A group of Democratic lawmakers said in a report released on Wednesday that the Pentagon had diverted at least $2 billion from its core missions this year to support the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The report found that shifting the funds had led to the pausing or canceling of programs, including the building of a pilot training facility, the repairing of schools for children of service members and the refurbishment of military barracks, something Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called a priority.

The report says that military readiness “will suffer as a direct result of diverting” Pentagon resources for immigration missions that are “not consistent” with the military’s mission and that troops “have neither signed up nor been trained for.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the administration was “using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts.”

The report cited as an example funds that had been allocated for building a jet-aircraft training facility in Mississippi and barracks for troops on overseas bases. The money was “reprogrammed” to build just 20 miles of President Trump’s wall along the southern border, lawmakers said.

The Defense Department defended its use of resources to back Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, saying in a statement that it could do so without undercutting other priorities. The military budget is nearly $900 billion a year.

“The Pentagon is able to execute on many missions at the same time,” said Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokeswoman.

She added: “Spending allocated money on one mission does not mean other missions become depleted.”

It is unclear, the report says, whether the Department of Homeland Security has reimbursed the Defense Department for any of the military’s spending on immigration operations.

Earlier this year, Congress provided Mr. Trump with $170 billion over four years, mostly for the Department of Homeland Security, to back his immigration policies. In the process, the annual budget of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, jumped from $8 billion to approximately $28 billion, making it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Using military assets for immigration missions, including housing migrants in detention and using Air Force cargo aircraft for deportation flights, has proved more costly than when the same functions are performed by civil authorities, the report said.

The report, citing a deportation flight from El Paso, Texas, to Guatemala shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, found that the use of military aircraft costs taxpayers approximately three times more than flights made by civilian aircraft chartered by ICE.

In February, the administration began using the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to house migrants designated for deportation from the United States — but only intermittently.

The effects of federalizing National Guard soldiers and airmen and sending them on missions directed by the White House has had a negative effect on the ability of state governors to perform emergency services closer to home, the report said.

Lawmakers noted that in June, the California National Guard’s firefighting unit only had half of its assigned soldiers ahead of peak wildfire season, after the president sent many of its members to Los Angeles to assist ICE.

According to the report, the Pentagon expects to account for border operations in its next budget, instead of taking funds from other projects authorized by Congress. The Defense Department’s spending on immigration operations is set to more than double next year, to $5 billion.

The exact number of American troops deployed to the southern border is unclear, but is likely at least 8,500. U.S. Northern Command, which oversees that mission, has said that active-duty forces will remain at the border “until complete operational control of the southern border is achieved.”

Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.

The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.

Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn’t previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.

“This is a big win for the rule of law,” Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. “Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.”

The lawsuit is one piece of Kobach’s broad range of anti-immigration efforts. He helped Kansas earlier this year become one of the first states in the country to deputize state law enforcement agents to enforce immigration law.

He is party to another lawsuit that seeks to exclude certain immigrants from U.S. Census counts. Kobach argued counting people in the country without particular documentation or with temporary visas skews congressional district apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of “the whole number of persons in each state” every 10 years.

He also spent years defending anti-immigration ordinances on behalf of cities, and, as a law professor, he helped craft controversial legislation in Arizona.

Relocate migrants or pay for support EU states finalized one plan that analyst Helena Hahn sees as somewhat bucking the trend toward more restrictions.
Far-right parties which focus on anti-immigrant messaging are gaining popularity in many EU countries, with centrist forces trying to claw back votes.","If you read Washington's latest security strategy slamming European migration policies and claiming the continent faces ""civilisational erasure,"" you might think the EU was throwing its borders wide open.

In fact, irregular migration to the bloc is falling, and EU states just advanced their most restrictive migration rules yet in a bid to make it easier for members to swiftly detain and deport rejected asylum seekers.

Denmark's Immigration Minister Rasmus Stoklund said new reforms would help fix a ""dysfunctional"" EU system and restore a sense of ""control.""

But the moves have also drawn stark criticism from human rights watchdogs, with Amnesty accusing the bloc of mirroring the ""harrowing, dehumanizing and unlawful mass arrests, detention and deportations in the US.""

Sending migrants to overseas detention centers?

The raft of reforms backed by EU home affairs ministers on Monday includes a legal rubber-stamp on the idea of so-called ""return hubs."" That could mean detention centers outside the EU where migrants may be sent to have asylum claims processed — or even as part of a one-way ticket out from Europe.

The rule rewrite, which still needs to be negotiated with the European Parliament, would allow individual EU governments to strike up deals with states beyond the bloc's borders and send migrants there — even if they have no ties to the country.

While Denmark began mulling ways to send migrants to Rwanda back in 2021, the first EU member to try it out in practice was Italy. It set up centers in its non-EU neighbor Albania last year, but Rome's hubs were beset by legal challenges and put on hold.

Italy's interior minister said on Monday that agreement among ministers leaves Albania-based centers well-positioned to become the first real-world example of an EU return hub and to ""resume"" operations.

But migration policy analyst Helena Hahn said the ""jury is still out"" on what return hubs could look like beyond Italy's model — and above all, which non-EU states would be willing to host migrants bound for Europe.

'Shirking responsibility?'

Charities and campaigners including Human Rights Watch and Oxfam have in the past slammed the EU for ""shirking responsibility"" by trying to outsource asylum processing.

""The EU is attempting to further push its responsibilities onto countries who already host the majority of refugees with often far fewer resources,"" dozens of NGOs said last year.

Their statement insisted EU pledges to uphold migrants' rights were ""empty words.""

Denmark's Stoklund pushed back on those accusations on Monday. ""If we send someone to a return center, we will be responsible for respecting their human rights,"" he told reporters after talks in Brussels.

Faster deportations by designating 'safe' countries

EU states also backed new proposals designed to speed up deportations, with harsher penalties for migrants who ignore expulsion orders. That follows an earlier agreement on EU plans to downgrade trade ties with countries which fail to cooperate on deportations.

Ministers also gave a green light to a centralized list of ""safe"" countries which national authorities can use to fast-track decisions and deny residency to those least likely to be granted asylum.

Only around 4% of Bangladeshis seeking asylum in the EU last year were accepted, for example, and Bangladesh heads up the list of countries deemed safe by Brussels. Other states on the list include India, Colombia, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.

Ministers agreed EU candidate states such as Montenegro, Moldova or Serbia should also be deemed safe, except in cases of conflict or restrictions on fundamental rights.

Relocate migrants or pay for support

EU states finalized one plan that analyst Helena Hahn sees as somewhat bucking the trend toward more restrictions.

The so-called ""solidarity pool"" will see member states from Europe's North and East either take in more migrants from Southern states where most asylum seekers arrive — or pay into a funding pot to support the likes of Cyprus, Spain, Italy or Greece.

Hahn describes this as ""a mechanism to organize and to coordinate responsibility sharing over asylum seekers amongst member states"" — and she thinks it's a ""big step.""

""Questions around relocations, quotas, the distribution of asylum seekers across Europe in a 'fair' way has always been — for the longest amount of time now — one of the main political sensitivities, in particular, that have plagued the implementation and functioning of the common European asylum system,"" she explained.

Details of which countries will pay what remain under wraps, but EU member Hungary has already vowed not to follow the rules — something which could tee up future legal clashes between Brussels and Budapest.

Voter concerns and a surging far right

EU citizens often cite irregular immigration as one of their top concerns. Bloc-wide survey data from earlier this year saw people rank it second only to Russia's war in Ukraine in a list of the biggest challenges facing the EU — ahead of the cost of living, climate change, and security and defense issues.

Far-right parties which focus on anti-immigrant messaging are gaining popularity in many EU countries, with centrist forces trying to claw back votes.

""We are looking at a largely restrictive immigration agenda,"" researcher Helena Hahn told DW, noting more and more countries are trying to come up with so-called ""innovative solutions"" to deter, detain and deport migrants.

""But we have seen very few outcomes so far,"" Hahn explained. ""So that also, I think, speaks to the political feasibility of some of these ideas that seem to suggest that it would be quite easy to move people from A to B, without any particular kind of respect to political, diplomatic or practical considerations.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep Judy Chu (CA-28), Senator Mazie Hirono (HI) reintroduced the Reuniting Families Act of 2025. This legislation would strengthen protections for immigrant families and address long-standing problems in a family immigration system that hasn’t seen meaningful reform in more than three decades.

Today, nearly four million people with approved visa applications remain trapped in a massive immigration backlog, with many waiting more than a decade to reunite with their loved ones. This crisis is the direct result of an outdated system that has not seen meaningful reform for more than thirty years. The Reuniting Families Act tackles these delays by recapturing unused visas, rolling them into future years, expanding who qualifies as a family member to include permanent partners, and increasing both the total number of available family preference visas and per-country limits.

The individuals stuck in these backlogs have approved applications and are ready to contribute to our communities and strengthen the American economy. No one, regardless of where they come from, should be forced to wait decades to reunite with family or begin building a life in the United States. We need a system that is safer, more efficient, and better equipped to uphold both America’s security and its commitment to humanity.

This bill tackles several major challenges within the immigration system. Among the key improvements are:

More than doubling number of available family preference visas

Raising existing per-country yearly visa limits, so the wait is not so long for countries with high levels of migration

Setting an absolute time limit on visa processing, so no applicant has to wait more than 10 years for a visa if they have an approved application

""Family-based immigration makes our country stronger. But our broken immigration system is preventing individuals from reuniting with their loved ones and contributing to our communities and economies. With over four million individuals with approved visa applications stuck in limbo through no fault of their own, families are needlessly suffering,” said Rep. Chu. “That’s why I am proud to reintroduce the commonsense Reuniting Families Act of 2025 with Senator Hirono to ensure that no one should have to wait years, sometimes decades, to reunite with a loved one and to ensure our family-based immigration system works more efficiently and humanely.”

“Immigrant families currently experience unnecessary obstacles and delays due to our country’s broken immigration system, keeping families separated for potentially long periods of time,” said Senator Hirono. “By reducing family-based immigration backlogs and making common sense updates to how we treat families, the Reuniting Families Act will help take the first step in the right direction to keeping families together as they navigate our immigration system.”

“Asian Americans Advancing Justice is proud to support Rep. Judy Chu’s reintroduction of the Reuniting Families Act (RFA), which will make it easier for immigrant families to reunite through a family-based immigration system. Family-based immigration has been the cornerstone of the United States for decades, laying the foundation for immigrant communities, including Asian Americans, to settle down and contribute to our nation’s vibrant social and economic fabric,” said Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a network of four independent Asian American civil rights organizations. “However, our immigration system has broken down without a fix for over thirty years, keeping families separated with millions of people stuck in backlogs abroad. Families have the right to be together and should not have to spend decades apart. This bill is a beacon of hope to make our immigration system more humane, and it is a meaningful step toward bringing loved ones back together.”

""Fifty years ago, millions of Southeast Asian families were forced to flee war and genocide in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, separated from their loved ones in order to survive. Today, our backlogged family immigration system continues to keep Southeast Asian American families apart, and that backlog has only continued to grow for our communities as this Administration prevents immigration from Laos,” said Quyen Dinh, Executive Director of the Southeast Asian Resource Action Center (SEARAC). “The Reuniting Families Act (RFA) restores compassion to our immigration system by preventing families from waiting decades to reunite and expanding relief for those facing deportation. As families across the country continue to be torn apart by this administration’s cruel immigration enforcement policies, we applaud Rep. Judy Chu for her leadership and commitment to keeping families whole. SEARAC is committed to working alongside Rep. Chu and our partners to ensure all families have the opportunity to reunite with their loved ones and heal.”

""In a time when immigrant families are facing unprecedented levels of cruelty and family separation, we urgently need legislation like the Reuniting Families Act (RFA) to reform our inefficient and inhumane immigration system,"" said Angelica Salas, Executive Director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA). ""For decades, we have endured the repercussions of this broken immigration system, which includes a significant backlog of family visas. CHIRLA welcomes the RFA, as it recognizes that family unity lies at the core of our immigration system and that immigrants are human beings who contribute to and strengthen our nation.""

""The Reuniting Families Act (RFA) directly addresses the needs of our communities by ensuring that family members are not subjected to extensive and often distressing visa processing delays,” said Nils Kinuani, Federal Policy Manager of African Communities Together (ACT). “By streamlining the family-based immigration system, this bill facilitates the quicker reunification of families, which is vital for both the individuals involved and the broader community.""

Read Mirsy's Impactful story

Mirsy Alva-Lopez came to the United States in 2018 from Guatemala because she wanted to give her children a dignified and safe future. So you can imagine her horror when she was detained at the U.S.-Mexico border, where immigration officials tore her apart from her 3-year-old son and placed him in government custody.

Mirsy grappled with the constant fear, trauma, and heartbreak of having limited knowledge about her son’s whereabouts or well-being. They were one of many thousands of families separated under the first Trump administration’s unconscionable Zero Tolerance policy.

With the tireless advocacy from the Young Center and partner organizations, Mirsy and her son were finally reunited after four painful months. Years later, when the HMs. L v. ICE class action lawsuit filed on behalf of separated families like Mirsy’s was settled, Mirsy won the right to apply for certain types of immigration status so she and her children could remain in the United States, safe and reunited.

This past summer, however, Mirsy was caught in the second Trump administration’s interior enforcement dragnet while going to work in Florida. Even after presenting documentation of her lawful status, Mirsy was detained by ICE agents. In less than a week, she was illegally deported to Guatemala. Once again, Mirsy was separated from her children and forced to relive the worst moment of her life.

Because she could not bear to be separated from her children again, Mirsy arranged for them to say goodbye to their friends and school community in the United States and travel to Guatemala to be with her. But her children had not lived there in seven years—Guatemala didn’t feel like home.

That’s why the Young Center and partner organizations advocated for Mirsy and her children to be able to return to the United States. Though the government agreed to allow them to return, it has been slow to act and over five months have passed since Mirsy was deported.

In the years after their initial separation, Mirsy’s son often expressed fear that his mother would be taken from him or that she wouldn’t return. Under the current administration, that fear became a reality.

Every family deserves safety, belonging, and hope. This Human Rights Day—and every day—we stand with immigrant families, like Mirsy’s. Help us raise our voices for justice.

While the document is mainly concerned with the United States’ international posture and defensive capabilities, it also addressed the significance of strong borders, emphasizing the connection between border security and national security. FAIR has been proud to support the administration’s pro-enforcement agenda and encourages further action to safeguard our borders and enforce our laws.

In declaring an end to the “Era of Mass Migration,” the White House paper uncompromisingly lays out the importance of strong borders to national sovereignty:

In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion, distorted labor markets, and undermined national security. The era of mass migration must end. Border security is the primary element of national security. We must protect our country from invasion, not just from unchecked migration but from cross-border threats such as terrorism, drugs, espionage, and human trafficking. A border controlled by the will of the American people as implemented by their government is fundamental to the survival of the United States as a sovereign republic.

The administration has achieved rapid success in shutting down illegal crossings and quickly ramping up removals, reversing four years of disastrous anti-borders policies. Congress has supported this agenda by passing a FAIR-supported reconciliation bill containing billions of dollars for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for border security and immigration enforcement. In contrast, under the Biden administration’s failed policies, violent criminals and transnational gang members flooded American communities and more than 10 million illegal aliens crossed our borders, including nearly two million special interest aliens potentially posing national security threats.

Beyond the broad effects, as FAIR demonstrated in a recent report, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also took advantage of the Biden administration’s border crisis. Over 182,000 Chinese nationals were encountered at the border from Fiscal Years (FY) 2021 to 2024, many of whom were economic migrants relying on fraudulent asylum applications to gain entry, as well as spies and nationals with links to the CCP.

The facility has become a “human and civil rights catastrophe,” the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations said in the letter sent Monday to ICE and Fort Bliss officials. The organizations are calling for the camp to be shut down, alleging detained immigrants are subject to beatings and sexual abuse by officers, as well as medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of access to attorneys.

A number of detainees suffered serious injuries due to these physical abuses, the report alleges, and in one reported case a detained teenager said he lost consciousness and required hospitalization after being slammed to the ground.

“Officers have engaged in a widespread and unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force,” the organizations said in a news release.

Neither the U.S. Department of Homeland Security nor Fort Bliss immediately responded to El Paso Matters’ request for comment. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post that “no detainees are being beaten or abused” and that all people being deported to third countries are given due process protections.

The 19-page letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, ACLU said in the news release. They’re calling for a thorough investigation into all the alleged abuses.

Other organizations that signed the letter include the ACLU of New Mexico, the ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and the Texas Civil Rights Project.

“We can’t stay silent about what is happening at Camp East Montana. After speaking with dozens of detained immigrants, the reports are clear: abuse, neglect, and unsafe living conditions are widespread,” Estrella del Paso, a nonprofit organization of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, posted on Instagram, demanding “immediate action and accountability.”

Third-country removals

The groups are calling for President Donald Trump’s administration to halt all third-country removals from Fort Bliss, such as deportations to Mexico of non-Mexican immigrants, until procedural safeguards are in place.

According to the ACLU report, ICE officers reportedly handcuffed non-Mexican detainees at Camp East Montana, loaded them onto vans and transported them over an hour away to the U.S.-Mexico border near Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Masked officers then allegedly instructed detainees to “jump” into Mexico to be deported.

The alleged efforts to force people into Mexico would not comply with U.S. and international laws on third-country deportations, which require the consent of the third country and promises not to subject those being returned to persecution or abuse.

In one sworn declaration, a Cuban immigrant held at the Fort Bliss facility said officers handcuffed him and about 20 others, placed them on a bus and drove them to the border. There, they were told to get off the bus and cross into Mexico.

“If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa,” Isaac, a pseudonym used to protect his identity, said in his declaration. He told lawyers that guards hit him, slammed him against the wall about 10 times and grabbed and crushed his testicles.

Detainees who refused to cross into Mexico say they were threatened with criminal charges, long-term imprisonment or violence, the report states, citing similar claims by other Cuban immigrants.

It’s not clear from the detainees’ statements provided by the ACLU whether any migrants crossed into Mexico under the conditions described. Some of the collected affidavits state those who signed what “appeared” to be voluntary deportation papers were separated from those who refused to sign and not seen from again.

Third-country deportation refers to the U.S. sending someone to a country that is neither their home country nor a country of their citizenship.

Historically rare and based on individual cases, the practice expanded sharply under the second Trump administration as a tool to remove or intimidate immigrants who could not legally be returned to their home countries due to risks of persecution, according to the American Immigration Council.

These actions, including transfers to places where people faced imprisonment or danger, raise serious concerns about compliance with U.S. laws prohibiting deportation to countries where individuals may be persecuted or tortured, the nonprofit organization that advocates for immigration justice said.

The U.S. Supreme Court in June temporarily upheld the Trump administration’s third-country deportation policies, blocking a lower court’s order that required 15 days notice. The Supreme Court’s ruling is pending the outcome of an appeal to the lower court, expected to be heard in federal court in Massachusetts this month, the Washington Post reported. In July, ICE instructed agency personnel they could remove people to third countries with six hours notice.

The ACLU alleges detention officers threatening immigrants to cross into Mexico runs counter to the protocols governing third-country deportations — including ICE’s own guidance following the court rulings.

Medical neglect, other allegations

Other allegations in the ACLU report include:

Medical neglect: Detainees report delayed or denied medical, dental and mental health care, including failure to administer prescription medication on time or at all, despite serious chronic conditions.

Food and hygiene: Conditions are described as substandard and unsanitary. Detainees report insufficient food portions, spoiled or inedible meals, lack of adequate hygiene supplies such as soap and clean clothes, and unsanitary sleeping and living spaces.

Restricted access to legal counsel: Access to attorneys and legal resources are severely restricted or effectively denied: the facility reportedly lacks a functioning law library, detainees have limited or non-private phone access, and legal visits are often blocked or delayed.

Limited access to recreation: Detainees report extremely limited access to outdoor recreation or fresh air; many say they have gone weeks or months without seeing the sky or being allowed outside, violating standards for detainee well-being.

The detained teenager, who uses Samuel as a pseudonym for his safety, told attorneys he was beaten by officers, sustained injuries across his body and broke his front tooth after being slammed to the ground.

Samuel attested one officer ”grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” He said he felt dizzy and fought to remain conscious while an officer laughed at him for having a chipped tooth and said Samuel was “like a little girl,” the report states. Samuel lost consciousness and was transported to a hospital by ambulance.

Continued allegations of abuse at Camp East Montana

Camp East Montana opened in August in what was an active construction site and now holds more than 2,700 men and women — part of a militarized expansion of immigration detention under the Trump administration. The Washington Post in September reported the facility violated more than 60 federal detention standards within its first 50 days, citing a leaked internal ICE inspection report.

DHS called the report “false and misleading,” with McLaughlin in a statement saying any claims of inhumane conditions at ICE detention centers “categorically false.” The statement said all detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment and are provided opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family members.

The $1.2 billion facility — expected to grow to about 5,000 detainees to become the country’s largest federal detention center for civil detainees — is funded by the Department of Defense under the reconciliation bill. The Big Beautiful Bill provided $45 billion in supplemental funding to double migrant detention capacity nationwide to 100,000 beds.

In a November letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons, Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar called the conditions at Camp East Montana “dangerous and inhumane.”

“They have been since the facility opened at the beginning of August (when it was still an active construction site), and only seem to be deteriorating,” the El Paso congresswoman wrote. “It is increasingly clear that it is not a safe nor professionally managed facility.”

She said staff are unable to maintain accurate population counts, and pressed for answers about staffing, vendor changes and protocols.

Escobar said people held at Camp East Montana continue to face unsafe and unhealthy conditions, including foul-tasting drinking water, poor-quality food and inconsistent laundry services that force some detainees to wash clothes in showers. She also cited unsanitary dorms and flooding and sewage backups.

On Saturday, ICE agents in an unmarked car followed Jesus Saucedo-Portillo into a parking lot on the Minneapolis campus and attempted to detain him. Campus security and residence hall officials observed the situation and tried to intervene. Soon, more agents arrived, “pointing weapons at the crowd and pushing witnesses back” as students began recording the incident, according to a campuswide email Provost Paula O’Loughlin wrote Saturday evening: “I want to emphasize that the staff and other Augsburg community members who were present followed our protocols.”

According to the university, when a senior administrator asked to see a judicial warrant, agents said they didn’t have one and eventually arrested Saucedo-Portillo. “It was done on private property, without a warrant,” Paul Pribbenow, president of the university, told the Star Tribune. “From our perspective, that is illegal.”

A judicial warrant signed by a federal judge is required for officers to enter private property or detain someone there, according to the National Immigration Law Center. ICE arrest warrants are typically signed by immigration officials and agents must get permission to enter private areas.

However, the Department of Homeland Security has since contested the university’s claims that ICE agents didn’t have an arrest warrant. In a statement Monday, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs for DHS, accused the university administrators on the scene of attempting “to obstruct the arrest.”

“Our officers told the school Administrator and campus security that ICE had a warrant for the illegal alien’s arrest. The school Administrator told ICE officers they were violating university policies. Our officers informed them that federal law supersedes any University policy and that if campus security would not stop blocking the law enforcement vehicle from exiting, they would be obstructing justice,” McLaughlin’s statement said. “The school administrator continued her efforts to block the vehicle from leaving and ordered campus security to stand in front of the vehicle. Our officers followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to clear the area and successfully arrested this criminal illegal alien.”

McLaughlin also claimed that Saucedo-Portillo “is a registered sex offender and has a previous arrest for driving while intoxicated.” However, a search of Minnesota court records returned no record of a DWI case, and his name is not listed in the national sex offender registry, according to the Star-Tribune.

The university says its “previous statements about the incident remain unchanged,” a university spokesperson, told the newspaper Tuesday. “When asked to provide a judicial warrant, the agents refused to produce and stated they did not have one, despite being on private property.”",https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2022-12/Augs.PNG?itok=gUsxN8_k,N,,2025-12-10 18:57:38.813843

Introduction

A single mother and her daughter from Cuba arrived in Mexico seeking safety. Under Mexican law, they should have received a Tarjeta de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias (TVRH), or Visitor’s Card for Humanitarian Reasons, the official document that grants asylum seekers temporary access to work, education, and basic services while their case is pending. Months passed, and the card never came. The mother was pushed into low-paid informal work, and her daughter was denied school enrollment for lack of Mexican identification, the very identification the TVRH would have provided.

With support from USCRI’s legal team in Tijuana, the family eventually obtained their cards through a court order. Most asylum seekers, however, do not. Across Mexico, thousands are being excluded from formal jobs, education, and essential services because the National Institute of Migration (INM) has effectively stopped issuing this critical document.

Mexico’s Evolving Regional Role in International Protection

Mexico, a longstanding transit country for asylum seekers, has become a destination for migrants across the Americas in recent years. In 2014, the country received 2,137 asylum applications. That number rose to more than 130,000 in 2021 and reached a record 140,000 in 2023. That year, amid record encounters at the U.S. southern border and pressure from the U.S. Government, Mexico intensified migration enforcement and restricted access to the TVRH. In practice, the INM suspended the issuance of the TVRH for most first-time applicants.

In 2024, the INM issued 97% fewer cards than the previous year. Nearly all cards now issued are renewals rather than first-time approvals, according to Diego Ramirez, a USCRI lawyer in Tijuana. The suspension has left thousands without identification or access to formal employment, education, and essential services, violating their human rights.

Despite increased enforcement, people continue to arrive and seek asylum in Mexico. The Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) received roughly 80,000 applications in 2024 and is on track for a similar number in 2025. UNHCR’s 2025 Protection Monitoring tool found that a growing share of the people arriving in Mexico fled violence or persecution in their country and that most identified Mexico, not the United States, as their intended destination.

As the United States restricts humanitarian entry, including through pausing asylum applications and the rollback of Temporary Protected Status for some nationalities (visit USCRI’s “Get the Latest” for more), many displaced people view Mexico as a viable option, at least temporarily. Yet, without the TVRH, they are deprived of rights guaranteed to them under the 2011 Migration Law of Mexico which places them at a greater risk of exclusion and exploitation.

What is the Visitor’s Card for Humanitarian Reasons (TVRH)?

Under Mexican migration law, the INM must issue a TVRH to foreign nationals in certain situations of vulnerability, including asylum seekers. The card grants one year of lawful stay, renewable until the asylum case concludes. It allows holders to travel within the country, obtain a Temporary Unique Population Registry Code (CURP), and access health, education, and formal employment. The card also protects them from deportation.

TVRH denial constitutes a violation of human rights and Mexican law

The INM’s refusal to issue the TVRH is both unlawful under Mexican law and violates asylum seekers’ human rights, including the rights to legal identity, work, education, and healthcare. Mexican law states that asylum seekers are entitled to receive the card while their case is pending. In practice, the INM has systematically ignored this obligation, leaving thousands in legal limbo. Denying the required document undermines these rights and puts Mexico at odds with its international treaty obligations and national law.

Since 2023, the INM has blocked new cards for most first-time applicants. The agency has continued to renew cards on a limited basis for those who already have them, but new applicants face near-total denials. When questioned, INM officials point to these few renewals as evidence of compliance, even though the agency is refusing to issue cards for first-time applicants.

To avoid denying the card, some INM offices issue a substitute document known as a constancia de trámite (proof of pending process), which merely states that a person has initiated a procedure and is not valid under Mexican law. The INM has no legal authority to issue it; it bears no official signature or seal and cannot be used as identification or for employment, banking, or access to public services. According to Ramirez, the document functions as a bureaucratic loophole: “It’s how INM washes its hands. They cannot legally refuse the card, so they give this instead.”

By withholding the card, the INM denies asylum seekers access to rights guaranteed under Mexican law, including formal employment, health care, and education. Although they are lawfully present in Mexico, the absence of documentation leaves them unprotected and exposed to the same obstacles faced by those without legal status. This violates their rights and contradicts Mexico’s own legal commitments under international human rights law. The denial of such documentation also erodes trust in the Mexican asylum system.

Obstacles faced by those without TVRH and their impact on integration and protection

For asylum seekers in Mexico, the TVRH is essential. Without it, they cannot work formally, certify their children’s schooling, obtain a driver’s license, or fully participate in the economy, including using the banking system. Nearly every interaction for asylum seekers requires the card for identification.

The most serious consequence is exclusion from the formal labor market. Employers hesitate to hire asylum seekers without a TVRH, despite their legal right to work. Because opening a bank account also requires the card, employers who pay via direct deposit have no way to compensate them. As a result, many work in the informal sector where exploitation is common and wages are lower, and where they are not covered by social security.

The economic effects are tangible. Gabriela Hernandez, director of Casa Tochan in Mexico City, described a young man who had lived independently for months and worked a steady job while he waited for his card. When the card did not arrive, his employer dismissed him, and he returned to the shelter in economic distress. In Tijuana, Diego Ramirez secured a TVRH for a client whose wife was pregnant and who received a job offer with a higher salary but could not accept it without the card. These cases highlight the necessity of the card in securing formal employment and illustrate how the card determines whether asylum seekers can achieve financial stability and self-sufficiency.

The lack of the card also disrupts access to education. To enroll in school, children must present a CURP, which is granted only with a TVRH. While some schools allow enrollment, they cannot certify completion without it, discouraging many parents from registering their children. The CURP is also required for public services such as healthcare, though hospitals must provide emergency treatment regardless of immigration status.

These barriers to employment and education hinder long-term integration. Adults face exploitation in the informal sector and economic uncertainty due to low wages, while children risk falling behind in school. Without the card’s protection from deportation, asylum seekers also face fines or extortion by authorities, even when they show proof of pending asylum applications.

Overview of legal appeals and rulings

As a result of the INM’s actions, lawyers across Mexico rely on the juicio de amparo as the only available remedy. Amparo is a constitutional mechanism that protects individuals from human rights violations committed by public authorities. Lawyers file amparos before federal judges, arguing the INM’s failure to issue the card constitutes unlawful omission. Because each ruling applies only to an individual petitioner, lawyers must file cases one by one. Achieving universal, class-wide relief through the courts is unlikely, given the legal and procedural constraints.

Applicants typically present their constancia de trámite and other evidence showing they have complied with all requirements. The INM, however, often ignores judicial orders and fails to respond until judges threaten sanctions. According to Ramirez, “There is zero openness to dialogue” on the part of the INM. Even with court rulings in favor of asylum seekers, compliance is delayed until the last possible moment.

Court orders have brought individual victories, such as the case described above in which a judge intervened to force the INM to grant a man a TVRH so he could accept a formal job offer while his wife was pregnant. Yet systemic relief remains difficult. Each amparo applies to only one person, even within the same family. Organizations have also sought recourse by filing complaints before the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH). Although the CNDH has issued recommendations, the INM dismisses them by pointing to renewal statistics as evidence that they are issuing the cards.

Cases can take up to a year to resolve, and even successful rulings do not correct pervasive and consistent institutional noncompliance. Despite efforts from lawyers and civil society, no substantive change has been achieved. As advocates note, the only strategy that forces action from the INM is sustained judicial pressure.

Beyond the humanitarian sector, the problem remains largely invisible. Few media outlets cover the suspension, and public awareness is minimal. Yet, for asylum seekers and legal advocates, it represents a crisis. The repercussions for those seeking asylum are significant and hard to fully measure.

Conclusion

The suspension of the Visitor’s Cards for Humanitarian Reasons reflects a troubling contradiction in Mexico’s asylum system. While the Government recognizes asylum seekers’ legal rights, it denies them the very document that allows them to exercise those rights. The amparo process offers individual relief but cannot replace the need for INM compliance with Mexican law. Restoring TVRH issuance is essential to uphold the rule of law, protect asylum seekers’ rights, and ensure Mexico’s commitment to humanitarian and human rights principles.

Recommendations:

For the Mexican government:

Reinstatement of TVRH issuance for all asylum seekers in accordance with Article 52 of the 2011 Migration Law of Mexico.

Notification and coordination among federal and local authorities to ensure all government agencies are aware of the suspension and instructed to exercise flexibility in verifying identity or status.

For local governments:

Adoption of local-level documentation initiatives by state and municipal governments to facilitate temporary identity or service cards to enable access to rights while federal procedures remain stalled. Mexico City’s Guest and Migrant Registry (Padrón de Huéspedes y Migrantes) is a model program. While it has low enrollment, it remains in effect and permits identification and access to services for migrants regardless of their migration status.

For civil society:

Promotion of public awareness and media engagement to bring national attention to the humanitarian impacts of the suspension, ensuring accountability and sustained pressure.

For the United States Government:

Expansion of U.S. support for protection-focused programs in Mexico that improve access to documentation and legal assistance for asylum seekers.

On Human Rights Day, and every day, we reaffirm that the rights of asylum seekers in Mexico are not privileges but legal obligations that the State must uphold. By refusing to issue the TVRH to thousands of people seeking protection, the INM denies them the ability to work, study, and live with dignity.

Without the reinstatement of TVRH issuance, Mexico not only violates the human rights of thousands of asylum seekers but also perpetuates their exclusion and leaves meaningful integration and protection into Mexican society out of reach.

The president told the crowd gathered at a casino and resort in Mount Pocono that inflation was no longer a problem and that Democrats had used the term ""affordability"" as a ""hoax"" to hurt his reputation. But his remarks weaved wildly to include grievances he first raised behind closed doors in his first term in 2018 — and later denied saying — asking why the U.S. doesn't have more immigrants from Scandinavia.

""Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?"" Trump said onstage. ""Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few?""

Trump said he objected to taking immigrants from ""hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries."" He added for emphasis that those places ""are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.""

Tuesday's gathering in the swing state — and in a competitive House district — was an official White House event, yet it seemed more like one of his signature campaign rallies that his chief of staff said he would hold regularly ahead of next year's midterms. But instead of being in an arena that could draw several thousand attendees, it was held in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, a small town of about 3,000 residents.

Voters starting to blame lasting inflation on Republicans

Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

He displayed a chart comparing price increases under his predecessor, Joe Biden, to prices under his own watch to argue his case. But the overall inflation rate has climbed since he announced broad tariffs in April and left many Americans worried about their grocery, utility and housing bills.

""I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,"" Trump said. ""They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.""

As the president spoke, his party's political vulnerabilities were further seen as Miami voters chose Eileen Higgins to be their first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. Higgins defeated the Trump-endorsed Republican Emilio Gonzalez.

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally showed he could still appeal to the base, but it was unable to settle questions of whether he could hold together his 2024 coalition. Monroe County flipped to Trump last year after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.

As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.

In Monroe County, people agree that prices are a problem

But what seems undeniable — even to Trump supporters in Monroe County — is that inflation seems to be here to stay.

Lou Heddy, a retired maintenance mechanic who voted for Trump last year, said he's noticed in the past month alone that his and his wife's grocery bills have risen from $175 to $200, and he's not sure Trump can bring food prices down.

""Once the prices get up for food, they don't ever come back down. That's just the way I feel. I don't know how the hell he would do it,"" said Heddy, 72.

But Suzanne Vena, a Democratic voter, blames Trump's tariffs for making life more expensive, as she struggles with rising bills for food, rent and electricity on a fixed income. She remembers Trump saying that he would stop inflation.

""That's what we were originally told,"" said Vena, 66. ""Did I believe it? That's another question. I did not.""

The area Trump visited could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.

Trump held his rally in a congressional district held by first-term Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.

Speaking to the crowd before Trump, Bresnahan said the administration was working to lower costs, but voters ""aren't asking for partisan arguments — they're asking for results.""

It's not clear if Trump can motivate voters in Monroe County to show up in next year's election if they're worried about inflation.

Nick Riley, 38, said he's cutting back on luxuries, like going out to eat, as he absorbs higher bills for food and electricity and is having a hard time finding a good deal on a used car. Riley voted for Trump in 2020, but he sat out the 2024 election and plans to do so again next year.

""We're all broke. It doesn't matter whether you support Republicans or support Democrats,"" Riley said. ""We're all broke, and we're all feeling it.""

Trump to start holding more rallies before midterm elections

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show ""The Mom View"" that Trump would be on the campaign trail next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.

Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.

""We're actually going to turn that on its head,"" Wiles said, ""and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.""

The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying a historic boom.

Asked on a Politico podcast how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into grade inflation by answering ""A-plus,"" only to then amend his answer to ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

Trump says economy is strong, but Americans should buy fewer dolls

The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

So far, the public has been skeptical about Trump's economic performance. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

But Trump indicated that his tariffs and other policies were helping industries such as the steel sector. He said those industries mattered for the country as he then specifically told Americans that they should buy fewer pencils and dolls from overseas.

""You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,"" he told the crowd. ""Two or three is nice.""

Long Beach was recently recognized as one of the country’s top digital cities for its digital equity work and programming, something officials say is an effort that won’t lose steam in 2026 despite federal funding cuts.

The survey was from the national research and advisory institute, the Center for Digital Government, which focuses on policies and practices in state and local governments. Long Beach was among five cities nationwide to grab high marks in the Digital Cities Survey, which looks at how local governments use technology to address social challenges.

Lea Erikson, Long Beach’s director of technology, credited the recognition to the city’s approach to digital equity.

“We're not relying on federal funds to advance our work. And so even though it does definitely minimize what we can do, I'm really proud of what we have been able to do despite that,” Erikson said.

Why was Long Beach named?

Over the years, the coastal L.A. County city has grown into an epicenter for digital equity to grant more residents access to the internet.

According to the survey, the city advanced digital equity, among other things, through programs such as its “Pitch Long Beach!” — an initiative that allows the public to submit pitches on how to implement and explore technology as a way to improve city services.

Long Beach has also partnered with the California Emerging Technology Fund to launch a multilingual internet service enrollment hotline to help residents navigate telehealth, job searching and online learning.

“One of the things I think makes Long Beach a leader in this space is we have a dedicated staff to digital inclusion, and they're not dependent on federal funds, so they're actually funded by local government resources,” Erikson said.

Why are programs at risk?

In May, the Trump administration canceled the $2.75 billion Digital Equity Act, which the president called “racist” and “illegal.”

The cancellation put a stop to programs all over the country, including digital courses for seniors and laptop distributions in rural areas.

The Federal Communications Commission voted in September to end E-Rate discounts to libraries and schools for hotspot lending and school bus Wi-Fi. Officials said the initiatives “exceeded” or were “inconsistent” with the commission's authority. This decision effectively shut off funding for digital loaning programs.

Locally, the repercussions were felt instantly. Los Angeles County Library announced it would sunset its laptop and Wi-Fi hotspot lending programs shortly after the decision.

What are officials saying for 2026 and beyond?

Erikson said federal headwinds won’t stop the city’s digital equity work.

The city is working to create its own fiber-optic network by 2027 to offer free Wi-Fi in public places in an effort to save residents money and get them online.

“We're hoping to have that go out to bid … next year. We would hopefully have that done in about a two-year timeframe, so it might be a little delayed, but we have local funding for that as well,” Erikson said.

Los Angeles police officers used more than 1,000 less-lethal munitions and wounded six protesters on June 8, according to a state-mandated report released by the department.

The protests continued, along with the LAPD’s use of crowd control munitions, but the department has missed the deadline for several reports required by state law.

LAPD used less-lethal munitions for crowd control on at least four separate days in June — including the first “No Kings” protest on June 14 — and has not published reports on those incidents.

Court documents identify more than a dozen people who were struck by less-lethal munitions between June 9 and June 14. At least four were hospitalized for their injuries. The LAPD has posted video evidence of officers launching volleys of 40mm rounds and tear gas at protesters, but the only new report of crowd control weapons being used after June 8 is from an incident months later on Oct. 25.

The delay puts the LAPD in violation of Assembly Bill 48, a law that went into effect in 2022 to regulate the use of crowd control weapons like 40mm launchers, pepper balls and tear gas. All agencies that use those weapons for crowd control are required to follow up by reporting the reason the weapons were needed, how many were used and how many injuries they caused. The reports must be posted publicly to the agency’s website within 60 days in most cases, or 90 days if an extension is justified.

In a statement, the LAPD acknowledged that the department is “currently outside the 90-day public posting requirement,” saying the delay “stems from the extraordinary volume and complexity of incidents that occurred during that period.”

The department added that the forms will be posted to their website after internal review.

Hundreds of other California law enforcement agencies do not appear to follow AB 48’s reporting requirements, as LAist reported in September, reflecting what experts said was a lack of enforcement mechanism in the law.

In a statement to LAist, City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez called on the LAPD to produce the reports required by state law.

“As we face federal raids that brutalize our communities without transparency or accountability, the City of LA cannot mirror those same tactics,” the statement said. “We must act with moral clarity and protect our residents by fully complying with disclosure laws.”

Critical Incidents

The LAPD has released video evidence documenting three “critical incidents” in which people were sent to the hospital after less-lethal munitions were used against them.

State law requires law enforcement agencies to release any video recordings of incidents where either a firearm is discharged or use of force leads to serious injury or death. The LAPD posts these videos and written descriptions of the incidents on their website.

Two of the released videos show police officers shooting people in the head with 40mm rounds, though AB 48 bans aiming less-lethal rounds at the head, neck, or any other vital organs. The third shows a protester shot multiple times by less-lethal munitions before he was arrested and taken to the hospital for a fractured finger.

One video shows Marshall Woodruff, an L.A. photographer and filmmaker, get struck in both the arm and the face by less-lethal rounds as LAPD officers let loose dozens of rounds toward protesters on June 14.

In video and written descriptions of the incident, the LAPD claims the crowd began assaulting officers by throwing objects, including rocks and bottles, leading to the use of less-lethal munitions. In body camera footage made public by the department, it appears at least one object was thrown toward the officers from somewhere in the crowd.

Woodruff later told reporters he needed “four or five” hours of surgery to repair damage to his eye.

That same day, police officers shot Jack Kearns in the back of the head as he was running away. The department says in written and video descriptions of the incident that he broke through their skirmish line. Court records filed by the L.A. chapter of Black Lives Matter allege that Kearns was not noticed by police until he was nearly a block away and moving in the opposite direction.

Blood can be seen on the back of Kearns’ baseball cap in the video as he asks officers to call a medic.

Kearns told reporters in June that he suffered brain bleeding and was in the hospital for three days.

A few days earlier, on June 10, Daniel Robert Bill was shot multiple times by less-lethal munitions before he was arrested and taken to the hospital for a fractured finger.

In body camera video released by LAPD, Bill is seen standing still in front of an LAPD skirmish line when officers began to push him back with batons and opened fire with less-lethal launchers.

The police department has been accused of using less-lethal munitions against members of the media after June 8, including the use of a 40mm round that struck Australian reporter Lauren Tomasi on June 9.

A lawsuit by the L.A. Press Corps and news outlet Status Coup has identified 12 members of the media, including Tomasi, who are alleged to have been struck by less-lethal rounds from June 9 through June 14.

None of those incidents have been reported as required by AB 48.

Concerns about potential misuse

The L.A. City Council voted last week to continue allowing the LAPD to use 40mm less-lethal launchers and tear gas.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell argued in council chambers that such weapons are a ""de-escalation tool” that reduces the need of the department to use deadly force.

Some civil rights attorneys and other experts have told LAist they believe the LAPD’s use of less-lethal munitions against protesters has gone too far.

Adrienna Wong, a senior staff attorney with ACLU SoCal, told LAist in June that the indiscriminate use of force against protesters that month violated the law and the First Amendment rights of demonstrators.

“We have seen evidence that kinetic projectiles and chemical agents have been used indiscriminately, have injured people that have been protesting peacefully, are journalists or are in a crowd of people, and that seems to violate the express purpose of these laws,” Wong said.

Jeff Wenninger is a former LAPD lieutenant who led a unit that investigated all officer-involved shootings and use-of-force cases from 2013 until his retirement in 2024. He told LAist he thinks the LAPD has been too quick to use less-lethal munitions.

He pointed out that one of the two circumstances where less-lethal force is allowed is in response to a risk of serious bodily injury or death, which is the same as the requirement for lethal force.

The other allowed circumstance, according to AB 48, is to “bring an objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely and effectively under control.”

Wenninger said the law requires officers to have specific targets when using these weapons, rather than indiscriminately deploying them to disperse crowds.

“ A lot of the articulation and the justification for [less-lethal force] being used tends to suggest to me that law enforcement agencies don't actually really understand the law,” Wenninger told LAist.

Long-term pain

While they are called “less-lethal,” crowd control munitions can cause serious injury or death.

Martin Santoyo has filed a lawsuit against the LAPD for allegedly shooting him in the groin with a 40mm launcher from just feet away.

Santoyo has said in court documents that he was “lawfully exercising his First Amendment right to protest and posed no risk of harm to anyone.” Then, Santoyo claims, an officer intentionally shot him suddenly and without warning “from within several feet.”

He required emergency surgery on his testicles after he was shot, according to court documents, and he said he has endured months of “tremendous physical pain.”

Will Horowitz, a lawyer for Santoyo, told LAist his client needed a month of recovery before he was able to return to work.

The city of L.A. can also expect to feel some fiscal pain when lawsuits alleging misuse of these less-lethal munitions make their way through courtrooms and settlement negotiations.

Santoyo’s civil lawsuit includes accusations of negligence, assault, battery and violations of his constitutional rights. As cases like his mount, so will the potential liability payments that have already been rapidly increasing in recent years.

Employees at the U.S. Education Department who were fired in March got an unexpected email on Friday – telling them to return to work.

These federal workers, including many attorneys, investigate family complaints of discrimination in the nation's schools as part of the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). They were terminated by the Trump administration in a March reduction-in-force, but the courts intervened, temporarily blocking the department from completing their terminations.

That left 299 OCR employees, roughly half of its staff, in legal and professional limbo – because the department elected to place them on paid administrative leave while the legal battle plays out rather than allow them to work. Court records show 52 have since chosen to leave.

On Friday, an unknown number of the remaining 247 staffers received an email from the department. That email, which was shared with NPR by two people who received it, says that, while the Trump administration will continue its legal battle to downsize the department, ""utilizing all OCR employees, including those currently on administrative leave, will bolster and refocus efforts on enforcement activities in a way that serves and benefits parents, students, and families.""

Staff were instructed to report to their regional office on Monday, Dec. 15.

In a statement to NPR, Julie Hartman, the department's press secretary for legal affairs, confirmed that the department ""will temporarily bring back OCR staff.""

""The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force,"" Hartman wrote, ""but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers.""

The department did not clarify how many staffers it was recalling or why it was recalling them now, after keeping them on paid administrative leave for much of the year.

""By blocking OCR staff from doing their jobs, Department leadership allowed a massive backlog of civil rights complaints to grow, and now expects these same employees to clean up a crisis entirely of the Department's own making,"" said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, a union that represents many Education Department employees. ""Students, families, and schools have paid the price for this chaos.""

The department did not respond to a request to share the current size of OCR's complaint backlog, but one department source who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Trump administration, told NPR that OCR now has about 25,000 pending complaints, including roughly 7,000 open investigations.

Gittleman said the administration's decision to keep these OCR attorneys on paid leave ""has already wasted more than $40 million in taxpayer funds— rather than letting them do their jobs.""

NPR could not independently verify that cost.

In October, the administration attempted to fire another 137 OCR staffers, though they were reinstated as part of a deal to end the government shutdown.

In all, just 62 employees at OCR have not received a termination notice at some point this year — about 10% of the office's January headcount.

Two days before the department notified staff they were being recalled, NPR reported on the impact these OCR cuts have had on students with disabilities and their families.

Maggie Heilman told NPR that she filed a complaint with OCR in 2024, alleging that her daughter, who has Down syndrome, was denied her right to a free, appropriate public education at school. OCR began investigating in October 2024, but it was disrupted repeatedly by the aforementioned staff cuts. Heilman's case remains one of the roughly 7,000 open investigations.

Of the administration's decision to try to cut many attorneys who protect students' civil rights, Heilman said, ""it's telling families with children like [my daughter] that their hurt doesn't matter.""

Since Trump took office, public data shows that OCR has reached resolution agreements in 73 cases involving alleged disability discrimination. Compare that to 2024, when OCR resolved 390, or 2017, the year Trump took office during his first term, when OCR reached agreements in more than 1,000 such cases.

ICE in Cedar-Riverside

What we know:

Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman, who represents Ward 6, described the scene in a statement released Tuesday night. In the statement, Osman shared an account from a constituent who witnessed the ICE operation Tuesday afternoon in Cedar-Riverside and went to check on his neighbors. The resident, a legal U.S. citizen, said he was stopped and ""harassed"" by ICE agents despite his legal status.

The backstory:

In the statement, Osman recounts:

""Mobashir, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen who has lived in Minneapolis since he was 1-year-old, was working at a restaurant on the top floor of a building in Cedar-Riverside when he observed ICE agents harassing individuals in the parking lot below. Concerned for his neighbors, he descended the back stairs to assess the situation. Upon stepping outside, two agents immediately rushed him, tackled him to the ground, and applied a chokehold, leaving him confused and terrified.""

Despite attempts to verify his legal status, Mobashir was taken to a detention center in Bloomington. When he was finally released, Osman says Mobashir wasn't offered any transportation back to Cedar-Riverside and was told to ""walk"" back in the winter storm.

What they're saying:

""I felt targeted,"" Mobashir told reporters during a news conference on Wednesday. ""Any Somali he sees, I guess he just wants to tackle them and push them to the ground.""

""This was a person who was out on the street doing literally nothing wrong,"" added Mayor Frey. ""And what we saw by these ICE agents, who clearly did not know what they were doing, was violence and unwillingness to hear the simple truth, which he was repeating again and again, which is 'I'm an American citizen.' Those were the words that he was saying again and again. Those words, if nothing else, should give them a minute of pause so that they could find out, 'Hey, who are you? What's your name? Are you a citizen or not? Have you done literally anything wrong at all other than existing in the world?'""

Group pepper sprayed in Cedar-Riverside

Local perspective:

The Associated Press also detailed the confrontation in Cedar-Riverside, including a group of protesters who were pepper sprayed by ICE agents.

According to the report, the group was blocking the agents' vehicles as they checked identifications in the neighborhood. According to Osman, the agents only found U.S. citizens, no undocumented immigrants. According to the report, the agents were ultimately confronted by a group of ""mostly white young people"" who blew whistles to alert people in the area.

It appears the only person taken into custody during the afternoon operation was Mobashir.

Big picture view:

The Trump administration has sent as many as 100 ICE agents to the Twin Cities over the past week as part of a special immigration operation targeting Somali immigrants. President Trump has cited fraud cases, like Feeding our Future, which have involved members of the Somali community, as his basis for the targeted initiative.

Speaking on Tuesday, President Trump once again revived his attacks on the Somali community and Minnesota's leadership.

""If you don't share our values, contribute to our economy, and assimilate into our society, then we don't want you in our country, we don't want you,"" the president said during a speech in Pennsylvania. ""Ilhan Omar and the people from Somalia, they hate our country, and they think we're stupid people, which actually, when they allow that to happen, they are. That's headed by, Governor Walz, one of the dumber people around. But think of it, he's given not like peanuts, billions. These are people that don't work at their own country. Their own country is a failure. They have no money, and yet they come into our country and steal tens of billions of dollars. How stupid are we to allow that to happen?""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1280/720/image2025-12-10-11h26m52s321.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-10 16:57:19.880845

Rojas’ traumatic experience is typical of ICE activity in the region, said Genevra Alberti, an immigration attorney in Kansas City, Missouri.
He arrived in the Kansas City area in April 2016 and said he struggled to find adequate legal representation.
They wanted to know why federal agents were chasing somebody through their jurisdiction.
And with the very, very different way that I was easily employed in Kansas City, it is very harsh here,” Rojas said.","TOPEKA — A roving patrol of federal agents chased Julio Rojas through the Olathe streets in August and, after capturing him, put a knee on his neck while they wrapped him in chains.

Like most of the people detained as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation blitz, Rojas had no criminal record. The federal agents had no warrant for his arrest.

As the 25-year-old bounced from Kansas City to Oklahoma to Louisiana during 23 days in custody, Rojas never had the chance to talk to an attorney and never appeared before a judge. He was placed on a plane at 2 a.m. one morning and flown to El Salvador, where he remains.

“What has impacted me the most is being separated from my child, and to lose everything I had built in 10 years,” he said through an interpreter during a video call with reporters last month.

Rojas was in custody when his son turned 7. The boy remains here with his mother, who has permanent residency.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has dramatically escalated efforts to round up immigrants at President Donald Trump’s behest, often with disregard for their civil rights. The Trump administration’s fast-track deportation policies have been challenged at least 362 times in federal district courts, The Conversation reported. It has lost 350 of those cases before 160 different judges. The administration continues to defend the lack of due process in deportation proceedings.

Rojas’ traumatic experience is typical of ICE activity in the region, said Genevra Alberti, an immigration attorney in Kansas City, Missouri.

She described roving patrols in unmarked vehicles, with agents who won’t identify themselves or show ID, and who don’t explain why they are taking someone into custody.

Some agents, she said, “clearly get enjoyment out of arresting, detaining noncitizens, even those who have no criminal history and have families, and those people are just having a ball.”

“In a different time, the subjects of those arrests would have thought they were being kidnapped for real, by actual criminals, because of the way this has been done,” Alberti said. “However, because they know that this is going on now, they just assume it’s ICE, but they don’t know that for sure.”

‘Another rat to the count’

Rojas grew up in El Salvador and said he came to the United States at age 16 as an asylum seeker, trying to get away from gangs.

He arrived in the Kansas City area in April 2016 and said he struggled to find adequate legal representation. He missed a key hearing, and a deportation order was issued. But as he determined to work through a bewildering appeals process, he made a home in Olathe, started a family, and went to work for Verizon and AT&T, installing internet, he said.

His life was upended one morning in early August when four trucks approached him in his vehicle at an auto parts store. He said they pursued him for about 10 minutes before they stopped him.

He recalled an agent with a gun in his hand.

“He was repeating, ‘Get the f*** on the ground.’ Like, all the time, just yelling at me,” Rojas said. “So all that I did was that I kneeled. I put my hands up. And in no moment I was resisting. He came by, and he hit me in the back. And then he put his knee on my neck.”

The agents put chains on his waist, feet and hands, he said.

“That’s when this officer started saying, ‘There’s another rat to the count,’ ” Rojas said.

He was one of 32,364 people booked by ICE in August 2025, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data collection center at Syracuse University. The data shows more than 70% of ICE detainees have no criminal record.

Court records show Rojas’ only interaction with the law was a traffic ticket in 2018 for driving without a license. He paid the $100 fine.

“At the beginning, the administration began to say the only people who would be deported are the people who have crimes in the United States,” Rojas said. “But in this moment, how immigrants’ rights are being violated, all of those people who have a deportation order, it doesn’t matter what the reason is.”

After he was taken into custody, Rojas said he overheard a call from Olathe police. They wanted to know why federal agents were chasing somebody through their jurisdiction.

The federal agent’s response, according to Rojas: “Tell that bitch to not mind our business.”

Olathe police Sgt. John Moncayo said “we don’t know anything about what occurred” with Rojas.

“It appears that Mr. Rojas’ story is embellished quite a bit, as we do not have any information to support his claims,” Moncayo said.

Moncayo didn’t answer a Kansas Reflector question about the police department’s relationship with ICE.

‘Making this normal’

Alberti, the immigration attorney, said she has clients who were pulled over by federal agents for “literally no reason other than how they looked.”

Then, she said, they are arrested and detained. Some are no longer here. Some are still in custody. None has a criminal history.

She described ICE enforcement in the Kanas City area as “being on steroids.”

“I have never seen or heard of this many sort of roving patrols happening here in this area before,” she said. “And what I mean by that is just ICE themselves pulling people over while they’re driving for no reason. ICE has no authority to pull people over for traffic infractions or anything like that, so they are literally just pulling them over because they look foreign. So basically, a lot of these people are just being pulled over for driving while brown.”

She said it is easy to run when you don’t know who is chasing you. Rojas described his arrest as the moment he was most afraid in his life.

ICE officers aren’t allowed to arrest someone without a warrant, Alberti said, unless they have probable cause to believe the person is a flight risk. But if someone has a removal order, as Rojas did, no warrant is needed.

“One of the scary things is ICE is making it normal to not identify yourself,” Alberti said. “I mean, on top of everything else, they’re wearing masks. Their faces are covered. They look like paramilitaries or bank robbers, for God’s sakes, and they’re making this normal.”

She urged people to pay attention to what is happening with immigration enforcement. Even people “whose hearts are in the right places” are overwhelmed by bad news and have stopped listening, she said.

“I get that it’s necessary for mental health purposes, maybe, to take a break once in a while from listening to the news and just hearing nothing but bad things all the time,” Alberti said. “But right now is not the time to do that. Take a day off and then go back and listen to what’s going on, because apathy is going to ruin this country.”

‘Very harsh here’

Rojas said he wore the same clothes for eight days straight at the ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana. At times he went without a toothbrush or blanket. He had one minute one time to make a phone call.

“At no moment did they ever present me with an arrest warrant, did they ever let me see a judge. They never told me anything,” he said.

One night at 8 p.m., officials took him from his cell, held him somewhere else for a few hours, handcuffed and shackled him with chains, then put him on a plane bound for San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. There, local authorities held him for eight hours to investigate whether he had any outstanding arrest warrants. Then they took him to a place called “the house of the immigrant,” where he was given clothes and shampoo.

He misses his son, and hopes to return to the United States someday, “in the most legal way possible.”

“In this moment, I have been two months without a job. And with the very, very different way that I was easily employed in Kansas City, it is very harsh here,” Rojas said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-11-05-143644-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 15:57:10.179948

Some principals reported that they were “unsure what had happened to a few of their students from immigrant families”, the report said.
Principals said students were impacted by ICE enforcement efforts in their communities, but also by a growing anti-immigrant atmosphere among the student population.
A Michigan principal recounted students saying: “Your parents are border hoppers,” adding that she had taken disciplinary action against bullying.
“High school principals are charged both by professional standards and moral obligation to ensure that students feel safe, and it’s clear students feeling safe at school is essential for their learning,” Rogers said.","Immigrant students across the US have experienced increased bullying, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns causing declines in attendance and a “culture of fear” among immigrant students in public schools, according to a new survey of high school principals.

Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access (Idea) conducted a “nationally representative” survey of more than 600 principals about the toll of raids and deportations, and how schools were responding.

Many principals described a “climate of distress”, the report found, with 70.4% reporting that students from immigrant families have “expressed concerns about their well-being or the well-being of their families”. A majority of public high schools experienced declines in attendance and learning of students from immigrant families, the report said, with 57.8% of principals reporting that immigrant parents and guardians had “left the community” during the school year.

Some principals reported that they were “unsure what had happened to a few of their students from immigrant families”, the report said. And 63.8% of principals said students had missed school “due to policies or political rhetoric related to immigrants”.

Principals said students were impacted by ICE enforcement efforts in their communities, but also by a growing anti-immigrant atmosphere among the student population. More than one-third of the principals said students from immigrant families had reported being “bullied or harassed”, with one Minnesota principal saying: “There has been definitely an uptick in comments made by white students, white male students, to our Hispanic students: ‘Can I see your papers?’”

A Nebraska principal described an increase in students’ “use of hostile and derogatory language” toward Latino students, with taunts like: “Go back home”. A Michigan principal recounted students saying: “Your parents are border hoppers,” adding that she had taken disciplinary action against bullying.

The survey, conducted over the summer, also found the vast majority of schools were taking actions to address the needs of their immigrant populations “as best as they can”, with 77.6% of principals saying they “created a school plan to respond to visits from federal agents”. Nearly half of the principals said they had plans to address the needs of students if their guardians are deported.

“Principals are telling stories of students being dropped off at school and worrying that will be the last time they see their parents. It’s devastating,” John Rogers, Idea director and lead researcher, said in an interview. He said he was struck by the fact that so many school leaders were preparing for that outcome: “It speaks to a normalization of a system that is being put in place that creates extraordinary trauma.”

One principal compared the stress of worrying about ICE showing up to the anxiety of fearing mass shooters.

Rogers said he expected to see these concerns in a city like Los Angeles, which has a large immigrant population and has been an aggressive target of the federal government. But the survey found consequences in schools across the nation in a diverse range of communities, he said.

“High school principals are charged both by professional standards and moral obligation to ensure that students feel safe, and it’s clear students feeling safe at school is essential for their learning,” Rogers said. “At the same time, they realize their power is limited … they can’t control what is going on outside of school.”

A Massachusetts principal surveyed said: “There is something just so fundamentally wrong about this – we continue to strive to make school a safe place where all students can thrive, but this task has become increasingly challenging.”

As four students seeking asylum in the U.S. remained in federal immigration custody Tuesday night, dozens of community members asked Detroit school officials to do more to protect newcomers.

All four of the students went to Western International High School in Southwest Detroit.

Before public comment began at the Detroit Public Schools Community District board meeting, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district and the board would release a statement calling for the students’ release.

“These continue to be troubling times for the district and our immigrant population,” Vitti said. “We do advocate for our federal government to find better uses of its time and resources to attack the real problems in our society and not immigrant populations.”

Vitti said the district will continue to work with advocacy groups to support the students and will distribute information to students about their rights.

He said immigration officials have not attempted to enter district property.

Many at the meeting said the letter wasn’t enough. They want the district to take a harder stance against immigration enforcement. Among their demands were mandatory staff training, safer transportation, and counseling for students with immigration concerns.

“It’s time to stop being scared,” Heidi West, a teacher at Academy of the Americas, said to the board. “Speak up strongly and publicly.”

There have been at least five DPSCD students detained by ICE in the months since federal immigration enforcement ramped up in the second Trump administration.

‘Shattered dreams’ for students detained by ICE

All four students had pending court dates in asylum cases, said Christine Sauvé, manager of policy and communication at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.

Mor Ba, a 19-year-old who came to the U.S. without any family from Senegal in April, graduated from Western International last month.

The night before his detention, Ba filled out college applications, Adja Ndoye of the Detroit-based African Bureau for Immigrants and Social Affairs said. Ba planned to study mechanical engineering.

“He was already going around and asking about apprenticeships,” said Ndoye. “He had his goals set on how to make a new life. I think he was thriving. He was the embodiment of the American dream.”

On Nov. 26, police stopped Ba and blocked his vehicle in search of another person, Ndoye said. The teen, who was on his way to work, provided the officers his identification to confirm he was not the person they were looking for, but was still taken into custody, she said.

Ba is being held at the Northlake Correctional Facility in Baldwin about three and half hours north of Detroit, ICE records show. He had a pending asylum case with a court date scheduled for early next year, Ndoye said.

On Sunday, Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez, a 17-year-old in 11th grade from Venezuela, was taken into ICE custody, according to Kristen Schoettle, one of his Western International teachers.

The teen and his mother were reportedly pulled over by police in Fraser for driving under the speed limit, Sauvé said.

Zamora Perez is a star baseball player with good grades and aspirations of playing in college, according to his teachers.

Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and Antony Janier Peña Sosa, 16-year-old cousins who came to the U.S. in 2023 from Venezuela were taken into immigration custody on Nov. 20. with two of their parents. Federal agents raided their home on the eastside of Detroit while the family slept, attorney George Washington said at a recent protest outside of Western International. The agents were searching for another person.

Sosa Rivero, an 11th grader, plays volleyball, shared alternative indie rock music with her teacher, and looked forward to attending college.

Peña Sosa, in 10th grade, plays the violin, excelled in Advanced Placement art class, and was quickly learning English, according to his teachers.

The three students under 18 were sent to facilities in Texas, Sauvé said.

Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an 18-year-old who attended Western International, was detained by ICE in May. He was deported to Colombia, where he was born, in June.

Boyoga-Duarte, who arrived in the U.S. at 16, was only 3.5 credits away from graduating. He was working to get the travel documents he needed to return to Colombia before his arrest.

Teachers want for more resources, training

Educators and advocates have been vocal in recent months demanding the district offer know-your-rights training, more counseling, and safer transportation options for students with immigration concerns.

Last month, dozens of people asked the board to update its 2019 “Sanctuary District” policy and train all of its staff in protocols around interacting with ICE. The board did not take any action.

Alexander Cintron, director of the newcomer program at Western International, told Chalkbeat that attendance is being impacted by fears of ICE. “It’s also affecting students’ grades and mental health,” he said.

There is “an undercurrent of despair and anxiety” in students who are immigrants, a teacher of one of the detained students said. The teacher asked for anonymity out of concern about retribution from the district.

“How do you teach someone who had family members yanked from them?” the educator said. “How can I address their constant worries about being stopped at a park by immigration while trying to meet their educational needs?”

Schoettle said she lost around 20 students this year due to immigration issues.

“I had about eight more tell me they wanted to leave today,” she said during Tuesday’s meeting.

Sauvé said schools can play a pivotal role in sharing information. The nonprofit released best practices for schools in February.

“We get so many calls from teachers who say they’re not hearing information from their leadership,” she said.

Seydi Sarr, founder of ABISA, asked district officials to meet with parents of English learners and use their resources to help them advocate to state lawmakers.

“We want you to wield the power that you have to make sure we have a real impact,” she said.

Other speakers asked for the board to meet with English language teachers, a legal support hotline, make it clear educators can give out “Know Your Rights” cards to students, more public condemnation of immigration enforcement from board members, and for the district to support students’ right to protest.

Board members did not address the speakers when public comment ended.

Once the meeting adjourned, some attendees yelled at the board for not responding to their concerns.

“What if it was your kids?” one said.

Corletta Vaughn, chair of the board, said after the meeting that the letter in support of the students would be posted publicly by the end of the week.

There were more than 7,400 English learners in the Detroit district last school year, making up more than 15% of all students.

Around 1,200 students were newcomers in DPSCD last year, meaning they have been in the U.S. for less than three years and are not fluent English speakers.

“Failing to adequately report on human rights violations further damages the credibility of the U.S. on human rights issues.","In August 2025, the U.S. Department of State released its 2024 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, a long-standing, congressionally mandated tool for documenting abuses worldwide. These reports have significant consequences for foreign-policy decisions, funding allocations, asylum adjudications, and immigration enforcement. Worryingly, critics now claim the reports have been reshaped to reflect political priorities rather than objective human-rights analysis.

As Amanda Klasing, National Director of Government Relations and Advocacy at Amnesty International USA, puts it:

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries … In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries—for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people—there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country.”

This sharp critique raises immediate concerns for immigration lawyers and practitioners. Why? Because these reports don’t sit in isolation. They feed into myriad immigration processes—from asylum claims to country-condition evidence, to eligibility for humanitarian-based visas and protections.

Why State Department Human-Rights Reports Matter for Immigration

These reports serve several critical roles:

Country-condition evidence: Asylum applicants often rely on this U.S. government publication to demonstrate systematic human-rights violations in their country of origin.

Diplomatic and enforcement context: U.S. foreign-policy decisions—including refugee admissions, Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Reports, and foreign assistance oversight—hinge in part on these assessments.

Legislative oversight tool: Congress uses the reports to ensure U.S. funding does not benefit regimes known for torture or suppression of fundamental freedoms (see historical mandate under the Foreign Assistance Act).

When these reports become truncated or politicized, the downstream impact is real: weaker evidentiary bases in immigration cases, reduced accountability for perpetrators, and eroded trust in U.S. human-rights leadership. As Klasing noted:

“This sends a chilling message that the U.S. is willing to overlook some abuses, signaling that people experiencing human rights violations may be left to fend for themselves.”

The 2024 Report Changed Dramatically from Previous Years

Key changes flagged by advocates include:

Reduced length and coverage: Some country sections were substantially shortened, with entire categories removed (such as LGBTQ+ rights, gender-based violence, or minority persecution).

Differential treatment of ally vs. adversary countries: Reports on favored nations seemingly softened or omitted significant violations. For example, the section on Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza was limited to just nine pages, without mention of the ongoing International Court of Justice genocide case or starvation claims.

Rewriting of internal instructions: Leaked draft chapters and internal guidance indicate that new instructions from Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed report drafters to “cut everything not legislatively mandated” and to streamline the 2024 Country Reports to the “underlying legislative mandate” and Trump-era executive orders. Former State Department officials say they were told to edit the reports down to the “bare minimum of what was statutorily required,” and human rights groups warn that career human-rights experts inside the State Department have been purged or overridden by political appointees. From an immigration-law perspective, the consequences are troubling: if country-condition evidence becomes less complete, the factual basis of asylum, withholding, CAT, and humanitarian-based applications may be undermined.

What Are the Implications for Immigration Practitioners?

Here are some considerations and tactics for practitioners in light of these developments:

First, I’d recommend you double-check country-condition sources. Don’t rely solely on the State Department report. Given the credible allegations of omissions or downplaying, supplement with reports from non-governmental organizations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and similar. Additionally, you can check United Nations Special Procedures reports and even look into local civil society testimonies or affidavits.

Second, you can raise the issue of weakened reporting as a claim factor. Where country-condition evidence appears incomplete, especially for allied nations or less politically convenient cases, you may argue the insufficiency of the formal report or highlight that omissions themselves reflect risk of harm.

Third, you can document omission risk in asylum and humanitarian cases, for instance, if you are representing a client from a country where the report appears to have been trimmed or shielded, it may bolster the argument of risk by pointing to independent evidence of human-rights violations not reflected in the report. It may also provide grounds to challenge agency reliance on a truncated report as the sole basis for denial.

Reduced human-rights reporting signals broader trends: weakening of monitoring institutions, de-prioritization of certain rights categories (LGBTQ+, gender, minority), and shifting U.S. global posture. These trends may affect future asylum claims, resettlement priorities, and visa-processing policy (e.g., humanitarian-based visas, special-immigrant statuses). This is something you should monitor, and your fellow AILA members will be doing the same.

I realize that these significant changes mean that yet again immigration attorneys are going to have to shift how they advise clients. It can be hard to explain how something as esoteric as State Department reports can have a real impact on their case. But they can, and I really believe they will. So, in my own practice, I’m working to advise clients accordingly. For asylum or withholding/deferral of removal, I talk to them about having to prepare alternative sources and document the gaps in the State Department report. For prospective clients from countries with apparent omissions, I’ll be advising on the timing of filings and the possibility of using supplemental evidence. And I’ll be tracking the timing of reports, delays in release, and patterns of omissions—these may themselves be useful advocacy tools.

What Needs to Change

To restore trust in these important reports and protect their utility for immigration practitioners, several reforms are vital:

Re-establish independence and transparency of the bureau drafting the reports, ensuring career experts, not political appointees, determine content.

Reinstate full coverage of rights categories (gender, LGBTQ+, minority, civil society).

Require public explanation of changes in structure or omissions, so that civil-society users, including immigration advocates—can assess reliability.

Encourage congressional oversight of how reports influence immigration and foreign-assistance decisions.

Until these reforms are implemented, immigration practitioners must remain vigilant: rely on multiple sources, document the gaps, and incorporate the weakness of official reporting into client strategy.

Immigrant child care workers and preschool teachers, the majority of whom are working and living in the U.S. legally, say they are wracked by anxiety over possible encounters with ICE officials. Some have left the field, and others have been forced out by changes to immigration policy.

At CentroNía, CEO Myrna Peralta said all staff must have legal status and work authorization. But ICE’s presence and the fear it generates have changed how the school operates.

“That really dominates all of our decision making,” Peralta said.

Instead of taking children on walks through the neighborhood, staff members push children on strollers around the hallways. And staff converted a classroom into a miniature library when the school scrapped a partnership with a local library.

The child care industry depends on immigrants

Schools and child care centers were once off limits to ICE officials, in part to keep children out of harm’s way. But those rules were scrapped not long after Trump’s inauguration. Instead, ICE officials are urged to exercise “common sense.”

Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended ICE officials’ decision to enter the Chicago preschool. She said the teacher, who had a work permit and was later released, was a passenger in a car that was being pursued by ICE officials. She got out of the car and ran into the preschool, McLaughlin said, emphasizing the teacher was “arrested in the vestibule, not in the school.” The man who had been driving went inside the preschool, where officials arrested him.

About one-fifth of America’s child care workers were born outside the United States and one-fifth are Latino. The proportion of immigrants in some places, particularly large cities, is much higher: In the District of Columbia, California and New York, around 40% of the child care workforce is foreign-born, according to UC Berkeley’s Center for the Study of Child Care Employment.

Immigrants in the field tend to be better educated than those born in the United States. Those from Latin America help satisfy the growing demand for Spanish-language preschools, such as CentroNía, where some parents enroll their kids to give them a head start learning another language.

The American Immigration Council estimated in 2021 that more than three-quarters of immigrants working in early care and education were living and working in the U.S. legally. Preschools like CentroNía conduct rigorous background checks, including verifying employees have work authorization.

Beyond the deportation efforts, the Trump administration in recent months has stripped legal status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Many of them had fled violence, poverty or natural disasters in their homes and received Temporary Protected Status, which allowed them to live and work legally in the U.S. But Trump ended those programs, forcing many out of their jobs — and the country. Just last month, 300,000 immigrants from Venezuela lost their protected status.

CentroNía lost two employees when they lost their TPS, Peralta said, and a Nicaraguan immigrant working as a teacher left on his own. Tierra Encantada, which runs Spanish immersion preschools in several states, had a dozen teachers leave when they lost their TPS.

Fear is affecting even those in the US legally

At CentroNía, one staff member was detained by ICE while walking down the street and held for several hours, all the while unable to contact colleagues to let them know where she was. She was released that evening, said the school’s site director, Joangelee Hernández-Figueroa.

Another staff member, teacher Edelmira Kitchen, said she was pulled over by ICE on her way to work in September. Officials demanded she get out of her car so they could question her. Kitchen, a U.S. citizen who immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child, said she refused and they eventually let her go.

“I felt violated of my rights,” Kitchen said.

Hernández-Figueroa said ICE’s heightened presence during the federal intervention in the city has taken a toll on employees’ mental health. Some have gone to the hospital with panic attacks in the middle of the school day.

When the city sent mental health consultants to the school earlier this year as part of a partnership with the Department of Behavioral Health, school leadership had them work with teachers rather than students, worried their anguish would spill over to the classroom.

“If the teachers aren’t good,” Hernández-Figueroa said, “the kids won’t be good either.”

It’s not just adults who are feeling more anxious. At a Guidepost Montessori School in Portland, Oregon, teachers observed preschoolers change in the weeks after an ICE arrest near the school in July. After pulling over a father who was driving his child to the school, officials encountered him in the school parking lot and tried to arrest him. In the ensuing commotion, the school went into lockdown: Children were pulled off the playground, and teachers played loud music and had children sing along to drown out the yelling.

Amy Lomanto, who heads the school, said teachers noticed more outbursts among students, and more students retreating to what the school calls “the regulation station,” an area in the main office with fidget toys kids can use to calm themselves.

“We will organize more, put our hands and efforts together and fight back” Jama said, who thanked the protesters who showed up when federal officers arrived in Cedar-Riverside Tuesday.","A Minneapolis man said federal immigration officers chased him on foot in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood Tuesday, tackled him and handcuffed and arrested him even though he’s a U.S. citizen.

He shared his story Tuesday, identifying himself as Mubashir, but declining to share his last name. Mubashir spoke at a news conference organized by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN) after video of his arrest was widely viewed on social media.

“I just felt targeted,” Mubashir said. “That shouldn’t happen to anyone, that’s not right.”

In the video, a federal officer is seen putting Mubashir in a choke hold and forcing him onto his knees in the snow as he was on his way to get food. Mubashir said he told officers multiple times that he is a U.S. citizen and asked if he could show them his I.D. Officers ignored him, dragged him in the snow and pushed him into a car as witnesses yelled and blew whistles, according to the video of his arrest.

The video also showed witnesses chasing after the car in traffic; one person stood in front of the vehicle at one point.

The arrest occurred as federal agents walked into nearby businesses in the Somali-heavy neighborhood, questioning people and asking them to show their passports.

Mubashir said he was in the car with officers for about 20 minutes, asking them repeatedly if he could show them his I.D. They refused, he said.

Officers asked if they could take a picture of him to check if he was a U.S. citizen. Mubashir told reporters that he declined their request, because, “How would a picture prove I’m a U.S. citizen?”

Officers took him to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling, which houses immigration court and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices. They took his fingerprints and then one of the officers allowed Mubashir to show his I.D., proving his U.S. citizenship, Mubashir said. He was then immediately allowed to leave.

Mubashir said he asked if the officers could take him home to Cedar-Riverside, but they refused. They told him to walk home, he said, so his parents picked him up.

“I deserve to be here like anyone else — I’m a U.S. citizen,” he said. “I can’t even step outside without being tackled — no question — because I’m Somali.”

Mubashir has lived in Minneapolis since he was a year old, according to a newsletter published by Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman.

“This young man is a bright, hardworking member of our community, and his experience is a stark reminder of the overreach and lack of accountability in ICE operations,” read Osman’s newsletter.

At least two other local Somali residents were arrested by federal immigration officers Tuesday and then released, because they are also U.S. citizens, said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN.

CAIR-MN has received many calls from Somali residents who are U.S. citizens reporting that they were arrested or questioned by federal agents since “Operation Metro Surge” started last week targeting their community, Hussein said. There are varying reports of how long officers kept residents in detention before they were released, he added.

“We believe this is a violation of our constitution,” Jaylani said, adding that his organization is potentially considering legal action to address “this particular abuse of power.”

Another similar incident involving the arrest of a U.S. citizen of Somali descent occurred last Wednesday, according to a Fox 9 news article. A Somali woman was detained while she was running errands in downtown Minneapolis and held in ICE custody for 24 hours. Her cousin told Fox 9 that federal agents mocked her hijab and “touched her inappropriately.”

Fox 9 also reported that two Somali U.S. citizens were questioned by federal officers last Tuesday.

Jaylani urged Somali Minnesotans to call CAIR-MN at 612-206-3360 if ICE agents question or arrest them. CAIR-MN has organized a task force to respond to ICE arrests.

Hassan Jama, an imam at the Al-Hikam Islamic Center in Minneapolis, is a task force member. He said he’s seen an increase in racist rhetoric targeting Somalis, including at restaurants and schools.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling.
The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order was constitutional.
A federal judge in July blocked the citizenship order in a class action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.
The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order.","The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to take up the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s order on birthright citizenship declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices will hear Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the country.

The case will be argued in the spring. A definitive ruling is expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, is part of his Republican administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings. But the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. His order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

The Supreme Court, however, did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order was constitutional.

Every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship. Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under longstanding rules.

The case under review comes from New Hampshire. A federal judge in July blocked the citizenship order in a class action lawsuit including all children who would be affected. The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, the ACLU’s national legal director, said in a statement, adding, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

The administration had also asked the justices to review a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. That court, also in July, ruled that a group of Democratic-led states that sued over Trump’s order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others. The justices took no action in the 9th Circuit case.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children — not ... to the children of aliens illegally or temporarily in the United States,” top administration top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, wrote in urging the high court’s review.

Attorneys for detainees highlighted the government’s own admissions to longer custody times for immigrant children, contaminated food, a lack of access to medical care or sufficient legal counsel reported by families and monitors at federal facilities, as well as a renewed reliance on hotels for detention.

The attorneys’ reports were filed late Monday in a civil lawsuit launched in 1985 that led to the creation in 1997 of court-ordered supervision of standards and eventually established a 20-day limit in custody. The Trump administration is attempting to end the agreement.

A Dec. 1 report from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement indicated that about 400 immigrant children were held in custody for more than the 20-day limit from August to September. They told the court the problem was widespread and not specific to a region or facility. The primary factors that prolonged their release were categorized into three groups: transportation delays, medical needs, and legal processing.

Legal advocates for the children contended those reasons do not prove lawful justifications for the delays in their release. Through interviews with detained families, advocates identified five children held for 168 days. The report didn’t say how old those children were.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Hotel use for temporary detention is allowed by the federal court for up to 72 hours, but attorneys questioned the government’s data, which they believe did not fully explain why children were held longer than three days in hotel rooms.

Conditions at the detention facilities continued to be an ongoing concern since the family detention site in Dilley, Texas, reopened this year.

Advocates documented injuries suffered by children and a lack of access to sufficient medical care. One child bleeding from an eye injury wasn’t seen by medical staff for two days. Another child’s foot was broken when a member of the staff dropped a volleyball net pole, according to the court filing. “Medical staff told one family whose child got food poisoning to only return if the child vomited eight times,” the advocates wrote in their response.

“Children get diarrhea, heartburn, stomach aches, and they give them food that literally has worms in it,” one person with a family staying at the facility in Dilley wrote in a declaration submitted to the court. Another wrote that they were given “broccoli and cauliflower that were moldy and had worms.”

Chief U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee of the Central District of California is scheduled to have a hearing on the reports next week, where she could decide if the court needs to intervene.

This week’s pick of news and commentary about solitary confinement:

A recent report from Amnesty International found that immigrants housed at “Alligator Alcatraz” and a second Florida detention facility face “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” that may violate international law. The report describes severe overcrowding, lack of medical care, and “alarming” disciplinary practices, including the use of prolonged solitary confinement and a 2-by-2 foot outdoor cage where immigrants are left shackled for days without water. The Guardian | According to the report, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official told Amnesty that the minimum solitary sentence is 24 hours, but that people can be held there for up to 30 days. During a tour of the solitary unit at Krome North Services Processing Center, a man pushed a sign asking for help through the metal flap in his cell door. When an Amnesty staffer stopped to speak with the man, who stated that he has been waiting 37 days to receive medical attention for a broken hand, a guard began to repeatedly smash the man’s injured hand with the metal flap in the door to his solitary cell. Amnesty International is now calling on the United Nations to appoint an independent monitor to investigate both facilities. Florida Phoenix

Over the last decade, thousands of people incarcerated at Florida’s Gulf Coast Correctional Facility (GCCF) have filed complaints of staff abuse and misconduct. Interviews conducted by a team of attorneys and advocates revealed a prolific culture of violence at the facility, which is reinforced by its overuse of solitary confinement. According to the investigation, people in solitary confinement are often punished with property restriction, which involves stripping an individual down to their underwear and removing all items from their cell, or withholding meals.

During his 300 days in solitary confinement, Samuel Smalls realized that the dogs being walked in the yard received more freedom than he did. Smalls is one of 6,000 incarcerated people in Maryland who spent time in solitary confinement in 2024. As the use of solitary confinement continues to increase in Maryland, so has the rate of violent assaults among incarcerated people and by staff. The Baltimore Banner | According to a government report, disciplinary segregation accounted for two-thirds of all solitary confinement placements in 2024—a 38 percent increase from 2023.

At Dauphine County Jail in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, individuals are held in near-constant isolation without access to sunlight or fresh air. Imhotep Muhammad was allowed outside just once during the 26 months he spent in pretrial detention at the jail before being acquitted of the charges against him. As a result of these conditions, Muhammad suffered from severe Vitamin D and B12 deficiency which caused his health to deteriorate even after his release. Muhammad’s only day of outdoor recreation while incarcerated at Dauphine, Labor Day 2024, was the first time in 20 years that people held at the facility were allowed outside. PennLive

In their annual report, the New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson has raised concerns about the fragility of the state’s prison system. Compiling notes from in-person inspections of the state’s nine prisons and testimony from more than one thousand interviews with incarcerated people, the report highlights severe staffing shortages and the continued deterioration of solitary confinement units. According to advocates, the conditions of these units violate the standards of care set by the state’s Isolated Confinement Restriction Act (ICRA) of 2019. NJ.com

After Jerry Cintron overdosed on a fentanyl-laced pill while incarcerated at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC), he refused to cooperate when investigators asked where he got the drugs. In response, through a series of disciplinary hearings, RIDOC determined the appropriate punishment for Cintron was 450 days in solitary confinement. Cintron has since sued RIDOC, claiming that his solitary sentence caused his physical and mental health to deteriorate and officers ignored his appeals for help, which violated his Eighth Amendment rights. The federal First Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled in Cintron’s favor, stating that, while solitary is justified to improve safety, officials “cannot—in the face of that prisoner’s deterioration—perpetuate the kind of social, sensory, and sleep deprivation that Cintron alleges.” Corrections1

Korean Americans Targeted by ICE

•38-year-old arrested, detained: The Korea Daily reports that a Korean-American – who arrived in the US at 3-months-old – was arrested and sent to detention at the Adelanto ICE Detention Center after he and his US citizen wife attended a scheduled interview for family-based residency at US Citizen & Immigration offices in LA. The case is scheduled for a hearing at the end of March 2026. Similar cases involving citizen family-based applicants adjusting status – all with no criminal record – are being reported.

Some cases involve simple address errors. “Attorney Wanseok Oh explained, “In the past, simple overstays by immediate relatives of US citizens were not treated as major issues during interviews, and arrests almost never happened. But since the Trump administration, both adjudication and enforcement have become stricter, and even small issues in an applicant’s older records can lead to arrest at the interview.

Applicants can report address changes online by creating an account at uscis.gov or by mailing the AR-11 form. Each family member must file individually, even if they moved together. Only the applicant’s current address must be listed, regardless of prior moves. Even if the 10-day deadline has passed, attorneys say filing now remains the safest option.”

Oh emphasized, “As immigration policy becomes stricter, even small obligations can lead to real enforcement. Until someone becomes a U.S. citizen, they must manage address updates and record maintenance with much greater diligence.”Until someone becomes a U.S. citizen, they must manage address updates and record maintenance with much greater diligence.””

Scientist and US permanent resident Tae Heung “Will” Kim, 40-years old, who came to the US at age 5, was released Nov 15 after four months in ICE detention. He was arrested and detained with no access to legal council or due process. Department of Homeland Security failed to submit proper documentation justifying his arrest and detention to the court and the case was dismissed. Unlike most cases, Kim’s case received media and national attention which helped in his release.

•Undocumented Immigrants in Orange County (2025 Data)

A report by the USC Equity Research Institute based on data.

The recent attacks on immigrants have harmed communities and sown fear. People are being taken in unmarked vehicles and disappeared without their right to due process. People are not going to work, businesses and restaurants are shutting down, food prices are on the rise, schools, hospitals, and churches are no longer safe.

These raids are devastating our economy, with statewide losses under a scenario of deporting all undocumented workers hovering around $275 billion, caused by labor shortages, delays, increased prices, and decreased business activity. A single raid can destabilize a neighborhood’s entire economy and can have resounding effects to disrupt entire industries. Unable to afford missing work, some force themselves to work in an atmosphere of fear that extends to the families and friends of undocumented immigrants.

The immigration raids ripple through every aspect of our lives and make communities less safe for everyone, not just undocumented immigrants.

Closing the courts The Advocates for Human Rights began their court observation project in 2017, during Trump’s first term, to track immigration court hearings and monitor individual cases.
Immigration court hearings are open to the public, though they can be closed in cases where confidentiality is an issue.
In the past, these details would be removed only for confidential cases, but this is now happening daily, court observers say.
According to Katie Fleming, director of public engagement and education, Fort Snelling Immigration Court is not an outlier when it comes to access issues.","At the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling, judges determine whether immigrants from Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota with asylum claims, removal orders or other immigration claims will be legally allowed to remain in the country.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents now wait in the hallways, too, ready to detain individuals whose cases are increasingly being dismissed in a spate of motions from government attorneys.

There are other, more welcoming, faces as well, including a group of individuals who for eight years have been coming to Fort Snelling to sit in on immigration court hearings and monitor them. They are court observers, belonging to Minnesota organization The Advocates for Human Rights.

These observers have been a constant presence in courtrooms, meticulously documenting immigration hearings to maintain accountability in the immigration system. But in October, a change occurred at Fort Snelling. Clerks told court observers and others that hearings were closed, and doors to publicly available courtrooms were locked. Now, in Fort Snelling and immigration courts across the country, observers say they are increasingly being shut out and unable to observe the proceedings.

Closing the courts

The Advocates for Human Rights began their court observation project in 2017, during Trump’s first term, to track immigration court hearings and monitor individual cases. Since then, trained court observers have been a daily presence at Fort Snelling, taking systematic notes on immigration cases and tracking defendants as they progress through the system. For Madeline Lohman, advocacy and outreach director at The Advocates, the project is a tool for upholding democracy.

“Authoritarianism thrives in secrecy,” Lohman said. “The way governments consolidate power at the expense of the people is that they make their decisions in places that you can’t evaluate whether what they’re saying is true or not.”

The Advocates have consistently had volunteers at Fort Snelling Immigration Court since the project began in 2017, though Lohman says the total number increased significantly after Trump was elected for a second term.

Immigration court hearings generally fall into one of three categories: bond hearings, which determine whether a person will remain in detention during their case; master calendar hearings, procedural hearings to establish immigration charges against defendants; and individual hearings, often referred to as merits hearings, where the final decision on an immigration case is made.

Since October, court observers have frequently shown up to court only to be told that hearings of all types are closed to the public. Doors are now locked by default, unless a judge specifically asks for them to be opened.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, though they can be closed in cases where confidentiality is an issue. Judges also have discretion to close hearings to protect any party in the case, witnesses, or the public interest, even if the hearing would otherwise be public. Judges were slow to exercise this power in the past however, with the public generally allowed access to the majority of hearings.

Amy Lange, head of The Advocates’ court observation project, said it was rare for the public to be shut out of master calendar hearings in particular.

“We would see one of those every three months, and now this is on a daily basis,” Lange said. “There are times now when an observer will show up to court and they will say a judge is closing a courtroom for the entire day.”

Lange identified four instances since October where master calendar hearings were closed for at least the entire morning case docket, with hearings being closed the entire day of Oct. 27. She said staff from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which manages the nation’s immigration courts, has cited confidentiality as the reason for closing master calendar hearings, which overwhelmingly deal with pleadings, scheduling, and other matters not specific to an individual’s case.

“I don’t understand why a master calendar hearing would be closed to the public,” she said. “By their definition, they’re procedural.”

Merits hearings have also been increasingly closed to the public. While these individual hearings have historically been more likely to be closed to the public for confidentiality purposes, Lange says it was typically done at the behest of the defendant. She identified at least three instances since October that merits hearings were closed off to the public without individual consideration, including one in which the client’s attorney had granted permission in advance for court observers to be present.

For Lange, this increase in closed hearings raises alarm over court accountability.

“You have to operate consistently, transparently and accountably,” she said. “We have to wonder if that’s happening when closures are unexplained and indiscriminate.”

In addition to closing hearings, case dockets have increasingly been stripped of identifying details, making them difficult to track. Names are frequently removed, making it harder for both the public and respondents to get updates on cases. In the past, these details would be removed only for confidential cases, but this is now happening daily, court observers say.

Fort Snelling security has also replaced EOIR staff as the party responsible for admitting the public into the courtroom. Because these guards are not EOIR employees, they are unable to communicate with judges unless directly called. Lange said this has led to breakdowns in communication between courtrooms and observers.

To date, EOIR has not issued any policies or memos dictating additional closures of public courtrooms. A November fact sheet issued by EOIR says that judges can close a hearing based on a request from any party in the case; if the judge needs to limit attendance; or if closing the court is required by law.

The fact sheet also states that Webex links for hearings are reserved for parties appearing remotely. The public had previously been able to observe hearings remotely.

In an email to Sahan Journal, EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly cited the fact sheet as justification for increased hearing closures although it did not spell out any rationale for the change. She did not respond to Sahan’s questions about why court employees are locking courtroom doors by default and using guards rather than EOIR staff to communicate with judges.

The big picture

Across the country, immigration courts are putting similar restrictions in place.

The Acacia Center for Justice, a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit, has been connecting with court observation groups nationwide to coordinate efforts and improve information sharing. According to Katie Fleming, director of public engagement and education, Fort Snelling Immigration Court is not an outlier when it comes to access issues.

Fleming said courts in many states have experienced similar issues. In her home city of Sacramento, there have been blanket denials of public access to court buildings, including the news media. Immigration court officials have also accused observers of loitering or soliciting as justification for keeping them out of the courtroom or courthouse hallways, and they have prohibited observers from talking to respondents in the hallways or sharing supporting resources with them.

Fleming said that court restrictions are being enforced inconsistently, even within the same state. To Fleming, these actions serve a clear purpose.

“It is my understanding and my belief that the administration is trying to limit public access to courtrooms because court observers can and will hold them accountable for due process violations,” she said.

Fleming added that court observers can make a tangible impact on cases.

“It can have an effect on the outcome of the case to have folks in the courtroom,” she said. “Whether it helps judges to be on their best behavior or be more thorough or the government attorney to be on better behavior, it is important to have those observers present.”

Observers from The Advocates for Human Rights will continue showing up at Fort Snelling Immigration Court. To Lohman, doing so is a fundamental responsibility of democracy. How much they will be able to see remains unclear.

“If you can’t gather independent verifiable information, then the government gets to say whatever they want about what’s happening and you can’t use the democratic process to hold them accountable,” Lohman said. “You’ve been stripped of your ability to know what’s happening and react.”",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhippleBuilding-9290.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:57:01.223470

And of course, persons don’t lose their human rights because of an irregular arrival.
This misses the idea of the Convention which is not about democratic majorities but about human rights: rights that are independent from someone’s citizenship and that are not at the discretion of the majority.
Firstly, the Court did not hear many cases during the existence of the European Commission of Human Rights.","As we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the topic of migration stands at the center of concerns about the Convention’s state of health. In this blogpost adapted from my remarks at a Conference in the Federal Ministry for Justice and Consumer Protection, I argue that those attacking the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for an over-reaching jurisprudence regarding migrants’ rights misconstrue the actual case law. It is worth looking back at the early landmark cases to understand that the interpretation of Article 3 in relation to expulsion and deportation cases developed cautiously. While a critique of the Court’s decisions is the legitimate task of legal scholarship, simplistic narratives about an activist Court fail to engage with its doctrinal stringency.

Open threats to the Convention

One of the foremost birthday wishes is the wish for good health. So, as we are celebrating the ECHR’s 75th anniversary, I would like to wish good health to the European Convention on Human Rights. To take care of someone’s health, wishes are not enough though – it also needs doctor visits. In some way, interrogating the area of migration and the ECHR resembles a doctor visit, because in no other area is the health of the Convention so much at risk as it is in the area of migration.

A most evident threat to the Convention’s health is the “lettera aperta”, the open letter initiated by Denmark and Italy and signed by a total of nine European heads of state. The letter openly calls for a politically motivated restrictive interpretation of migrants’ rights and, in its assumptions, breaks with the spirit of universality of human rights. One of the many astonishing misconceptions of the lettera aperta is that it tells a story about two groups of migrants: those who come regularly, integrate well and contribute to the societies, and those who come irregularly, don’t integrate and in some cases commit crimes. To juxtapose those categories is out of touch with the reality, in which irregular pathways are the only possibility and therefore normal for most of those seeking international protection. Already the 1951 Refugee Convention reacts to this reality with its principle of non-penalization. The persisting attempt to denigrate asylum seekers for the irregularity of their arrival is at odds with the core of international refugee law. And of course, persons don’t lose their human rights because of an irregular arrival. The lettera aperta also repeatedly refers to “our citizens” whose opinions it claims to represent. This misses the idea of the Convention which is not about democratic majorities but about human rights: rights that are independent from someone’s citizenship and that are not at the discretion of the majority. Finally, the plea that there should be “more room nationally to decide on when to expel criminal foreign nationals” misses the nature of human rights protection: The basic limitations that the Convention sets for expelling persons are the limits of Article 3 ECHR, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. This prohibition applies regardless of a criminal record. It is hard to see how “more room to decide” can be understood other than wishing to depart from this universal and unconditional prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.

The successive interpretation of Article 3 ECHR in the field of migration

In defense of the lettera aperta and in other criticism of the Court, the argument is sometimes made that the jurisprudence in the field of migration has been expansive. Common knowledge about the Article 3 ECHR case law is that protection against expulsion goes back to the Soering case from 1989. Soering, a German national, was facing extradition from the UK to the USA for charges of murder. The ECtHR ruled that the potential exposure to death row would constitute inhuman or degrading treatment and that the Convention therefore prohibited an extradition. With this ruling, the Court made clear that Article 3 prohibits delivering persons under the jurisdiction of a Convention state to another state where the person faces torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The scope of the prohibition extends beyond direct acts of the state – which is also recognized for scenarios in which the state is responsible if it fails to prevent attacks from non-state actors.

Soering was not a case of migrants’ rights, but it created the ground for Article 3 ECHR jurisprudence regarding expulsions. It should not be surprising that this jurisprudence began several years after the Convention entered into force. Firstly, the Court did not hear many cases during the existence of the European Commission of Human Rights. Secondly, the late 1980s and early 1990s were the period in migrants’ rights gained a practical relevance as defense against the “emerging politics of non-entrée” (Hathaway 1992). During the 1990s, a few cases followed in which the Court interpreted the protection against expulsion under Article 3 ECHR.

The first case after Soering was the case Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden (1991). It concerned a Chilean family of three who had applied for political asylum in Sweden. Their claim had been rejected and they faced expulsion, when the case was brought before the ECtHR. The Court confirmed that Article 3 ECHR is applicable in expulsion cases, but did not find a violation, arguing that there was not sufficient evidence that the applicants faced torture or inhuman or degrading treatment if deported. Judge de Meyer dissented with the majority and suggested that Article 3 ECHR had been violated, relying also on the general situation in Chile in 1989.

In another decision from 1991, in the case Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, the Court equally confirmed the applicability of Article 3 ECHR to asylum seekers while finding no violation. The applicants were Tamils who had fled Sri Lanka and applied for protection in the UK. The ECtHR held that the situation they faced when returned did not meet the threshold of Article 3 ECHR, with Judge Russo dissenting.

The next decision about protection against expulsion was in the case Chahal v. the United Kingdom in 1996. It concerned a family of four, the parents being Indian citizens and the adult children being British citizens. The parents had been in the UK since 1974 and 1975, and the father, Mr. Chahal, was a leading figure in the Sikh community. He had been charged for terrorist activities but not convicted; nonetheless, a deportation order was based on the fight against terrorism. The Court, sitting as the Grand Chamber, held that the deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 ECHR because as a politically active Sikh, Mr. Chahal, would face inhuman or degrading treatment in India.

After this first decision in which a violation of Article 3 ECHR prohibited a deportation, an inadmissibility decision followed in the case T.I. v. the United Kingdom in 2000. The applicant was a Sri Lankan national to be removed from the UK to Germany. The Court held that the removal order from the UK without consideration of the asylum claim in substance did not give rise to an admissible claim under Article 3 ECHR because the applicant would be able to again claim asylum in Germany and did not risk immediate removal to Sri Lanka.

In Saadi v. Italy (2008), the ECtHR, sitting as Grand Chamber, held that the expulsion of Mr. Saadi, a Tunisian national, would violate Article 3 ECHR because of the risk of torture in Tunisia. Mr. Saadi had been prosecuted and jailed in Italy. The Italian government had sought assurances from Tunisia that he would not face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Such assurance was not given and the Court stressed that even if given, this would not have been sufficient alone because Italy had to assess the risk of a violation of Article 3 ECHR based on all available facts.

Returning to – when?

When I read the call for “more room” to decide nationally about the expulsion of criminal foreign nationals, I wonder if the authors mean that they disagree with the ruling in the Saadi case, and I would like to hear why and how they think the case should have been decided. When I hear a colleague suggest we should return to an earlier state of interpretation of Article 3 in the area of migration, I wonder to which state and why? The Court did not “invent” the protection against deporting someone to conditions of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment with Soering, nor did it invent it with Chahal or with Saadi. The Court interpreted the Convention. One can disagree with the interpretation but that would require some doctrinal legal arguments. Criticism of the Court’s jurisprudence should have some basis in the Convention’s text and rules of interpretation.

Judicial decisions are not taken in a political vacuum, but they also cannot be reduced to political choices. If political leaders try to reduce them to such, there should be collective resistance of all who believe in the worth of an independent judiciary.

And yes, there can be reasonable disagreement about legal interpretations. But we can only have a viable discussion based on concrete cases and interpretative alternatives, not based on abstract calls for a “more restrictive approach”. Do those calls refer to protection against deportation in cases of severe illness? Do they disagree with the ruling in case D. v. the UK (1997)? Did they notice the restrictive decisions in the cases B.B. v. France (1998) and N. v. the UK (2008)? Does the disagreement begin with later decisions in Paposhvili or Savran, and if so why?

Silent threats to the Convention’s health

Besides the open threats to the Convention, there is also the more silent disregard of the Convention’s requirements and the Court’s rulings. The ECtHR continuously holds states such as Hungary and Greece accountable for the violations of migrants’ rights, in particular due to arbitrary detention and due to inhuman and degrading treatment in camps. The numerous decisions per year do not make headlines, they do not advance new interpretations but simply apply, again and again, the Convention’s standards against state actions that violate them. I have written before about the problem of this disregard for the ECHR requirements. The Court cannot resolve this problem, it requires a broad coalition of legal and political institutions as well as civil society that uphold pressure for the Convention to be respected. This broad coalition is the Convention’s immune system.

The 75th anniversary is a helpful occasion to recall these urgent contributions we can all make to protect the European Convention on Human Rights: reaffirm the universality of its guarantees, rebut attacks on judicial independence and call for respect of the Convention, pressing states to address structural violations.",https://www.ein.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/immigration_word.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 10:57:36.900712

Sue Tincher said she heard ICE was conducting an operation in her neighborhood around 6:30 in the morning. She said she was an observer and wanted to find out what was going on. When she asked what the agents were doing, she said she was told to stand back. She didn't, and was detained.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security began what they called ""Operation Metro Surge."" Twelve people were taken into custody during the operation, DHS said. There have been continued reports since then of ICE in the Twin Cities, including in Burnsville, where family members told KARE 11 ICE detained four people over the weekend.

ICE posted on social media Tuesday a video showing of multiple arrests, with the caption ""Minnesota's weather is cloudy with a 100% chance of ICE.""

The Northside Residents Redevelopment Council says three others were detained in the raid at which Tincher was detained. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not commented publicly on this incident.

Tincher said when she was detained, she was pushed down into the snow and put into an unmarked vehicle as she yelled for help. She said she was taken to the Whipple Federal Building and held for four hours.

Her husband, Jim Tincher, told media he didn't know where they took his wife. He said he called city councilors, Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Sen. Tina Smith for help. He said he never found out where she was until she called him.

""I knew she would come back, a lot of families don't know what,"" Jim Tincher said.

The ICE immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss is at the center of the controversy.
There are currently about 3,000 people detained at the immigration detention facility, Escobar said.","U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar is a co-sponsor of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act.

The bill aims to improve conditions and oversight at immigrant detention facilities, including at Camp East Montana in El Paso.

Key provisions in the bill require establishing minimum civil detention standards and allowing unannounced congressional inspections.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar has joined forces with other congressional leaders in an attempt to establish ""crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections"" for the thousands of immigrants being held in public and private detention facilities.

Escobar is a co-sponsor of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act that looks to improve conditions within immigrant detention facilities across the country — including one of the largest lockups in El Paso.

The bill aims to improve congressional oversight of the sites, which have seen increasing accusations of human rights violations and inhumane conditions.

Key provisions in the bill would give members of Congress access to detention facilities for unannounced inspections and establish civil detention standards that match or exceed the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards.

The bill was presented by its authors U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Adam Smith, both Democrats from Washington state, on Dec. 3.

“I have seen firsthand the consequences of incompetence, cruelty and inhumane treatment that flourishes when private prison corporations are allowed to profit off suffering, including at Camp East Montana,” Escobar, D-El Paso, said in a statement. “The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act is an urgent and necessary step toward ending such abuse that’s central to the Trump administration. I’m grateful to Representatives Jayapal and Smith for introducing this bill which establishes crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections that this administration has systematically dismantled.”

There are 123 co-sponsors. It is also endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Haitian Bridge Alliance and Refugees International, among many others immigrant advocacy groups.

The bill would:

Repeal mandatory detention

Prohibit the detention of families and children in family detention

Create a presumption of release and impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, survivors of torture or gender-based violence, people with serious mental or physical illness or disability, LGBTQ individuals, asylum seekers, and people over age 60

Phase out the use of private detention facilities and jails over a three-year period

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards that provide, at minimum, the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards

Mandate the DHS Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections with meaningful penalties for failure to comply with standards

Require DHS to admit members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

“People are being held in squalor, largely in private, for-profit detention facilities, all to pad the bottom lines of prison corporations that donate to Donald Trump and Republicans,"" Jayapal said announcing the act. ""As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse. We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.”

There are currently nearly 70,000 people detained across the U.S., the majority of whom have no criminal convictions.

The legislative measure comes as Escobar and other immigrants rights advocates have raised grave concern over the conditions within immigration detention facilities.

The ICE immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss is at the center of the controversy.

Congressional concern over the Camp East Montana detention center

Escobar has continued to express her concern about the conditions at the Camp East Montana immigration detention facility, which ICE opened on land that belongs to Fort Bliss Army Post.

She has carried out three oversight visits to the facility since it began receiving detained migrants on Aug. 1, and sent at least two letters to the Department of Homeland Security over concerns about the conditions in the facility. Her concerns include inadequate medical attention — with detainees not receiving their medication — unsanitary conditions where detainees have requested equipment to clean their spaces, and poor quality to rotten food.

Escobar sent a letter to Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, in November expressing her concerns about the facility. She stated then that ""conditions at Camp East Montana are dangerous and inhumane.""

The congresswoman made her latest visit to the facility on Dec. 1. She found that many of the issues that she discovered during her earlier visits have not been addressed.

""Not only is there no process being made on the issues I have raised,"" Escobar told the El Paso Times. ""But it is clear to me that the contractors are either cutting corners to create bigger profit for themselves or that the contractors are not competent.""

The facility is set to be the largest in the country, ultimately housing 5,000 detainees. The Trump administration granted over $1.2 billion dollars for its construction.

There are currently about 3,000 people detained at the immigration detention facility, Escobar said. And many of the immigrants detained at the El Paso immigration are being taken directly to the sprawling detention camp following their hearings, court observers said.

During her last visit, Escobar was able to speak with 10 women in the facility.

Escobar detailed that she has consistently heard that detainees are being forced to wash their own clothes, they are not being provided with adequate hygiene products and detainees have continued to receive food that is either foul tasting or rotten. The women she spoke with also reported having developed rashes due to the alcohol-based gel they have used to wash their clothing.

Escobar noted that some immigrants she has spoken with have been detained for nearly two months. Originally, the facility was meant to hold immigrants for up to five days.

""These are human beings who deserve to be treated as human beings,"" the congresswoman said. ""Even if there are people who do not care about the humanitarian component of my concerns, then why should be outraged that a contractor that is getting $1.24 billion dollars of taxpayer money is not meeting the obligations that they should be meeting.""

Calls to shut down Camp East Montana

The ACLU and other immigrant rights advocacy groups, including El Paso's Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Estrella del Paso, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement urging officials to cease detaining immigrants in the soft-sided detention facility.

Detainees held in the facility have told lawyers about the squalid conditions and human rights violations in the camps, the ACLU reports. The letter details the horrid conditions in the facility, including ""beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations.""

The letter recounts the story of four Cuban immigrants held in the facility who reported being beaten by guards after refusing to be deported to Mexico. It also recounts the experience of one detainee, Samuel, who had his ""testicles crushed"" by a guard and was beaten to the point where he was taken in an ambulance from the facility.

The ACLU letter is the latest in a series of reports highlighting the dire conditions at the facility. It echoes and cites similar concerns Escobar has expressed and internal ICE inspectors reports of violations.

The Washington Post reported in September that the detention facility was found to have no less than 60 violations in 50 days as the Trump administration expands the facility. Detainees were subjected to conditions that violated federal standards for immigrant detention, according to a report produced by ICE inspectors.

Inspectors found the facility failed to properly monitor and treat some detainees’ medical conditions, lacked basic procedures for keeping guards and detainees safe and inadequately provided detainees with proper means to communicate with legal representation.","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PTX1/85714710007-180820256-d-8-a-6521.jpg?crop=5759,3241,x0,y299&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 10:57:40.241448

Ultimately, CBP plans to require ESTA applicants to submit applications solely through the ESTA Mobile application and will decommission the ESTA application website.","U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is planning to make several changes to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application process used by business visitors and tourists to visit the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including the addition of a social media review and the requirement to provide greater detail on the applicant’s personal information and family members.

The intended changes are detailed in a CBP notice set for publication in the Federal Register (FR) on December 10. The public has 60 days from FR publication to comment on the planned changes, which also include the plan for a new optional mobile tool for any foreign national to record their departure from the United States.

According to the FR notice, CBP is planning the following changes to the ESTA application process:

Mandatory social media information collection. CBP is planning to add social media as a mandatory data element for an ESTA application and will require applicants to provide their social media information from the five years preceding their application.

Additional required personal information. CBP intends to add several data fields to the ESTA application “when feasible,” including:

Telephone numbers used by applicant in the preceding five years;

Email addresses used by applicant in the preceding ten years;

IP addresses and metadata from electronically submitted photos;

Family member names (parents, spouse, siblings, children) and dates and places of birth;

Family telephone numbers used in the preceding five years;

Family member residences;

Biometrics – face, fingerprint, DNA, and iris;

Business telephone numbers used by the applicant in the preceding five years; and

Business email addresses used by the applicant in the preceding ten years.

Separate photo upload requirement. CBP is planning to update the ESTA website and ESTA mobile application to always require the upload of a photograph of the applicant’s face, in addition to the photo of the passport biographical page. Currently, the ESTA website does not require a separate photo upload and the ESTA Mobile application only requires the photo in certain instances.

ESTA application website decommission; ESTA Mobile as sole application option. Ultimately, CBP plans to require ESTA applicants to submit applications solely through the ESTA Mobile application and will decommission the ESTA application website. The ESTA website would remain available as an information resource for the VWP program and as a tool for ESTA applicants to check the status of their submitted ESTA applications, but applicants would be required to use the ESTA Mobile application to apply for ESTA. CBP cites certain technological limitations of the ESTA website as the basis for the planned change.

Apart from the ESTA changes, CBP also plans to implement an optional new functionality within the CBP Home mobile application that would allow foreign nationals to provide evidence of their departure from the United States. If a foreign national chooses to record their departure through the mobile application, they will be required to submit their facial image and CBP will use geolocation services to confirm that the foreign national is outside the United States. The agency will also run “liveness detection” software on the uploaded facial image to determine that the photo is a live photo as opposed to a previously uploaded one. If a foreign national chooses to submit evidence of their departure, the report of the exit would be recorded as a confirmed departure in the CBP Arrival and Departure System (ADIS).

CBP will accept public comments on the planned ESTA and departure record changes for 60 days after publication in the December 10 Federal Register notice. If the changes are then approved by the Office of Management and Budget, CBP may implement the changes in stages over the following weeks and months.

ESTA applicants should be aware that if these changes are finalized, they would be asked for a higher level of personal detail in future applications and become subject to a social media review by CBP. The increase in data collection could also mean that ESTA applicants would face an increased likelihood of being flagged for closer scrutiny and/or would experience longer waits for ESTA approval.

The chief of the body which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) said ministers had taken an “important first step forward together” to agree a political declaration on migration and the ECHR.
He said: “This is really the starting of a process on a consensus basis... “All 46 member states have reaffirmed their deep and abiding commitment to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.
The ECHR, which underpins Britain’s Human Rights Act, is seen by its critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants from the country.
“Human rights were never meant to be optional or reserved for comfortable and secure times.","The prime minister has urged Europe’s leaders to reform how a major human rights treaty is interpreted in law to tackle illegal migration and prevent voters from turning to “the forces that seek to divide us"".

Sir Keir Starmer and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, have made a joint call on other leaders across the continent to agree on a “modernisation” of how the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is interpreted in their countries’ laws.

European ministers agreed at a meeting in Strasbourg on Wednesday that they will look at how to tackle concerns over migration within the legal framework.

Deputy PM David Lammy, who is at the meeting, said the convention ""was never intended to be frozen in time,"" and warned that the definition of ""family life"" should not be stretched ""to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country”.

The chief of the body which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) said ministers had taken an “important first step forward together” to agree a political declaration on migration and the ECHR.

Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Berset told reporters that the “living instrument” is possible to adapt, and work will begin to adopt the declaration in Moldova in May 2026.

He said: “This is really the starting of a process on a consensus basis...

“All 46 member states have reaffirmed their deep and abiding commitment to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.

“This is not rhetoric. This is a political decision of the highest order.

“But ministers have also expressed their concerns regarding the unprecedented challenges posed by migration and the serious questions governments face in maintaining societies that deliver for citizens.”

In an opinion piece for the Guardian newspaper, Starmer and Frederiksen advocated for a tougher approach to policing Europe’s borders as a means of winning against populist political opponents, saying they were “making this case across Europe”.

The ECHR, which underpins Britain’s Human Rights Act, is seen by its critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants from the country.

The right to family life, enshrined by Article 8 of the agreement, is often used as grounds in legal cases to prevent removals.

The Home Office has also said it has seen a trend of Article 3 rights, prohibiting torture, being used to halt deportations because of claims that migrants’ healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Starmer’s political opponents, the Conservatives and Reform UK, have both said they would leave the ECHR if in power.

The prime minister, in his joint op-ed with Fredriksen, acknowledged the “current asylum framework was created for another era”, adding: “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed, and asylum systems must change with it.”

Despite opponents' stated intention to leave the ECHR, Starmer's government has insisted it will remain a member of the treaty, and has adopted a series of hardline immigration measures, modelled on those spearheaded by Frederiksen’s Danish government.

“Migration must be orderly, managed and sustainable. Irregular routes should not be the go-to option – so we must dismantle the human smuggling networks that prey on desperation.

“Together, we are calling on our friends across Europe to go further in tackling these shared challenges,” the two leaders wrote.

They continued, describing a “push for a modernisation of the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights – so that the convention system, which we believe in, can evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.”

In a warning to other leaders, Starmer and Fredriksen added: “Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.

“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”

The Government is expected to bring forward homegrown legislation to change how the Article 8 right to family life is interpreted in UK courts, and is also considering examining the threshold for Article 3 rights.

Amnesty International UK hit out at UK plans to lead reforms of the ECHR, describing it as weakening protections.

Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “There is a dreadful irony in our Justice Secretary working with his counterparts to remove or reduce rights on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

""It shows how far we have drifted from the moral resolve of the last century, when our grandparents determined that the fact we are all born free and equal must be protected in law.

“Human rights were never meant to be optional or reserved for comfortable and secure times. They were designed to be a compass, our conscience, when the politics of fear and division try to steer us wrong.

""To weaken ECHR protections now, on a day meant to reaffirm dignity and protection for all, is not reform. It is moral retreat.”

Elsewhere, French far-right leader Jordan Bardella told the Daily Telegraph newspaper he would rewrite French border policy to allow British patrol boats to push back migrant dinghies into France’s waters, if he led the country.

At issue is Senate Bill 76 — authored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, after she blocked a bill with some similar provisions during the last legislative session. That move resulted in Rokita claiming she did so because she has an “illegal alien” in her family.

Her current proposal includes language allowing state agencies and Rokita’s office to investigate the “employment of an unauthorized alien” and report possible violations to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Indiana Department of Labor.

Rokita, however, is backing a differing proposal in Senate Bill 122, which would give the attorney general’s office authority to seek court orders suspending an “employer’s operating authorizations” over such suspected violations.

Rokita, a Republican, blasted Brown on social media over her bill, saying she had “introduced a watered-down, bizarro world version … that takes all the enforcement teeth out of the bill. That makes her bill meaningless.”

Brown countered that she has worked with entities from the Trump administration to county sheriffs in order to find effective ways to help enforce federal immigration laws.

“The biggest thing is making sure that we didn’t grow government and that the power isn’t centered in one agency or individual,” Brown told reporters.

Hiring practices in question

Erin Tuttle, the attorney general office’s legislative director, criticized Brown’s bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally.

“The Supreme Court has confirmed that states may sanction the license of employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers,” Tuttle said. “If Indiana refuses to adopt the one enforcement mechanism available under federal law, it cannot credibly claim to be a leader in combating illegal immigration.”

Immigrant advocates, however, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation.

Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, told committee members that the proposal encourages racial profiling by businesses.

“It pushes them toward discriminatory hiring practices, meaning someone who fits a certain look or has a certain name or has an accent may be discriminated against, just out of precaution,” Castoreno said. “We know who is harmed, people with brown skin, people with accents, people with names that sound unfamiliar to an HR manager.”

Committee members voted 6-2 along party lines to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in early January.

Rokita-Brown conflict continues

The dispute between Rokita and Brown over the legislation grows out of their conflict over an immigration-enforcement bill from the legislative session earlier this year.

House members approved House Bill 1531 in February, but Brown did not hold a Senate committee hearing on the bill and it died when the legislative session ended in April.

Rokita then claimed Brown had blocked the legislation because she had a “family member who’s an illegal alien.”

Brown called that claim “blatantly false.” She also filed an attorney misconduct grievance over Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission that she said Tuesday was still pending.

Rokita and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over last session’s bill.

They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a Republican primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.

Following the committee vote, Rokita posted to X that the bill “would actively shield sanctuary jurisdictions and directly undermines our ongoing lawsuits to end sanctuary policies in Monroe and St. Joseph counties. We need to stop illegal immigration—not protect the counties and officials who defy state law and put Hoosier families last.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/D098C92B-C8DB-492D-AAE5-016023084083_1_201_a-2048x1364.jpeg,N,,2025-12-10 09:57:19.452017

Today, the U.S. government needs to take a hard look in the mirror.

The U.S. human rights record has been far from spotless, but under President Donald Trump, attacks on human rights at home and abroad have escalated on an alarming scale. From targeting protestors to treating immigrants cruelly, from sending militarized forces into our communities to extrajudicially killing (murdering) more than 80 people in the Caribbean and Pacific, the Trump administration’s assault on human rights must stop.

As we mark Human Rights Day, we refuse to idly stand by. Human rights are universal; they belong to everybody, everywhere, all the time, just by virtue of their being human. The Trump administration may dismiss them, but we will not. Across the country, millions of people are demanding accountability and respect for human rights. Their courage is a reminder that we must never normalize this assault.

Authoritarian Practices, Eroded Rights

Since President Trump took office, authoritarian practices and contempt for the rule of law have surged dramatically. His administration has targeted universities—crushing student protests and threatening academic freedom. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester and negotiator at Columbia University detained for months before a judge ordered his release, still faces ongoing immigration proceedings. His only “offense” was exercising his right to freedom of expression. Targeting and threatening peaceful protesters and their immigration status is a clear violation of human rights. This administration’s message is unmistakable: dissent, and you risk punishment, detention or deportation.

Khalil’s case is not unique. At least 10 international students and activists have faced similar targeting for Palestinian rights advocacy, including Leqaa Kordia, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman detained since March 13, 2025, after a protest at Columbia University. She must be released immediately.

Journalists have also been targeted. Reporter Mario Guevara, detained in June for covering a protest in Georgia, was deported in October. This sends a chilling message to every journalist in the United States: reporting the truth can get you jailed or thrown out of this country.

Immigrants are being detained without warrants or due process, at historic levels in inhumane and cruel conditions. I recently met with lawyers and people previously detained in the Everglades Detention Facility, known as “Alligator Alcatraz” who shared devastating reports of torture, denial of medical care and inhumane conditions without access to attorneys. At a visit to the Krome North Service Processing Center, another immigrant detention center in Florida, I saw these conditions with my owns eyes and spoke to people detained who said they’ve “lived through hell.”

Militarized forces have taken over city streets—especially threatening to brown and Black communities—even as local officials and some federal judges demanded President Trump stop. Masked federal officers have conducted nighttime raids, terrorizing entire neighborhoods and taking people without warrants. Children are torn from their parents, and people who have come to our border seeking safety are denied their right to seek asylum.People who have protested these heavy-handed enforcement tactics are met with law enforcement in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets.

These are not policy disputes—they are human rights violations.

President Trump is trying to silence dissent by invoking fear everywhere. I was one of the 7 million people protesting in October refusing to give up our rights. We, the people mobilizing to defend our rights, are growing in number and power!

Human Rights Transcend Politics

Human rights are not about left or right. They’re about right and wrong. They protect the human dignity and safety of every person. If we stay silent as rights are violated and denied, the question isn’t ifmore violations will follow, but when.

Now is the time for collective action. We are in this together. We inspire each other by protesting, speaking out and joining local movements that defend those whose rights are being violated. Colleges and universities must safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment. Lawmakers must hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. The United States must also reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems.

The adoption of the UDHR on December 10, 1948, recognized human rights as the foundation for freedom, justice and peace. All people everywhere have a right to live their lives freely, equally and in dignity. We can, and we must, do better. The path forward begins with accountability, courage and collective action—from those who lead our government and from each of us. On this day, and every day, let us raise our voices and demand that the United States do what is right.

“An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action,” DeSantis said, responding to a post urging the state to challenge Trump’s would-be executive order.
Stewart said that Trump’s executive order would amount to a federal takeover of AI regulation before there’s a comprehensive federal standard in place.
Trump’s Justice Department has taken extensive steps to keep these attorneys in their roles, but Habba’s resignation marks a reality check for the administration.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.","President Trump’s promised executive order that would kneecap state laws aimed at regulating artificial intelligence is likely bound for the courts.

The president announced his plan Monday to create “one rulebook” by which the tech industry will abide when it comes to AI, a move that would override the regulations passed by individual states.

“We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS!” he continued. “AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!”

But it could face legal headwinds and criticism off the bat, especially as AI regulation is still a fledgling effort.

“A great federal system could be better, in theory,” said Nicholas E. Stewart, executive director of the Justice Education Project. “But in practice, without a system in place, states are only really the ones filling the gaps.”

All 50 states — plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands — introduced legislation this year on AI, and some 38 states adopted or enacted about 100 measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

That patchwork of state laws could come under fire with an executive order from Trump.

Though it’s not clear what the final order will look like, a draft order seen last month by our colleague, tech reporter extraordinaire Julia Shapero, would have created a task force dedicated to challenging state AI laws and restricted certain broadband funding for states with AI laws deemed overly burdensome.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who last week proposed an AI “bill of rights” for his state, wrote on X Monday that any effort by the president to “preempt” states’ actions by overriding their laws — as Trump’s post seems to suggest — would be unlawful.

“An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action,” DeSantis said, responding to a post urging the state to challenge Trump’s would-be executive order. “Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation.”

Either way, legal challenges seem inevitable — and the Trump administration could quickly run into issues.

There’s one big problem to start: At least one of the tech companies that might celebrate lesser regulation, OpenAI, has acknowledged that “federal preemption over existing or prospective state laws will require an act of Congress.”

The admission came in the footnote of a submission to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy and could be used by legal challengers to undermine the foundation and authority of Trump’s efforts.

More generally, as DeSantis noted, an order overwriting state laws could pose questions about the separation of powers between both Congress and the executive branch, and strains on federalism.

Federal lawmakers last week did reintroduce the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act, which aims to bar companies from using “biased and discriminatory AI-powered algorithms” in making “critical decisions” for American lives.

But the regulation of AI is still in early stages, and efforts to crack down on emergent technology have major gaps. That’s especially true of regulation of AI’s impact on the justice system, according to Stewart.

Stewart, lead author of the book “Next Steps into Criminal Justice Activism: Technology, Ethics, and the Future of Justice,” which publishes next Tuesday, told The Gavel in an interview that AI is already built into every stage of policing, which prosecutors now use to build timelines, case theories and arguments as opposed to human witnesses.

“Policing and prosecution are being quietly rewritten by systems that don’t think, can’t explain themselves and are not accountable to anyone,” Stewart said. “And when you remove people from key decisions, handing those decisions to generative AI, you don’t get neutrality — you get automation of the same biases and power imbalances that already exist, except they’re only faster, quieter and harder to challenge.”

The book, which was shaped by the Gen Z-led Justice Education Project, includes chapters dedicated to interviews with legal experts at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania detailing the dangers of leaving AI’s spread into the legal system unaddressed, especially for communities already disproportionately affected by heavy policing.

Columbia University professor Daniel Richman — who, loyal readers may know just-so-happens to play a key role in the Justice Department’s dismissed case against former FBI Director James Comey — told the authors in one chapter, shared with The Gavel ahead of publication, that an “invisible system” like these can inflict harm just as well, with fewer questions asked.

“Anytime you expand data collection, you risk widening the net of the criminal justice system,” Richman said.

(We’d be remiss not to mention: Richman’s bid to temporarily block DOJ from accessing his own data, which prosecutors relied on to argue he was authorized by Comey to make disclosures to the media, was on Saturday granted by a judge.)

Stewart said that Trump’s executive order would amount to a federal takeover of AI regulation before there’s a comprehensive federal standard in place.

“So, as the administration moves ahead, we can see the strongest state-level safeguards — especially around discrimination, privacy and surveillance — overridden overnight, potentially,” he said. “And that would shift enormous power to Washington and to the tech companies building these systems (in) Silicon Valley, leaving communities with fewer tools to challenge harmful uses of AI in the justice system.”

IN FOCUS

Trump hits wall with US attorneys

Trump’s bid to install loyalist U.S. attorneys in top offices nationwide seems to have hit a dead end, as his Justice Department’s efforts to keep embattled prosecutors in their positions have faltered.

“It’s a very sad situation,” the president said Monday. “We’re losing a lot of great people.”

His remarks came after his former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, stepped down as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey after a panel of federal appeals court judges ruled she was unlawfully serving in the role.

Habba was the first of his loyalist U.S. attorneys to be ruled disqualified in July, but others followed.

The top federal prosecutors in Nevada, the California district including Los Angeles and the Virginia district that includes D.C.’s suburbs have all since been found to be unlawfully holding their posts, while a challenge to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York is pending — and a judge signaled it’s one the federal prosecutor may lose.

Trump’s Justice Department has taken extensive steps to keep these attorneys in their roles, but Habba’s resignation marks a reality check for the administration.

Habba said in her announcement that the decision was to protect the “stability and integrity” of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, saying judges stopped holding trials and handing down sentences with her at the helm, “leaving violent criminals on the streets.”

Court watchers have largely attributed the disruptions to confusion around the legality of her leadership, but the consequences have been real. The New York Times reported in August that the delays were wreaking havoc on the lives of those whose lives were tied up in New Jersey’s federal courts, and the appeals court ruling came only on Dec. 1.

A similar story is playing out in the Eastern District of Virginia, where the name of Lindsey Halligan — the disqualified U.S. attorney — is still appearing on court filings.

Several outlets have reported judges pushing back from the bench, questioning why a federal judge’s ruling that found Halligan never lawfully served as the district’s top prosecutor would not preclude her participation in cases.

One of those judges, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, oversaw Comey’s case at the trial level and Halligan’s disqualification was the reason for its dismissal. He ordered her name struck from a different man’s case records and said he was finding it “difficult to reconcile” the disqualification ruling with the Justice Department’s actions now, according to CNN.

The Justice Department hit back Monday in a joint statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that said certain district and magistrate judges in Halligan’s district were pursing an “unconscionable campaign of bias and hostility” against her and her line prosecutors.

“Lindsey and our attorneys are simply doing their jobs: advocating for the Department of Justice’s positions while following guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel,” the No. 1 and 2 DOJ officials said. “They do not deserve to have their reputations questioned in court for ethically advocating on behalf of their client.”

On Tuesday, a judge suggested at a hearing that Halligan should take a page out of Habba’s book and relinquish her role. Pointing out her resignation, Judge Leonie Brinkeman said, “that’s the proper position, in my view,” according to the Times.

The Justice Department has not appealed Halligan’s dismissal, keeping her in the role, nonetheless. It’s not clear how far DOJ will take any of the U.S. attorney disqualifications, after dismissing Habba’s case before it could reach the Supreme Court.

But the calculus could involve efforts to reindict Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), the two Trump foes Halligan was hand-picked to pursue charges against in the first place.

The bigger problem, identified by Trump, is the excessive stalling of Senate confirmation for his nominees, bumping their tenure out of the interim window where many initially served lawfully before the legality of their leadership came into question upon its expiration.

On Monday, the president blamed the Senate’s long-standing blue slip tradition that lets lets home-state senators veto presidential nominees to district courts and U.S. attorney offices.

Trump vowed in August that he’d sue over the practice, but such a lawsuit against what the president has called a “gentleman’s agreement” would face long odds and never came to fruition.

Boasberg v. Noem

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has his eye on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as the judge weighs potential criminal contempt referrals.

Boasberg oversees one of the highest-profile challenges to Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to a Salvadoran megaprison.

Nearly nine months after Trump first invoked the law to quickly launch deportation flights, the case has returned to Boasberg’s court, and he’s resuming his contempt inquiry.

Noem has taken center stage upon the Justice Department disclosing for the first time that she made the final decision not to turn around planes as Boasberg handed down an oral and subsequent written order to do so on the night of March 15.

“I made the decision to continue the transfer of custody of the Alien Enemies Act detainees,” Noem, under penalty of perjury, reaffirmed in a declaration submitted Friday.

The Trump administration maintains it didn’t violate Boasberg’s directive because the flights were already out of U.S. airspace by that time.

Months ago, Boasberg disagreed, but he has yet to identify any specific officials responsible. He’s now weighing whether to refer any of them for criminal prosecution.

As the Obama-appointed judge mulls next steps, the government’s latest court filings provide the clearest picture yet of how Noem came to her decision.

Blanche and Emil Bove, the then-principal associate deputy attorney general whom Trump later tapped for a federal appeals judgeship, in sworn declarations told Boasberg they had analyzed the judge’s statements that March night.

The duo said they advised the Department of Homeland Security’s acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara. Mazzara, in turn, advised Noem, he confirmed in a sworn declaration of his own.

None of the officials disclosed what the advice was, calling it privileged material.

What’s next? Boasberg wants to hear from witnesses.

The judge asked that Erez Reuveni appear on Monday. Reuveni worked in the Justice Department this spring and has become a whistleblower, accusing top officials of ignoring court orders.

Reuveni has said Bove suggested government attorneys may need to tell the courts “f‑‑‑ you” and defy any order blocking Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. Bove denies Reuveni’s account.

Reuveni now works at Democracy Forward, a left-leaning legal organization that prolifically challenges the Trump administration in court.

After Reuveni testifies, Boasberg ordered the government to produce Drew Ensign, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation, for Tuesday.

Boasberg has said he’s obligated to consider three factors to determine if an official should be referred for criminal contempt: (1) his order was “clear and reasonably specific”; (2) “the defendant violated the order”; and (3) “the violation was willful.”

Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are stepping up their scrutiny of the judge.

Six GOP senators — Eric Schmitt (Mo.), Mike Lee (Utah), Tommy Tuberville (Ala.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) — sent a letter last month to the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit urging him to suspend Boasberg.

It comes as some in the party hope to impeach the judge. Boasberg has also drawn Republicans’ ire for signing orders barring phone providers from telling lawmakers that Special Counsel Jack Smith was searching their records and comments Boasberg reportedly made at a closed-door meeting of federal judges.

Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee was set to hold a hearing on “rogue judges” and impeachment. It was postponed.

Chicago use-of-force case fizzling

The class-action lawsuit that sparked an expansive order restricting immigration agents’ use of force in the Chicago area is fizzling out.

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has shifted his focus from Chicago to Charlotte. It left the plaintiffs declaring victory and a push to drop their lawsuit that garnered national attention.

Not so fast, however.

“This is transparent procedural gamesmanship,” the Justice Department pushed back in court filings Thursday. “To be sure, if Plaintiffs want to stop litigating and this Court grants their motion for dismissal with prejudice, that is beyond Defendants’ control.”

“But this gambit should be seen for what it is.”

The judge is expected to grant the dismissal “with prejudice,” meaning it would prevent them from bringing substantially similar claims in the future.

The Justice Department wants that to be air-tight, insisting journalists, protesters and clergy members can’t file lawsuits claiming new constitutional violations by immigration agents.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee who oversees the case, hasn’t yet granted the dismissal request after holding a hearing last week. Ellis reportedly wants to give any class members an opportunity to object before ruling.

Already, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times have told Ellis that before ruling, she should first ensure the government produces various documents to the press and public related to the case.

Some have already been turned over, but others haven’t as the government works to make redactions.

“A dismissal should not derail the right of the public and the press to access the materials that the parties submitted to the Court and that the Court has already determined are a part of the public record in this case,” the outlets wrote in court filings Thursday.

SIDEBAR

5 top docket updates

Habba out: Alina Habba, the former personal lawyer to Trump, stepped down from her contested position atop the federal prosecuting office in New Jersey after federal courts ruled she was unlawfully appointed. She said she’ll take on a new DOJ role as a senior advisor to Attorney General Pam Bondi for U.S. Attorneys.

SCOTUS OKs Texas map: The Supreme Court in an emergency ruling enabled Texas to use its congressional map for the midterms that adds up to five GOP pickups and ignited a mid-decade restricting war. The court’s liberal justices publicly dissented.

Jan. 6 pipe bomb arrest: Brian Cole Jr., the Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican national committee offices on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, was arrested and made his first court appearance, unraveling one of the longest lasting mysteries from those days.

James no bill: The Justice Department failed to secure a new indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) after its initial case against her was dismissed, a blunder for prosecutors who have trained their sights on the Trump adversary.

New SCOTUS emergency case: The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute involving immigration judges’ free speech rights. The dispute raises significant implications for lawsuits filed by federal employees. It’s the administration’s 32nd emergency appeal since taking office.

In other news

Privileged behavior: Trump personally asserted executive privilege to keep thousands of documents out of discovery in a long-lasting civil case stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. See his unmistakable signature yourself in the court filings here.

Stay a while: In an exclusive interview with Politico, Trump said he hopes Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas stay on the bench, a response to calls for the 70-somethings to retire so the president could appoint new conservative justices.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Birthright citizenship

Last week, we previewed six petitions to keep an eye on. The court took up four of them.

The headliner is Trump v. Barbara, the battle over the constitutionality of Trump’s birthright citizenship restrictions (for real, this time).

The justices also agreed to hear Abouammo v. United States, an appeal brought by a former Twitter manager accused or providing information to an associate of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince is Mohammed bin Salman about Saudi dissidents. Defendant Ahmad Abouammo argues he was convicted in the wrong venue.

The court also took up T.M. v. University of Maryland Medical System, which implicates the scope of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. The doctrine prohibits federal district judges from considering cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by a final state court decision.

And finally, the court agreed to hear Jules v. Andre Balazs Properties. The dispute stems from discrimination claims a security guard brought against Chateau Marmont, a historic Hollywood hotel known for its celebrity guests. At issue before the high court is a thorny jurisdiction issue.

OUT: Book ban challenge

The court declined to hear Little v. Llano County, Texas, a challenge to the county public library removing 17 books from its shelves.

A district judge found the removals were motivated by a desire to censor certain viewpoints. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed those claims, saying that public library patrons had no right to challenge the removals under the First Amendment.

The patrons had asked the high court to take up their appeal.

They were represented by Elizabeth Prelogar, former President Biden’s solicitor general. It was one of her first petitions she brought to the Supreme Court since returning to private practice at the law firm Cooley.

MAYBE: Vaccine mandates

The Supreme Court asked the Trump administration to weigh in on whether to take up three pending petitions.

The first, Does 1-2 v. Hochul, involves a challenge to New York’s COVID-era vaccine mandate for health care workers. They are raising claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The second, Crowther v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, is a major dispute over Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded schools. The petition, brought by Georgia Tech’s former women’s basketball coach and another employee, concerns if school employees have the right to bring Title IX lawsuits.

And the third, Hoffman v. WBI Energy Transmission, concerns eminent domain. The Natural Gas Act delegates that constitutional authority to condemn property to private companies so they can construct federally funded pipelines. The case involves how “just compensation” to property owners should be calculated in those cases.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

Gun rights: Last week, we highlighted the dozens of challenges to the federal crime for felons possessing firearms. No action yet, but we hope you held your beer, because the court has relisted 21 additional Second Amendment petitions. Some concern that same felon-in-possession law. Others challenge an AR-15 ban in Cook County, Ill., and high-capacity magazine bans in California and Washington state.

Rodney Reed: Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed is back at the Supreme Court in his fight for DNA testing to provide he’s innocent in a 1996 murder. Three years ago, the court ruled 6-3 in his favor that he hadn’t waited too long to seek the testing. Now, the fight concerns whether the murder weapon Reed wants tested was potentially contaminated, and whether the refusal to test it violates his due process rights. The case is Reed v. Goertz.

Fourth Amendment (pinging Luigi Mangione followers): A criminal defendant in Iowa is asking the justices to provide a national answer on whether police violate the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches when they search someone’s bag without a warrant while arresting them, if the bag was inaccessible to the person when searched. This is the issue at the center of Luigi Mangione’s ongoing pre-trial hearing in New York. The case is Scullark v. Iowa.

Vermont statehouse removal: Vermont State Police Sergeant Jacob Zorn is asking the justices to toss an excessive force lawsuit brought by Shela Linton, who suffered permanent wrist damage after being forcibly from the state House chamber floor in 2015. Linton was conducting a sit-in supporting universal health care. An appeals court ruled a judge wrongly ruled the sergeant could claim qualified immunity without going to trial. The case is Zorn v. Linton.

ON THE DOCKET

Don’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:

Today:

The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments regarding how multiple IQ scores factor into whether someone is eligible for the death penalty. The case is Hamm v. Smith.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal in a challenge to the president’s executive order cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) brought by 11 intelligence community members on DEI-related assignments.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing in two unions’ challenge to Trump’s Labor Day executive order exempting six agencies from the coverage of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.

Thursday:

A federal judge in New York is set to hold a status conference in the sex trafficking case against former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries and two others.

Friday:

There are no notable hearings.

Monday:

The Supreme Court will announce orders.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of a challenge to Trump’s efforts to gut collective bargaining for federal workers, brought by federal employee organizations and unions.

A federal judge in Massachusetts is set to consider university associations’ bid for remedies against the Trump administration after the judge found Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists was unlawful.

A trial is set to begin in Alaska against a man accused of sending graphic threats to kill Supreme Court justices and their family members.

A federal judge in California is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing over the state’s congressional map, adopted through a ballot proposition, Proposition 50, drawn to benefit Democrats.

Tuesday:

A federal judge in Florida is set to oversee a settlement conference in a lawsuit brought by a group of migrants detained at Alligator Alcatraz and four immigration groups seeking to guarantee attorney access and other steps.

A federal judge in Massachusetts is set to oversee a hearing regarding the Trump administration’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to mandate women’s registration for the Selective Service draft.

Another Massachusetts federal judge is set to hold a hearing with countering arguments for summary judgment and dismissal in a challenge to the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians and Venezuelans.

And a third federal judge in Massachusetts is set to oversee a summary judgment hearing in a challenge to DHS’s policy seeking to deport noncitizens to a third country without giving them notice or opportunity to contest their fear of persecution there.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Following a strike on an alleged drug vessel in October, Pentagon lawyers suggested that the two survivors could be placed into a notorious prison in El Salvador, according to three officials. Later that month, Pentagon officials decided that boat strike survivors would be sent back to their home countries or to a third country, three other officials said. During a meeting with the State Department, officials made it clear that they did not want survivors to end up in the U.S. judicial system, where court cases could force the administration to show evidence justifying the strikes. Damien Cave, Edward Wong, and Maria Abi-Habib report for the New York Times.

The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mike Rogers (R-AL), said yesterday that he does not need to further investigate the Sept. 2 strike that killed two survivors. “It’s done,” Rogers told reporters. “I’ve got all the answers I needed.” A spokesperson for Rogers confirmed the congressman’s plans, though his timeline for winding things down was not clear. Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO; Noah Robertson, Dan Lamothe, and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to commit to releasing the video of the Sept. 2 strikes in the Caribbean,” Democratic lawmakers said yesterday after a classified briefing to the “Gang of Eight.” The closed-door discussion, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratclifee, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine mostly centered on the 22 known boat strikes, according to a U.S. official. “I asked them what their strategy is, and what they were doing, and again, did not get satisfying answers at all,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) said after the briefing. Megan Mineiro and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times; Patricia Zengerle, Bipasha Dey, and Ghaneshwar Rajan report for Reuters.

Adm. Alvin Holsey, the outgoing head of U.S. Southern Command, briefed top lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees yesterday. “We got some clarity on the chain of command and who made decisions at what point, but on the legality of it we didn’t get a lot of clarity,” said Representative Adam Smith (D-WA). Megan Mineiro and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times.

The U.S. military yesterday flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appears to be the closest U.S. warplanes have come to Venezuelan airspace since the strikes began in September, according to a public flight tracking website. A U.S. defense official said the jets conducted a “routine training flight” in the area. Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

“I will say frankly that I am ready for elections,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters yesterday, adding that elections could be held in the next 60 to 90 days if the United States and Europe provided Kyiv with security guarantees. Zelenskyy also said yesterday that Ukraine was still working on revising a peace plan, which would probably be sent to the United States on Wednesday. Claire Moss reports for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

A UNICEF spokesperson yesterday called for the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza to be opened to help increase the flow of humanitarian trucks which would bring down the number of children and adults with malnutrition, adding that not enough aid is currently entering Gaza. The spokesperson said that 8,300 pregnant and breastfeeding women in October alone were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition, adding “this pattern is a grave warning and it will likely result in low birthweight babies being born in the Gaza Strip for months to come…This is not over.” UN News reports.

Husam Badran, a member of Hamas’ political wing, yesterday called for the “full implementation of all the terms of the first phase” of the peace plan before moving forward, including an end to the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes in the areas under Israeli-control. Megan Janetsky and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

The anti-Hamas group, Popular Forces, operating from Israeli-held areas of Gaza will continue to fight Hamas despite the killing of a prominent commander, Yasser Abu Shabab, last week, according to Ghassan Duhine, a deputy in the group. Three Egyptian sources said that such anti-Hamas groups had increased their activities since the ceasefire, and estimated they now had 1,000 fighters, adding 400 since the truce. A diplomat said the groups lacked any popular constituency, but added that their emergence raised concerns for stability in Gaza. Aidan Lewis reports for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The United States yesterday imposed sanctions on four individuals and four firms for their alleged involvement in a transnational network that recruits former Colombian military members who train soldiers for the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary. Under-Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said the RSF was supported by Colombian fighters when it captured El Fasher in October. Fatima Hussein reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has continued for a third day, showing no signs of slowing, as hundreds of thousands of people are displaced. About 400,000 people have been evacuated from across seven provinces in Thailand and around 700 schools closed, according to a spokesperson for the Thai military. The Cambodian defense ministry said that Cambodia has evacuated more than 127,000 villagers and closed hundreds of schools. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media that the two nations should “cease hostilities immediately,” adding that they must follow de-escalatory measures outlined in the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords in October. Jerry Harmer and Jintamas Saksornchai report for AP News; Kelly Ng reports for BBC News.

Russian and Chinese bombers yesterday conducted a joint, eight-hour patrol near Japan and South Korea, the Japanese defense ministry said. “The repeated joint flights of bombers by both countries signify an expansion and intensification of activities around our country, while clearly intending to demonstrate force against our nation, posing a serious concern for our national security,” Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said on social media. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said that the patrol was a normal part of regular cooperation between the Russian and Chinese militaries. Jason Douglas reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Infighting within Haiti’s Viv Ansanm gang coalition has killed at least 49 people in Port-au-Prince since Monday, according to a local human rights group. Danica Coto reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Microsoft yesterday announced that it would invest $17.5 billion in India for AI development, building on a $3 billion commitment announced earlier this year. The four-year spending plan starts in 2026 and would give Microsoft the largest cloud-computing presence in India. Aditya Soni, Deborah Mary Sophia, Nishit NAvin report for Reuters.

The Defense Department yesterday announced that it will deploy Google’s Gemini AI through the new GenAI.mil platform so all Pentagon employees can use it on their work computers. “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled A-I,” Hegseth said. Google Cloud said in a press release that employees can use Gemini for Government unclassified work, adding that none of the Defense Department’s data will be used to train Google’s public models. Sam Sabin and Colin Demarest report for Axios.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Moscow is waiting for a formal answer from Washington on Russia President Vladimir Putin’s proposal to extend NewSTART, the last remaining Russian-U.S. arms control treaty, which expires on Feb. 5, Russian Secretary of the Security Council Sergei Shoigu said yesterday. NewSTART caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both nations can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. Guy Faulconbridge and Lucy Papachristou report for Reuters.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it plans to ask travelers eligible for the visa waiver program for a long list of personal data, including social media, email addresses from the last decade, and the names, birth dates, places of residence and birthplaces of parents, spouses, siblings and children, according to a document filed yesterday in the Federal Register. Christine Chung reports for the New York Times.

Gov. JB. Pritzker (D-IL) yesterday signed into law several measures set to increase immigration protections in Illinois, including a ban on immigration arrests at state court houses or within 1,000 feet of those facilities, and restrictions on what information Illinois hospitals, childcare centers, and colleges can share with immigration authorities. María Luisa Paúl reports for the Washington Post.

Federal immigration agents yesterday used pepper spray to force their way through a crowd in Minneapolis to reach their vehicles following an identification sweep tied to the Trump administration’s crackdown on Somali immigrants, according to City Council Members Jamal Osman and an AP News videographer. Mark Vancleave and Steve Karnowski report for AP News.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday suggested that Lindsey Halligan should resign as U.S. attorney after a ruling declared her appointment unlawful, pointing toward Alina Habba’s resignation on Monday. The judge also asked whether there was any legal guidance issued by the Justice Department to explain why Halligan is still in the job. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has advised internally that Halligan could stay because the judge’s decision declaring her appointment invalid did not require a specific measure to be taken, according to sources. Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) removed language from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have restored a State Department office tasked with relocating Afghan refugees, a senior Senate Democrat and another source said yesterday. The sources said that language reestablishing the office was included in the compromise NDAA as recently as Friday, and that Johnson and Republican leadership had scrapped it over the weekend. Eric Bazail-Eimil reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge yesterday granted the Justice Department’s motion to release grand jury material and other nonpublic evidence from the criminal case of Ghislaine Maxwell. James Hill reports for ABC News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought signalled over the weekend that the White House may again use a reconciliation bill to increase defense spending next year. This approach has sparked criticism from Democrats and Republican lawmakers, who warn it sets a dangerous precedent and erodes one of the last areas of bipartisan consensus on the Hill. “I would prefer to use the regular appropriations process,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-MS) said. The strategy of combining a reconciliation package with the base defense budget could potentially push defense spending above $1 trillion. Anthony Adragna and Briana Reilly report for Punch Bowl News

The Trump administration has appointed Gregg Phillips, who has no official experience managing emergencies and has repeatedly claimed that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election, as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office for Response and Recovery. Brianna Sacks reports for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights yesterday filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, State, and Defense seeking disclosure of records related to the use of military force against civilian boats the government alleges were carrying drugs. Mariana Alfaro and Amy B Wang report for the Washington Post.

In a letter sent to state Senate leaders on Dec. 9, 2025, the Reporters Committee expressed strong support for House Bill 4045, which would make it harder for powerful parties to intimidate or punish speech through strategic lawsuits against public participation, known as SLAPPs. The legislation, which largely mirrors the Uniform Public Expression Protection Act, would help courts weed out meritless lawsuits before defendants incur significant legal fees.

Michigan is currently one of only 12 states that does not have an anti-SLAPP statute, making this proposed measure necessary to fill the gaps left by the state’s general law prohibiting frivolous lawsuits.

Those who interfered or helped fugitive slaves escape were fined $500. When enslaved people escaped, plantation owners relied on state and local government officials for enforcement.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 took it a step further. While it also allowed runaway slaves to be grabbed off the street, it made the federal government responsible for enforcing the law, and imposed harsh penalties ($1,000 fines and up to six-months imprisonment) on federal marshals who refused to help.

I am in no way equating the brutal institution of slavery with violations of immigration laws.

According to the laws of the United States, it was illegal for the enslaved to escape slavery and it is illegal now to enter this country without complying with the immigration laws.

But on our streets, you’re seeing law enforcement use tactics that were also prominently used in 1793 and 1850.

We pride ourselves to the world that we are a country based on the Rule of Law. The Rule of Law safeguards fundamental human rights, protects against the arbitrary exercise of power, and applies laws equally and fairly to everyone, regardless of who they are.

I was a New Orleans police officer. All professionally trained police officers in this country worth their salt know that the enforcement tactics used are unprofessional and unsafe. If these same enforcement tactics were used by any police officer, it would be illegal in a court of law.

I am not advocating that we should not enforce our immigration laws.

Ministers from 27 EU member nations are meeting in Brussels to discuss countering migrant smuggling, with a keynote speech by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In Strasbourg, France, representatives from the Council of Europe — 46 countries from Iceland to Azerbaijan — are expected to debate making deporting migrants easier for signatories to key treaties.

Denmark was part of a nine-nation attempt last year to curtail the power of the European Court of Human Rights, the independent legal arm of the Council of Europe. Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland argued that the court's interpretation of rights obligations prevented them from expelling migrants who commit crimes. That effort ultimately failed, but support for its basic tenets has since grown.

The European Court of Human Rights handles complaints against the Council of Europe, under the European Convention on Human Rights, including many cases involving migrants and asylum-seekers. The intergovernmental organization is not an EU institution and was set up in the wake of the World War II to promote peace and democracy.

Centrist and left-wing parties across Europe are coalescing around the idea of tougher migration policies as a way to blunt the momentum of far-right politicians exploiting discontent over immigration.

The prime ministers of Denmark and the U.K. published an op-ed in the Guardian newspaper on Tuesday calling for tightening migration controls to deny entry to those seeking better economic opportunities as opposed to fleeing conflict.

“For decades, citizens in our countries have demanded action. So we are acting — not to exploit these issues and stoke grievances as some do, but to find real solutions,” wrote Mette Frederiksen and Keir Starmer. “The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem.”

Illegal border crossings into the EU were down 22% from January to October this year, according to Frontex, the EU’s border and coast guard agency. The agency recorded 152,000 unauthorized border crossings in the first 10 months of the year.

Most migration to Europe happens legally, by air, with some immigrants overstaying tourist visas.

The EU has spent billions of euros (dollars) to deter irregular migration, paying countries in Africa and the Middle East to intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean of the Atlantic. At the same time, European nations facing labor shortages and an aging population are in desperate need of more workers and have been investing in programs to attract and train foreign workers.

The secretary-general of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, said ahead of the Strasbourg meeting that the European Convention on Human Rights was “the final safeguard of individual rights and freedoms across our continent.”

“The convention’s future and Europe’s direction are inseparable,” he said.

They also specified that the text should also take into account “governments’ fundamental responsibility to ensure national vital interests such as security and public safety”.

The declaration is expected to be adopted at the next formal session of the Committee of Ministers in the Moldovan capital Chisinau in May 2026.

DHS called him a “predator” and said the government would not grant green cards to “child abusers.”

When KUTV contacted local ICE public information officers, they could not confirm the allegations. A search of Utah’s state court system also found no such criminal history — only a citation for texting and driving in 2024.

Celis’s attorney, Adam Crayk, said the DHS post is false and defamatory and plans to sue the department for libel. He said the accusations stem from a sealed juvenile case involving Celis when he was around 16 years old.

According to Crayk, the situation involved two teenagers in a relationship and did not include the offenses DHS publicly claimed.

“They were boyfriend and girlfriend, there was literally nothing related to sodomy in anything that happened at the juvenile adjudication,” he said. “We had two kids, a girl who could not consent, and candidly, a young man who, at the time, could not consent either. A family that was upset about the relationship and a record that was subsequently sealed.”

Utah law requires all juvenile court records to be sealed, so KUTV cannot independently confirm the details, though Crayk maintains the juvenile filings did not include sodomy.

Utah family shocked after ICE arrests husband during final green card interview

Attorney answers questions about man arrested by ICE at immigration review

The DHS post came just a week after Celis was taken into custody during what was supposed to be his final green card interview in West Valley City. Crayk said Celis has no adult criminal record and should have left that appointment with an approved green card.

Celis, who reportedly came to the United States from Mexico at age 10, overstayed a visa that expired six months later in 2008. His wife, Lexie Celis, a U.S. citizen, said the arrest has torn their family apart.

“For all the people who think that they’re just getting criminals, I am an example of them tearing our family apart,” she said. “I just feel betrayed. I feel no U.S. citizen should have to go through this.”

The couple has been married for four years and has a young child, a U.S. citizen. DHS documents show Celis’ father is a U.S. citizen, and his mother is a Mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident with a green card.

ICE issued its own statement on Tuesday saying Celis “is an illegal alien from Mexico” who overstayed a 2007 visa and was arrested for that violation.

Department of Homeland Security documents state Celis will remain in custody pending removal proceedings and is expected to appear before an immigration judge on Jan. 14, 2026, at 8 a.m. in Las Vegas.

Celis’ attorneys also provided KUTV with the DHS Notice to Appear documents filed this week. They show Celis was taken into custody on Dec. 2 at noon in Salt Lake City. The documents state:

He entered the U.S. in July 2007 as a B-2 tourist and remained beyond the January 2008 expiration date.

He applied for a marriage-based green card in November 2024.

Criminal-history checks were negative.

NCIC records showed no wants or warrants.

The “basis for ICE charges” section was left blank.

Crayk said those federal records directly contradict DHS’s public claims of criminal history and show the agency misrepresented sealed juvenile allegations to portray Celis as a child predator.

“We were appalled and disheartened to see our own government engage in a smear campaign with information that is sealed and only available to the government through their national security powers,” he said. “Even more disheartening is the fact that the government labeled Jair Celis with a title that was never proven, never established, and did not even enter into any of the record in juvenile court.”

“To be clear, under Utah and U.S. immigration law, juvenile adjudications are not criminal convictions and do not constitute criminal history,” he said.

Crayk added that immigration court records list Celis’ criminal history as “none” and said ICE officers handled the case appropriately, while DHS leadership did not.

“You would think that someone tweeting from a DHS leadership position would verify before publishing inaccurate and salacious garbage to the world,” Crayk said. “All this will do is create a wider divide and more polarizing behavior between those that support the administration and those that do not.”

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees.
Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.","The Trump administration is transforming the agency known for processing green cards and citizenship requests into one of its strongest anti-immigration policing arms.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is one of the three branches of the Homeland Security Department that deals with migration.

Traditionally, its more than 20,000 employees have focused on the various ways people can lawfully immigrate and stay in the U.S. — be that applying for asylum, a green card, citizenship, work visa, or another legal pathway.

Since January, administration officials have taken an axe to that traditional mission by encouraging early retirements, shuttering collective bargaining agreements and drastically cutting back on programs that facilitate legal migration. New job postings lean into the rhetoric of hiring ""homeland defenders"" and tackling fraud.

During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that ""at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.""

The efforts come as President Trump seeks to curb illegal immigration but also reduce legal ways to get to the U.S. and stay here, especially for certain nationalities.

It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.

With the recent changes, at least 1,300 people took the ""Fork in the Road"" resignation offer for federal employees, while others have left on their own. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees were not allowed to take the offer.)

And it's catching immigrants and their families, lawyers and advocates off guard.

""'Am I going to get arrested?' … That's a question, regardless of their past,"" said Eric Welsh, an immigration attorney in California who helps his clients apply for various USCIS programs.

""There really is a lot more fear and there is a lot more concern about, should we do it at all?,"" Welsh said, about people applying for legal status.

Rapid changes after deadly shooting

The changes have been rapid. In recent weeks, the White House said it would re-review all approved refugee claims under the Biden administration.

After an Afghan national was charged for shooting two National Guard members in late November, the administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, and ordered retroactive reviews of already-approved applications.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,"" Trump wrote on social media after the shooting. ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.

""USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,"" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.

""Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.""

Recent policies come after a swath of other changes this year. Policy memos have emphasized that the priority for refugees is admitting those who can easily assimilate into the country, with the target demographic being white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The White House also capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest since the modern refugee program started in the 1980s.

The agency has unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.

Reports of arrests and detention following routine USCIS interviews and appointments have increased fear among immigrants.

""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. ""That's a pretty different stance towards immigration than we've seen over recent decades.""

In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.

""Some people, if they have a green card, might just wait to naturalize and see if they can wait for a new administration,"" Gelatt said.

USCIS leans into enforcement and policing tactics

The new administration has prioritized the agency's law enforcement work.

For example, USCIS has promoted a new role: ""homeland defenders.""

It is unclear exactly what these positions are responsible for. USCIS said they will be ""interviewing aliens, reviewing applications, and identifying criminal or ineligible aliens.""

The posting also specifies this position is expected to provide direct support to CBP and ICE, two agencies leading the effort to arrest, detain and deport immigrants.

The roles also seem to cater to those with backgrounds in traditional law enforcement, contrary to a background in immigration law and administrative government work that is more typical for USCIS.

USCIS said it received some 35,000 applications for the role of ""homeland defender"" and has made ""hundreds"" of job offers, including to former law enforcement officials and veterans, according to a November USCIS press release.

""USCIS is cutting bureaucratic red tape to hire fiercely dedicated, America-first patriots to serve on the frontlines and hold the line against terrorists, criminal aliens, and bad actors intent on infiltrating our nation,"" the release stated.

It also created USCIS special agents, who have law enforcement authority to carry firearms, and investigate, arrest and prosecute immigration cases. In the past, much of this would be the work of ICE or CBP, according to the release announcing the new workforce.

""Certainly the immigration enforcement side of things that are happening has sent a message that anybody who isn't a citizen in the United States could be arrested and put into ICE detention and potentially deported,"" Gelatt said. ""That has a real chilling effect on people's willingness to interact with the government generally, and with USCIS as well.""

USCIS workers defend past enforcement

The changes are having an impact inside the agency, as workers feel out of the loop about the direction and pace of changes.

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees. He says morale is some of the lowest he's seen in his tenure, thanks to the termination of the union contract, a haphazard back-to-office mandate that has employees working in makeshift desks, and a lack of communication from agency leadership.

""There are questions about what will be our mission, what will be our focus? And to that extent, we are alarmed by rhetoric,"" Knowles said. He said the agency has always enforced the nation's immigration laws when it processes applications.

One USCIS refugee officer who recently departed the agency after nearly a decade said the speed of the changes ""overwhelmed"" employees, and recent changes were the last straw. The person spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retaliation from the agency they hope to return to.

USCIS staffers say they have always worked hard to ensure people don't get benefits they do not qualify for, and also look for people who may be breaking the law.

So employees were upset by the administration's implication that they hadn't been doing their jobs properly for the last five years, after the White House announced all refugees admitted under in the Biden era must be reinterviewed.

""It's going to cause a lot of confusion. It's going to cause a lot of chaos. It's going to cost a lot of money,"" the employee said. ""It seems impossible.""

USCIS said it has paused the approvals while it ""works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.

Not ""an adversarial office""

Beyond policy and rhetoric changes, there's been subtler signs of transformation.

Signs inside USCIS offices urge people to leave the country, mirroring the tone of a detention center, rather than that of an immigration office, according to Welsh and other lawyers.

""USCIS is not designed to be an adversarial office,"" he said. ""They're not the enforcers. They're not looking to reduce.""

Now, he said, his clients are concerned with needing to have proof of a good moral character by providing church attendance or charitable donation history, for example.

""It's now certainly not the kind of friendly atmosphere that we used to experience with the agency,"" Welsh said.

Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.

""We have borders and we have benefits. So for people who deserve them or people who have earned them for various reasons, we provide them,"" Welsh said. ""If we just go into a pure enforcement mindset, then there's no happy place to be.""

The president told the crowd gathered at a casino and resort in Mount Pocono that inflation was no longer a problem and that Democrats had used the term ""affordability"" as a ""hoax"" to hurt his reputation. But his remarks weaved wildly to include grievances he first raised behind closed doors in his first term in 2018 — and later denied saying — asking why the U.S. doesn't have more immigrants from Scandinavia.

""Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?"" Trump said onstage. ""Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few?""

Trump said he objected to taking immigrants from ""hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries."" He added for emphasis that those places ""are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.""

Tuesday's gathering in the swing state — and in a competitive House district — was an official White House event, yet it seemed more like one of his signature campaign rallies that his chief of staff said he would hold regularly ahead of next year's midterms. But instead of being in an arena that could draw several thousand attendees, it was held in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, a small town of about 3,000 residents.

Voters starting to blame lasting inflation on Republicans

Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

He displayed a chart comparing price increases under his predecessor, Joe Biden, to prices under his own watch to argue his case. But the overall inflation rate has climbed since he announced broad tariffs in April and left many Americans worried about their grocery, utility and housing bills.

""I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,"" Trump said. ""They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.""

As the president spoke, his party's political vulnerabilities were further seen as Miami voters chose Eileen Higgins to be their first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. Higgins defeated the Trump-endorsed Republican Emilio Gonzalez.

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally showed he could still appeal to the base, but it was unable to settle questions of whether he could hold together his 2024 coalition. Monroe County flipped to Trump last year after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.

As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.

In Monroe County, people agree that prices are a problem

But what seems undeniable — even to Trump supporters in Monroe County — is that inflation seems to be here to stay.

Lou Heddy, a retired maintenance mechanic who voted for Trump last year, said he's noticed in the past month alone that his and his wife's grocery bills have risen from $175 to $200, and he's not sure Trump can bring food prices down.

""Once the prices get up for food, they don't ever come back down. That's just the way I feel. I don't know how the hell he would do it,"" said Heddy, 72.

But Suzanne Vena, a Democratic voter, blames Trump's tariffs for making life more expensive, as she struggles with rising bills for food, rent and electricity on a fixed income. She remembers Trump saying that he would stop inflation.

""That's what we were originally told,"" said Vena, 66. ""Did I believe it? That's another question. I did not.""

The area Trump visited could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.

Trump held his rally in a congressional district held by first-term Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.

Speaking to the crowd before Trump, Bresnahan said the administration was working to lower costs, but voters ""aren't asking for partisan arguments — they're asking for results.""

It's not clear if Trump can motivate voters in Monroe County to show up in next year's election if they're worried about inflation.

Nick Riley, 38, said he's cutting back on luxuries, like going out to eat, as he absorbs higher bills for food and electricity and is having a hard time finding a good deal on a used car. Riley voted for Trump in 2020, but he sat out the 2024 election and plans to do so again next year.

""We're all broke. It doesn't matter whether you support Republicans or support Democrats,"" Riley said. ""We're all broke, and we're all feeling it.""

Trump to start holding more rallies before midterm elections

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show ""The Mom View"" that Trump would be on the campaign trail next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.

Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.

""We're actually going to turn that on its head,"" Wiles said, ""and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.""

The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying a historic boom.

Asked on a Politico podcast how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into grade inflation by answering ""A-plus,"" only to then amend his answer to ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

Trump says economy is strong, but Americans should buy fewer dolls

The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

So far, the public has been skeptical about Trump's economic performance. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

But Trump indicated that his tariffs and other policies were helping industries such as the steel sector. He said those industries mattered for the country as he then specifically told Americans that they should buy fewer pencils and dolls from overseas.

""You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,"" he told the crowd. ""Two or three is nice.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6340x3566+0+330/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fed%2F0dd5b6fa4d92ad9d0aed00e75ef3%2Fap25344087106176.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 05:57:15.593621

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says it is unfair to say this Congress has relinquished its authority as an independent, coequal branch.
Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.
“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote.","The Republican-controlled House and Senate have not done much to stand in the way of President Donald Trump — even when his actions have encroached on terrain the Constitution reserved for them.

But there are signs that some Republican lawmakers are trying to reassert their independence.

When news broke last week that the Pentagon carried out a second strike on two individuals on a largely-destroyed alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, even some Republicans expressed alarm.

""Somebody made a horrible decision,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. told reporters in the Capitol. ""Somebody needs to be held accountable. This is our job. This is part of oversight. That's pretty straightforward.""

The strikes are not the only actions that have spurred a handful of Republicans to stake out a bit of daylight with the Trump Administration. Some have criticized Trump's tariffs, like Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.

""Our lobsterman, our blueberry growers, our potato farmers will pay the price,"" Collins said in October, before a vote to roll back tariffs on Canada.

Ahead of the upcoming expiration date for enhanced health care subsidies, which Trump has signaled indifference to renewing, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned last month of a ""massive crisis unless Congress acts.""

Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon has been one of the most consistent critics of Trump's approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion into Ukraine. Bacon consistently calls it a soft touch, particularly in contrast to Trump's approach to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The velvet glove, red carpet treatment for Putin and then the condescending, boorish behavior that the president and the vice president has done towards Zelenskyy – it's a contrast,"" Bacon told Nebraska Public Media earlier this year.

Senators have also pushed back on Trump's intermittent calls to end the filibuster. ""You'd have to be smoking wizard weed to vote for that,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters during the 43 day government shutdown that ended last month.

And Trump's reluctance to release the investigative files into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein spurred a break between the president and one of his closest allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

""He called me a traitor for standing with these women,"" she said.

Moments of GOP resistance or a growing trend?

After months of the White House steamrolling Congress on tariffs, appropriations and military intervention, even this careful pushback is a departure, says former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Az.).

Flake says the shift is accelerating with Trump's declining approval rating. The pushback also grew following Republicans' poor performance in off-year elections last month.

""There was a lot of fear about what he could do to you electorally,"" Flake said. ""That's diminishing.""

Flake, who did not run for reelection in 2018 in part because he refused to unconditionally back Trump, says some lawmakers are now more willing to say aloud what they long expressed behind closed doors.

""Obviously behind the scenes, it's a whole different ballgame,"" he said. ""This migration is happening and when Republicans get there, they'll get to a new-old place where they were on some of these threshold issues that have animated conservatives for decades.""

But this is not the first time observers have declared a new era, only for Trump to firm up his grip on Congressional Republicans, including the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.

""A lot of us have been wrong on how long this has endured,"" he said.

Most of the Republicans vocalizing their disagreements are retiring, represent competitive districts or are perennial centrists. And some of the splits with Trump have not been over traditional Republican values, but urging him to follow through on the populist platform he ran on.

Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Congress has made some recent attempts to push back on the White House, like resolutions rebuking the tariffs and boat strikes, but they have not been very successful or sufficient.

""I'd like to see more, and I believe that if we don't stand up for our powers under the Constitution, nobody else will,"" Murkowski told NPR in an interview.

Constitutional role of Congress

The framers gave the Congress the power to appropriate funds, to declare war and levy taxes, like tariffs.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says it is unfair to say this Congress has relinquished its authority as an independent, coequal branch.

""I don't know how much different this one is,"" Thune told NPR. ""A lot of times if I have differences with the administration, I don't litigate it in public. But we do have a responsibility as partners to try to get an agenda done for the American people that they voted for.""

Molly Reynolds, a Brookings Institution expert on Congress, says it's true this is not just a Trump-era phenomenon. Congress has been ceding power to the executive and judicial branches for decades.

""And in some cases, Congress has been a willing and eager participant in sacrificing its own power to the other branches,"" she said.

Reynolds said this did not start with Trump's willingness to act more unilaterally in his second term, but it did escalate the trend. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) recently told The Katie Miller Podcast that, ""We have this joke that I'm not really a Speaker of the House.""

Reynolds, who jokingly calls herself a partisan of the first branch, says it is no accident the legislative branch is established in Article 1 of the Constitution. She said the framers saw the legislative branch as the closest to the people. The separation of powers and checks and balances are foundational concepts of the American form of government.

Reynolds said there is precedent for Congress taking steps to reassert its power, like the Watergate-era reforms to reign in the power of the president.

""It was in a really different political moment than the one we're living in now,"" Reynolds said, noting that politics is more polarized today. ""Which is part of what makes it challenging to see the prospects for a similar burst of institutional patriotism.""

Raul Malo, the leader of the country band The Mavericks and one of the most recognizable voices in roots music, died Monday night, according to a representative of the band. The guitarist and singer had been battling cancer.

He was hospitalized last week, forcing him to miss tribute shows staged in his honor at the Ryman Auditorium over the weekend. He was 60 years old.

""No one embodied life and love, joy and passion, family, friends, music and adventure the way our beloved Raul did,"" read a statement released by his family.

Malo's group, The Mavericks, mourned the loss of their leader in a social post.

""Anyone with the pleasure of being in Raul's orbit knew that he was a force of human nature, with an infectious energy,"" the statement read. ""Over a career of more than three decades entertaining millions around the globe, his towering creative contributions and unrivaled, generational talent created the kind of multicultural American music reaching far beyond America itself.""

Over a career that lasted four decades, The Mavericks lived up to the band's name, challenging expectations and following a roadmap crafted by Malo's expansive musical upbringing as the son of Cuban immigrants in Miami.

""I grew up in a very musical household. There was all kinds of music around always,"" he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1995. ""We listened to everything from Hank Williams to Celia Cruz to Sam Cooke to Bobby Darin. It didn't matter.""

In 1992, Malo told NPR that his widespread influences weren't always understood or appreciated in his South Florida hometown, but he said that his struggle to fit in taught him to trust his instincts. Malo had become the guitarist and lead singer for The Mavericks in 1989, alongside co-founders Robert Reynolds and Paul Deakin, and his roaring, sentimental voice defined the band's sound and remained its constant as the group's catalog moved from slow, tender ballads to full-throttle rock songs. In 1995, the band released its biggest hit with ""All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,"" a swinging country song featuring an assist from Tex-Mex accordion legend Flaco Jimenez.

As the band grew in members and devoted listeners, The Mavericks continued to push the boundaries of American music, weaving a richly layered tapestry of textures and stories. With more than a dozen studio albums, The Mavericks collected praise and recognition from the Academy of Country Music, the Country Music Association and the Recording Academy. Although they took a hiatus for several years, Malo never stopped making music — and returned to his bandmates with renewed inspiration.

Following its 30th anniversary, the group released its first full-length Spanish album in 2020, aptly titled En Español. The record reimagined Latin standards and folklore-tinged popular tunes; it also made an implicit political statement about Latin music's contributions to American culture.

""In our own little way, if we could get somebody that perhaps is on the fence on issues and hears us singing in Spanish and perhaps reminds them of the beautiful cultures that make up what this country is trying to be and what it should be, so be it,"" Malo told NPR at the time. ""Yeah, I'm OK with that.""

The following year, the Americana Music Association recognized The Mavericks with the Trailblazer Award. In 2024, the band released its last studio album, Moon & Stars. The release coincided with news of Malo's cancer diagnosis, which he discussed openly with NPR's Ayesha Rascoe.

Before being hospitalized last week, Malo had been scheduled to perform with The Mavericks at a pair of tribute concerts held this past weekend at the legendary Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Over 30 artists, including Patty Griffin, Jim Lauderdale and Steve Earle, still gathered to pay tribute to Malo, with some of the proceeds of the night going to the cancer prevention organization Stand Up To Cancer.

According to his spokesperson, though Malo was too ill to attend, the concert was streamed to his hospital room Friday night.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has mostly blocked efforts to investigate misconduct within its ranks, according to the county inspector general, who announced his retirement Tuesday after 12 years on the job.

In an open letter, Max Huntsman cited examples of how the county has thwarted his efforts to watchdog the department, which in the past has been plagued with accusations that deputies use excessive force and lie on the job.

Huntsman said one example is former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s misuse of criminal enforcement powers to discredit critics, such as opening an investigation into former County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl.

Villanueva was sheriff from 2018 to 2022.

“My requests for investigation were rejected,” Huntsman’s letter reads. “Even after receiving an official subpoena, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to turn over records regarding the improper surveillance.”

He added: “Sometimes members of the public wonder if frightening new surveillance techniques will be used for improper purposes under the guise of criminal investigation. Sadly, the answer is yes.”

Before becoming inspector general in 2013, Huntsman, 60, was a deputy district attorney who specialized in public corruption. He told LAist on Tuesday that the inspector general job wasn’t something he wanted initially.

“I didn’t want to go work for politicians,” he said. “But the need to provide some kind of independent reporting and analysis was significant.”

The Sheriff’s Department issued a statement saying it valued the Office of the Inspector General and all county oversight bodies and that it wished Huntsman and his family well in his retirement.

The department said it “continues to make great strides in advancing the department in a transparent manner.”

LAist also reached out to the county CEO and county counsel for comment, but they declined.

After George Floyd

In the letter, Huntsman says the state of California has come a long way in strengthening the power of local law enforcement oversight bodies, in part because of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

After widespread protests — and lobbying by Huntsman — the state provided authority to inspectors general to enforce subpoenas requiring law enforcement agencies to hand over documents and authorized external investigation of police misconduct, including deputy gang conduct.

The Sheriff’s Department — backed by county lawyers — has resisted.

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote. “The county refuses to require the photographing of suspected gang tattoos in secretive groups that the undersheriff has identified as violating state law.”

“Just a few weeks ago, we requested some information regarding an investigation, and a pair of commanders refused to give it to us,” Huntsman said in an interview with LAist.

Origin of the office

The Inspector General’s Office was created by the county Board of Supervisors in 2013 in response to a scandal that included former Sheriff Lee Baca covering up the abuses of jail inmates.

Baca went to federal prison.

Since then, the office has issued dozens of reports with recommendations for improving living conditions inside jails that some have described as “filthy,” stopping abuses of juveniles inside juvenile halls and providing shower privacy for inmates as part of the requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.

“All of these abuses were reported by the Office of Inspector General and recommendations were ignored,” Huntsman wrote. Often, it took court orders to enact change.

“When we first blew the whistle on the torturous chaining of mentally ill prisoners to benches for 36 hours at a time, it was only a court order that ended the practice,” he wrote. “Time and time again, this pattern repeated itself.”

Huntsman wrote the county has permitted the Sheriff’s Department to block oversight and defunded the Office of Inspector General by removing a third of its staff.

“It's not surprising the county has driven out two successive chairs of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission,” he wrote.

“Government always claims to value transparency and accountability, but shooting the messenger is still the most common response to criticism,” Huntsman wrote.

Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work

Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.

“I’ve really enjoyed the work and I’m sad to have it end,” he said.

It’s a sentiment he echoed in his letter, adding that despite the setbacks and roadblocks, he was proud of the people with whom he shared the office.

“It has been my honor to work with a talented, brave and tireless group of public servants to ensure that the public knows what its government is doing,” he wrote.

He noted the inspector general’s reports are fact-checked by the office and public.

“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote. “What you do about it is up to you.,”

The Court of Appeal followed the consistent line of case law from the European Court of Human Rights in stating that in cases not concerning the core family, family life will only be established where there are additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties. This is well-established doctrine. The judgment is, however, significant as the earlier tribunal decisions in IA have played a critical role in influencing policy making in respect of immigration and human rights law. First, the tribunal decisions in IA were cited as indicative of the problems with Article 8 ECHR in legal advice that was published by the Conservative Party in relation to withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (the Wolfson Report). Second, it appears that the tribunal decisions in IA have shaped the Government’s proposal to legislate on the definition to be applied to family life (Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government’s asylum and returns policy). Given these developments it is essential that we examine what the Court of Appeal has determined and what this might mean for reform proposals.

The Background and Facts in IA

IA concerned a family from Gaza that was seeking reunification with a family member in the UK. The family consisted of a father, mother and their four children (who were aged 18, 17, 8 and 7). They applied to enter to join the younger brother of the father (their sponsor) who had been living and working in the UK since 2007 and is now a British citizen. They were not eligible to apply for entry under the Immigration Rules and thus they sought leave for entry outside the rules. Their application was rejected by the Home Office.

In considering whether the decision to reject the application was compatible with Article 8 ECHR, the First Tier Tribunal (FTT) held that although there was family life, such that Article 8 ECHR was applicable, the right could not outweigh the weight to be attached to the public interest. The FTT’s decision was later overturned by the Upper Tribunal (UT) on the basis that there were flaws in the way in which the FTT had assessed the significance to be accorded to family life when carrying out the balancing exercise. The UT thus remade the decision and allowed the applicants’ appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

It was the UT’s decision which then became the basis of a dispute in Parliament between Kemi Badenoch and the Prime Minister, during which the Prime Minister stated:

Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The Leader of the Opposition is right that it is the wrong decision. She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last Government, according to their legal framework. However, let me be clear: it should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the Government who make the policy. That is the principle. The Home Secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.

This led to a rebuke from the Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, who commented that she was ‘deeply troubled’ by the exchange between Kemi Badenoch and Keir Starmer as ‘both the question and the answer were unacceptable’. She went on to state that:

It is for government to visibly respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. Where parties, including the government, disagree with the judgment they should do so through the appellate process. Of course, MPs, just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law. I have taken this up as you would imagine and expect. I have written to the prime minister and lord chancellor.

In May 2025 the Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal to enable the Court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family.

While the appeal was pending, IA was cited in the Conservative Party’s Wolfson Report as part of the rationale for withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights. The Wolfson report stated (at [45]) that:

courts have given an extremely broad interpretation to the scope of the concept of “family life” to include relationships between siblings (including adult siblings); aunts or uncles and nephews or nieces; and grandparents and grandchildren.

It then cited IA in relation to its determination (at [45]) that:

The problematic effect of this in practice is that it provides first-tier judges with a broad margin within which “family life” can be found to exist, and a similarly broad margin of discretion for finding whether there has been an interference with such right and whether that interference can be justified (particularly given that the treatment of family members outside the UK can be taken into consideration when establishing whether there has been interference with the right to family life).

Following which it appears that IA, and the discourse surrounding it, fed into the Government’s proposal in November 2025 to set out in primary legislation the meaning of ‘family life’ for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. This is the political backdrop to the Court of Appeal judgment.

The Court of Appeal’s Judgment

Before the Court of Appeal, the SSHD argued, amongst other things, that there was no family life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR and that, even if the Convention right applied, the UT had erred in conducting the proportionality analysis. The SSHD succeeded on both those grounds. The Court of Appeal held that the proper test had not been applied by the tribunals and that applying the correct test there was no family life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. Though this would have been sufficient to allow the appeal, the Court of Appeal also agreed that even if there had been family life that the UT had made several errors in undertaking the balancing exercise. Essentially, too much weight had been given to the family’s interests, while insufficient weight had been accorded to the Government’s immigration policies. The Court of Appeal thus concluded that the UT should not have determined that the balance was struck in favour of entry.

Given the Government is proposing to introduce legislation on the definition of family life it is necessary to examine what the Court of Appeal said about the test for family life and how this aligns with the policy proposals.

Prior to clarifying the test for family life, the Court of Appeal conducted a thorough review of both the ECHR authorities and the domestic authorities. It concluded (at [60]) that:

the consistent jurisprudence of the ECtHR from S v UK [a 1984 Commission case] onwards has been that family life, within the autonomous meaning of article 8(1), is only to be found between adult siblings where “additional elements of dependence involving more than the normal emotional ties” are demonstrated.

The Court of Appeal was thus clear that the ECHR case law is not ambiguous on this point. In respect of the domestic case law, the Court of Appeal noted that while there may have been some twists and turns ‘the domestic courts have been consistently attempting to follow that ECtHR jurisprudence’ (at [61]). Consequently, ‘[e]ven if some of the domestic decisions may have provided divergent interpretations of the additional elements of the dependency test, none has suggested that they wanted to depart from the ECtHR jurisprudence’ (at [117]). The Court of Appeal therefore held that the correct test is that set out by the ECtHR in Kumari and the House of Lords in Beoku-Betts (at [116]), namely that in cases not concerning the core family, family life will only be established where there are ‘additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties’ ([at 119]). The Court of Appeal also confirmed that this is a fact-sensitive exercise (at [119]), that ‘financial dependency and dependency created by physical or mental disability both play a part in the evaluation’ but that it is not necessary to demonstrate ‘exclusive or complete dependency’ (at [120]). Applying this to the facts, the Court found that although there were close emotional ties that additional elements of dependency had not been demonstrated in this case.

How then does the dependency test identified and used by the Court of Appeal in IA compare with the Government plans for reform? The Government’s policy document states that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. As I observed in an earlier blog post some confusion arises from the fact that when the Home Secretary announced the policy in Parliament she stated that the Government will define ‘what, exactly, a family is – narrowing it down to parents and their children’, an approach which is narrower than that stated in the policy document. We can therefore identify three ways in which the Government might seek to legislate in respect of the definition of family life: (i) an additional elements of dependence test (i.e. following the wording of the case law) ; (ii) an exceptionally close link test (i.e. following the wording of the policy document) and (iii) a parents and children only test (i.e. following the statement of the Home Secretary).

(i) Additional Elements of Dependence Model

The first option is that the ‘additional elements of dependence’ test, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in IA, will be placed on a legislative footing. If future legislation simply replicates this test, then this would be no substantive change at all. It is, however, possible that any legislation might also purport to specify the criteria that the courts should apply in determining whether that dependency threshold is met. Those criteria might reflect those that have been identified in case law i.e. factors such as physical or mental dependency or financial dependency (as acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in IA). However, as the Court of Appeal observed in IA the dependency test is a fact-sensitive exercise, and the examples are non-exhaustive. Consequently, to remain compatible with Article 8 ECHR any legislation would need to both encompass what is in the existing case law while also not limiting the interpretation of dependency to those circumstances. In this regard it is worth observing that the Court of Appeal opined that ‘[i]n our judgment it is undesirable to lay down hard and fast rules as to how the additional elements of dependency test should be applied’ (at [125]).

(ii) Exceptionally Close Link Model

A second possibility is that legislation may replicate the language from the Government’s policy document i.e. introducing the concept of an ‘exceptionally close link’. As I have indicated previously, this could encompass a broader category of persons than those who currently fall within the dependency test and certainly introducing a new concept is likely to result in further ambiguity. This is evident if we consider the approaches to family life that were examined in IA. In IA the applicants argued that the ‘additional elements of dependency’ test is the ‘other side of the coin’ of a ‘real, committed or effective support’ test. The reference to ‘real, committed or effective support’ derives from dictum of Sedley LJ in Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 at [17], which had been used by the FTT in IA as a means of determining whether there was family life. The applicants thus argued that where there is ‘real, committed or effective support’, which the FTT had found that there was on these facts, that the dependency test is satisfied and Article 8 ECHR is applicable. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal on the basis that it is possible for there to be ‘real support’ without there being any ‘serious dependency’ (at [122]). Consequently, it observed that while:

it would be going too far to say that it is wrong to test whether there are additional elements of dependency by reference to real, committed or effective support provided’ the fact of ‘real, committed and effective support is not the test itself, because the level of real support, for example, may be minor or insignificant, whereas the word “dependency” denotes a significant relationship. This is not a semantic point. (at [123] emphasis in original)

Indeed, the fact that this was not a semantic point was borne out by IA itself as the Court of Appeal found that the FTT had applied the ‘real committed and effective support test’ and that this was a ‘less exacting standard’ (at [128]). It went on to observe:

The FTT had said expressly that the support test was a lower one than the dependence test and that there was no need to establish dependency. As we have explained, dependency is different from support. Establishing real, committed or effective support by itself may or may not be sufficient to establish additional elements of dependency for the existence of family life between adult siblings. (at [128]).

If we consider the Government’s approach in light of this then it appears that while an ‘exceptionally close link’ can be interpreted as requiring ‘additional elements of dependency’, it can also be read as encompassing cases where there is ‘real, committed and effective support’. Bringing forth legislation based on the concept of an ‘exceptionally close link’ may thus run the risk of reintroducing the very approach that was rejected by the Court of Appeal in IA. This is clearly not what the Government intends. Yet the adoption of different language in legislation from that which is currently used in the case law inevitably raises the spectre of further ambiguity, and consequently litigation, in respect of the meaning of family life. Again, this is clearly contrary to what the Government intends.

(iii) Parents and Children Only Model

As I have observed previously, a final possibility is that the legislation might reflect the approach stated by the Home Secretary ie. purporting to narrow ‘family life’ to ‘parents and their children’. If this approach is adopted, then the legislative provision would be incompatible with the Convention unless it is framed in a manner which enables the courts to read it compatibly using section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Introducing legislation that needs to be read compatibly using section 3 in order to ultimately arrive at a position that is already established in the case law is clearly convoluted and undesirable.

It will therefore be interesting to see what happens to the Government’s proposal in the light of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in IA. One possibility is that this aspect of the reform proposal will quietly fall away. If, however, legislation is brought forward then it will be necessary to examine whether it simply reflects the current law or whether there will be an attempt to redefine family life, a prospect that currently appears to be neither necessary nor desirable.

In its 2025–26 term, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship.

Oral arguments are expected to take place in the spring of 2026; the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

Although the executive order is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision, USCIS has issued guidance outlining how the order would be applied and enforced, if upheld.

In January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14160, which aimed to place restrictions on birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who were present in the country temporarily or without lawful status. The order would significantly abridge the long-standing constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for virtually all children born in the United States, as recognized in the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The order has not yet taken effect; multiple lawsuits produced preliminary injunctions in the lower courts. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published an implementation plan in July, outlining how the order would be applied.

Background on EO 14160

Section 1 of the executive order provides that a child born in the United States would no longer automatically be entitled to citizenship at birth in two situations: (1) when the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; or (2) when the mother’s presence was lawful but temporary (for example, under the Visa Waiver Program or on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

EO 14160 directs federal agencies to withhold citizenship documentation for such births, with the policy applying prospectively thirty days after the order, while clarifying that it does not affect, for example, children of lawful permanent residents. The order frames this position as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 8 U.S.C. § 1401’s “subject to the jurisdiction” language.

Legal Challenges to EO 14160

Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the executive order on birthright citizenship as unconstitutional under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment (the “Citizenship Clause”). Federal district judges in Washington State and Maryland entered injunctions blocking enforcement while the cases proceeded. In late June, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court curtailed federal district courts’ use of so-called nationwide (universal) injunctions, without resolving the order’s constitutionality, and litigation continued in the lower courts.

Following CASA, in Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction and an order granting provisional class certification, which prevented the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a certified class of babies born on or after February 20, 2025, who otherwise would be denied U.S. citizenship under the executive order. And in State of Washington v. Trump, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the executive order was “invalid because it contradict[ed] the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

In September 2025, the Trump administration’s lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court for review. The Trump administration’s certiorari petition requested that the Supreme Court review both Washington and Barbara; however, the Court’s order of December 5, 2025, indicates it will only take up the issue in Barbara. The case, expected to be argued in the spring with a definitive ruling to be issued by the end of June or early July 2026, will likely determine the future of birthright citizenship in the United States.

USCIS’s Implementation Plan for EO 14160

Although the EO is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Barbara, USCIS’s implementation plan, released on July 25, 2025, outlines how the order would be applied if it were ultimately upheld. The memo explains that “unlawfully present” refers to people in the United States without permission or those who have stayed longer than allowed, as defined in Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It also explains the difference between “unlawful status” and “unlawfully present.” For example, people paroled into the United States might not have a lawful immigration status, but they are not considered unlawfully present if they have permission to stay from the attorney general.

Since the term “lawful but temporary” presence isn’t clearly defined in the INA, USCIS has provided its own definition. This includes people who are in the United States legally for a limited time or under conditions that require them to reapply for continued stay. Examples include nonimmigrants, parolees, temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries, and deferred action recipients. USCIS also addresses the status of children born in the United States to parents with lawful but temporary status. These children do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents are not U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or U.S. nationals. To avoid negative immigration consequences for these children, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and USCIS propose allowing them to register and acquire the lawful status of at least one parent.

This proposal is similar to existing provisions for children of foreign diplomats born in the United States, who can acquire lawful immigration status through registration. Until this proposal is implemented, DHS suggests deferring immigration enforcement actions, including detention, removal, or deportation against these children, even though they may not be recognized as U.S. citizens under the proposed policy.

If the constitutionality of the executive order is upheld, a U.S. birth certificate alone would no longer suffice as proof of citizenship. Parents would need to provide documentation of the mother’s lawful status or the father’s citizen or permanent resident status.

Next Steps

With the executive order’s enforcement currently halted, the future of this policy remains uncertain. The Supreme Court will determine whether to uphold EO 14160, with significant implications for foreign nationals in the United States, depending on the scope of the ruling. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June or July of 2026.

In a speech that the White House billed as an address on the economy, amid a backlash driven in part by Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, Mr. Trump veered between assurances that life was better than ever under his administration and blaming immigrants for the country’s economic woes.

Mr. Trump revived what had been an effective campaign message, promising that sending immigrants home would mean “more jobs, better wages and higher income for American citizens,” though the early stages of his mass deportation campaign have so far coincided with widespread economic anxiety.

He earned raucous cheers from his supporters as he spoke of “reverse migration” and trumpeted what he called a “permanent pause” on immigration from “hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries.”

Soon after, a member of the crowd yelled out a crude term that Mr. Trump used during his first administration to disparage Haiti and some nations in Africa. The president laughed.

“I didn’t say ‘shithole,’ you did!” Mr. Trump replied with a grin. He then recounted his use of the term at a White House meeting in 2018 to describe countries that he was balking at accepting immigrants from. Mr. Trump had then denied saying that after it was publicly reported. Nearly six years later, he appeared proud of the remark.

Throughout the speech, Mr. Trump doubled down on a barrage of incendiary attacks that he has unleashed against immigrants since the shooting of two National Guard members near the White House last month. The day after the shooting, Mr. Trump floated the possibility of stripping naturalized American citizens of their citizenship (which is only done in rare cases) and vowed to deport all immigrants that he saw as “non-compatible with Western civilization.”

During his xenophobic tirade, Mr. Trump made little distinction between unauthorized migrants and those who followed all the correct procedures to enter the country and eventually become American citizens. He described Somali immigrants as lazy, murderous and “garbage,” and said the home countries of many immigrants were “filthy, dirty, disgusting.”

He singled out Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, referring to her hijab as “the little turban.” He again called for her to be deported, and the crowd responded by chanting, “Send her back.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/09/multimedia/09trump-news-somalia2-cbvk/09trump-news-somalia2-cbvk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 00:56:30.410889

Lisa Desjardins spoke with one man caught up in what authorities call the Portland sweep now entering its eighth week.

LISA DESJARDINS: Fifty-five-year-old construction worker Victor Cruz was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on his way home from work in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Eyewitness video posted on social media shows ICE agents in civilian clothes pulling him over and arresting him.

The grandfather of two entered the country illegally 26 years ago.

He has a construction business and a work permit.

Victor was detained in Tacoma, Washington, for three weeks.

Victor joins us now with his lawyer, Julia Braker.

Thank you to you both.

You were on your way back from work when you were detained.

Tell us what happened.

VICTOR CRUZ, Detained By ICE: As I saw them stop behind me, I knew that it was ICE.

They asked for my name.

As soon as I get off from my car, I told them that I have a permit to work legally here.

And one of the officers wanted me to show the I.D.

He told me: ""This means nothing to us.

For us, you are still an illegal.""

And they just cuffed me and chained me on -- around my waist, my ankles, and they put me in their vehicle.

LISA DESJARDINS: When you got in the vehicle, it seemed they were looking for someone else.

What did you hear?

VICTOR CRUZ: One of the officers have a picture of the man that they were looking for.

And they were talking just to each other, asking if it was me, if it was the person that they were looking for.

I was scared, terrified, and I was just thinking about my family.

I didn't know at that time if they knew that I was arrested or not.

So it was a terrifying moment.

As soon as they arrest me and we got into a facility, immigration facility in Portland, Oregon, they run my fingerprints.

And still they didn't found anything.

And the other officer just told me: ""Well, since you are here, we must take you to Tacoma.""

LISA DESJARDINS: You were detained for three weeks.

There are a lot of questions about how the Trump administration's handling detention.

What was your experience?

VICTOR CRUZ: They put us in this cell with A.C.

It was really cold.

And the room was -- it's made out of concrete.

The benches are concrete.

In the cell that I put in, in the beginning, it was 80 of us.

And the food also is not good.

It was a lot of hours between one meal to another.

LISA DESJARDINS: Julia, you and another attorney were able to get him out of detention.

What is his status right now?

JULIA BRAKER, Attorney For Victor Cruz: Mr.

Cruz has what's called deferred action status, which means that the Department of Homeland Security has looked at his application and decided that they're going to defer any removal or deportation on his case while his case is pending.

LISA DESJARDINS: But he was still detained despite having that status.

JULIA BRAKER: That's correct.

LISA DESJARDINS: Is that lawful, in your opinion?

JULIA BRAKER: No, because when the Department of Homeland Security makes such a determination, it goes in complete contradiction for it to then detain that person and put them into deportation proceedings.

LISA DESJARDINS: We did reach out to the Department of Homeland Security.

And here's what a spokesman told us about this case in particular.

She said: ""No one was arrested by mistake.

ICE will continue to arrest illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country.

Work authorization does not confer any legal status in this country.""

How do you respond to that statement from Homeland Security?

JULIA BRAKER: I think this statement by Homeland Security is an attempt to obfuscate the fact that Mr.

Cruz's rights were violated in the process of this arrest.

It simply doesn't make sense that the Department of Homeland Security would both grant him a status that explicitly says that he won't be removed and at the same time put him into removal proceedings.

LISA DESJARDINS: Victor, I want to ask you.

There is a fierce debate, of course, about immigration in this country right now, as you well know.

Some people argue that you broke the rules when you entered this country, you did it illegally, and that you should be forced to leave.

What do you say to those people?

VICTOR CRUZ: I don't know if people can say that it was a crime that I crossed the border without any proper documents.

But I can tell to them that they are getting the wrong people.

In the cell that I was in, like I said, it was about 80 people; 90 percent of those people that were in there had no records at all.

LISA DESJARDINS: You now have ankle monitoring.

Your work permit, you were not given that back.

What has this time meant for you and your family?

VICTOR CRUZ: I'm not able to go to work.

And it is awful, because I'm the main provider for my family.

So, it is kind of a scare knowing that the bills and that the rent are not going to wait for us.

My wife and I are very scared to even go outside to the store because there is still a lot of ICE activity around these neighborhoods.

We also discuss about what we're going to do in the case that I get detained again.

It is sad that all this has been happening, but I told my wife and kids that, if anything happens to me again, I just don't want to live the same nightmare again.

I will just sign my deportation right away, because I don't want to go through this again.

Sorry.

It was so hard, not only on me, on myself, but on my family.

They don't think that they can go through the same situation again.

While President Trump's targeted immigration sweeps in cities like New Orleans and Minneapolis have drawn national attention, the reach of his administration's policies extends far beyond those headlines.

Lisa Desjardins spoke with one man caught up in what authorities call the Portland sweep now entering its eighth week.

Lisa Desjardins:

Fifty-five-year-old construction worker Victor Cruz was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on his way home from work in Hillsboro, Oregon. Eyewitness video posted on social media shows ICE agents in civilian clothes pulling him over and arresting him.

The grandfather of two entered the country illegally 26 years ago. He has a construction business and a work permit. Victor was detained in Tacoma, Washington, for three weeks.

Victor joins us now with his lawyer, Julia Braker.

Thank you to you both.

You were on your way back from work when you were detained. Tell us what happened.

Victor Cruz, Detained By ICE:

As I saw them stop behind me, I knew that it was ICE.

They asked for my name. As soon as I get off from my car, I told them that I have a permit to work legally here. And one of the officers wanted me to show the I.D. He told me: ""This means nothing to us. For us, you are still an illegal.""

And they just cuffed me and chained me on — around my waist, my ankles, and they put me in their vehicle.

Lisa Desjardins:

When you got in the vehicle, it seemed they were looking for someone else. What did you hear?

Victor Cruz:

One of the officers have a picture of the man that they were looking for. And they were talking just to each other, asking if it was me, if it was the person that they were looking for.

I was scared, terrified, and I was just thinking about my family. I didn't know at that time if they knew that I was arrested or not. So it was a terrifying moment.

As soon as they arrest me and we got into a facility, immigration facility in Portland, Oregon, they run my fingerprints. And still they didn't found anything. And the other officer just told me: ""Well, since you are here, we must take you to Tacoma.""

Lisa Desjardins:

You were detained for three weeks. There are a lot of questions about how the Trump administration's handling detention. What was your experience?

Victor Cruz:

They put us in this cell with A.C. It was really cold. And the room was — it's made out of concrete. The benches are concrete.

In the cell that I put in, in the beginning, it was 80 of us. And the food also is not good. It was a lot of hours between one meal to another.

Lisa Desjardins:

Julia, you and another attorney were able to get him out of detention. What is his status right now?

Julia Braker, Attorney For Victor Cruz:

Mr. Cruz has what's called deferred action status, which means that the Department of Homeland Security has looked at his application and decided that they're going to defer any removal or deportation on his case while his case is pending.

Lisa Desjardins:

But he was still detained despite having that status.

Julia Braker:

That's correct.

Lisa Desjardins:

Is that lawful, in your opinion?

Julia Braker:

No, because when the Department of Homeland Security makes such a determination, it goes in complete contradiction for it to then detain that person and put them into deportation proceedings.

Lisa Desjardins:

We did reach out to the Department of Homeland Security.

And here's what a spokesman told us about this case in particular. She said: ""No one was arrested by mistake. ICE will continue to arrest illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country. Work authorization does not confer any legal status in this country.""

How do you respond to that statement from Homeland Security?

Julia Braker:

I think this statement by Homeland Security is an attempt to obfuscate the fact that Mr. Cruz's rights were violated in the process of this arrest.

It simply doesn't make sense that the Department of Homeland Security would both grant him a status that explicitly says that he won't be removed and at the same time put him into removal proceedings.

Lisa Desjardins:

Victor, I want to ask you. There is a fierce debate, of course, about immigration in this country right now, as you well know.

Some people argue that you broke the rules when you entered this country, you did it illegally, and that you should be forced to leave. What do you say to those people?

Victor Cruz:

I don't know if people can say that it was a crime that I crossed the border without any proper documents.

But I can tell to them that they are getting the wrong people. In the cell that I was in, like I said, it was about 80 people; 90 percent of those people that were in there had no records at all.

Lisa Desjardins:

You now have ankle monitoring. Your work permit, you were not given that back. What has this time meant for you and your family?

Victor Cruz:

I'm not able to go to work. And it is awful, because I'm the main provider for my family.

So, it is kind of a scare knowing that the bills and that the rent are not going to wait for us. My wife and I are very scared to even go outside to the store because there is still a lot of ICE activity around these neighborhoods.

We also discuss about what we're going to do in the case that I get detained again.

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote.
“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote.
""Remember, SAVE borrowers have not been in repayment for years.","Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, Los Angeles educators have said the increase in immigration enforcement actions contributed to more somber graduation ceremonies, lower attendance and fewer students enrolled in school this year.

Now, a new report from UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access finds similar scenarios are playing out on campuses across the country.

“There can sometimes be a sense that, well, we're facing a set of conditions that are unique to Los Angeles,” said UCLA education professor and report co-author John Rogers. “But every state in the nation, almost every community in the nation has high schools where young people are experiencing fear and concern for themselves and for their family members.”

UCLA researchers based the report on a nationally representative online survey of 606 high school principals and follow-up interviews with about four dozen administrators who said students from immigration families experienced:

Heightened concern: 70% said students from immigrant families were concerned about the well-being of themselves and their families because of policies and political rhetoric related to immigrants.

More absences: 64% said students from immigrant families missed school.

Loss of family members: 58% said immigrant parents and guardians left during the school year, sometimes without their children.

Bullying and harassment: 36% said students from immigrant families have been bullied or harassed at their school, in part because of a “political climate that has normalized attacks on immigrant communities.

LAist has reached out to the Trump administration for comment, but has not yet heard back.

LAUSD immigration resources

Los Angeles Unified School District offers resources for families concerned about immigration through its website.

Students’ right to an education

The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that undocumented immigrants have a constitutional right to attend public schools — there are an estimated 39,000 such students enrolled in Los Angeles County.

The number of students with at least one immigrant family member is much greater. For example, almost half of California children have at least one immigrant parent, according to a Public Policy Institute of California analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

How the nation’s principals are handling increased immigration enforcement at schools

On this episode of AirTalk, senior reporter Mariana Dale and UCLA professor John Rogers discuss a new report on a climate of fear in schools around federal immigration policy.

Maria Nichols leads the union that represents Los Angeles Unified School District principals and said that there’s widespread uncertainty among students, families and educators. She is also the daughter of an immigrant from South America who was undocumented for part of her childhood.

“Are we experiencing a crisis now with immigration? Absolutely,” Nichols said. “It's extremely traumatic. It's extremely triggering for people that, you know, lived the immigrant existence. And many of us in education in Los Angeles have lived that.”

In January, the Trump administration reversed a policy that made schools and other ""sensitive"" locations off limits to immigration enforcement actions. In early June, widespread immigration raids started across Southern California. Most arrested in L.A. and nationwide have no criminal record.

“I think a purpose of the federal immigration enforcement policies is to create a level of stress and uncertainty and fear,” Rogers said. “And precisely those dynamics make it hard to sustain student enrollment and student attendance at high levels.”

Rogers said the current climate can disrupt learning for students who do make it to school.

“The extent to which young people are concerned about their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families while they're at the school means there's less attention, less focus, less learning going on,” Rogers said.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has mostly blocked efforts to investigate misconduct within its ranks, according to the county inspector general, who announced his retirement Tuesday after 12 years on the job.

In an open letter, Max Huntsman cited examples of how the county has thwarted his efforts to watchdog the department, which in the past has been plagued with accusations that deputies use excessive force and lie on the job.

Huntsman said one example is former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s misuse of criminal enforcement powers to discredit critics, such as opening an investigation into former County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl.

Villanueva was sheriff from 2018 to 2022.

“My requests for investigation were rejected,” Huntsman’s letter reads. “Even after receiving an official subpoena, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to turn over records regarding the improper surveillance.”

He added: “Sometimes members of the public wonder if frightening new surveillance techniques will be used for improper purposes under the guise of criminal investigation. Sadly, the answer is yes.”

Before becoming inspector general in 2013, Huntsman, 60, was a deputy district attorney who specialized in public corruption. He told LAist on Tuesday that the inspector general job wasn’t something he wanted initially.

“I didn’t want to go work for politicians,” he said. “But the need to provide some kind of independent reporting and analysis was significant.”

The Sheriff’s Department issued a statement saying it valued the Office of the Inspector General and all county oversight bodies and that it wished Huntsman and his family well in his retirement.

The department said it “continues to make great strides in advancing the department in a transparent manner.”

LAist also reached out to the county CEO and county counsel for comment, but they declined.

After George Floyd

In the letter, Huntsman says the state of California has come a long way in strengthening the power of local law enforcement oversight bodies, in part because of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

After widespread protests — and lobbying by Huntsman — the state provided authority to inspectors general to enforce subpoenas requiring law enforcement agencies to hand over documents and authorized external investigation of police misconduct, including deputy gang conduct.

The Sheriff’s Department — backed by county lawyers — has resisted.

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote. “The county refuses to require the photographing of suspected gang tattoos in secretive groups that the undersheriff has identified as violating state law.”

“Just a few weeks ago, we requested some information regarding an investigation, and a pair of commanders refused to give it to us,” Huntsman said in an interview with LAist.

Origin of the office

The Inspector General’s Office was created by the county Board of Supervisors in 2013 in response to a scandal that included former Sheriff Lee Baca covering up the abuses of jail inmates.

Baca went to federal prison.

Since then, the office has issued dozens of reports with recommendations for improving living conditions inside jails that some have described as “filthy,” stopping abuses of juveniles inside juvenile halls and providing shower privacy for inmates as part of the requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.

“All of these abuses were reported by the Office of Inspector General and recommendations were ignored,” Huntsman wrote. Often, it took court orders to enact change.

“When we first blew the whistle on the torturous chaining of mentally ill prisoners to benches for 36 hours at a time, it was only a court order that ended the practice,” he wrote. “Time and time again, this pattern repeated itself.”

Huntsman wrote the county has permitted the Sheriff’s Department to block oversight and defunded the Office of Inspector General by removing a third of its staff.

“It's not surprising the county has driven out two successive chairs of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission,” he wrote.

“Government always claims to value transparency and accountability, but shooting the messenger is still the most common response to criticism,” Huntsman wrote.

Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work

Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.

“I’ve really enjoyed the work and I’m sad to have it end,” he said.

It’s a sentiment he echoed in his letter, adding that despite the setbacks and roadblocks, he was proud of the people with whom he shared the office.

“It has been my honor to work with a talented, brave and tireless group of public servants to ensure that the public knows what its government is doing,” he wrote.

He noted the inspector general’s reports are fact-checked by the office and public.

“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote. “What you do about it is up to you.,”

Huntsman’s last day is Friday.

The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday that it had reached a proposed settlement agreement to end a popular, yet controversial Biden-era student loan repayment plan.

The Saving on a Valuable Education plan, better known as SAVE, was the most flexible and generous of all income-driven repayment plans, promising expedited loan forgiveness and monthly payments as low as $0 for low-income borrowers. Republican state attorneys general, led by Missouri, sued the Biden administration, arguing in court that SAVE was too generous.

The legal challenges put all SAVE borrowers in limbo for months, during which they were not required to make payments on their loans — even after many had already spent years in a pandemic payment pause. Interest resumed accruing on SAVE loans in August.

""The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,"" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement announcing the proposed agreement. ""Thanks to the State of Missouri and other states fighting against this egregious federal overreach, American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.""

Tuesday's agreement, pending court approval, would end the long legal battle over SAVE by ending SAVE itself. The Education Department would commit not to enroll more borrowers in SAVE, to deny all pending SAVE applications and to move the roughly 7 million borrowers still enrolled in SAVE into other repayment plans — though some of those plans are also in flux.

The department also said student loan borrowers would have ""a limited time to select a new, legal repayment plan."" Borrowers will have to choose between two types of plans: 1.) fixed payment plans or 2.) plans with payments based on a borrower's income.

The two new plans created by Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will roll out in July 2026, and will include a revised standard plan and a new income-driven plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. Though SAVE borrowers will be expected to change plans before then.

The SAVE plan's days were already numbered. Under the OBBBA, borrowers would have had to change plans by July 1, 2028. Tuesday's news would move that deadline up, though the administration has not provided a timeframe for the changes.

If the proposal is approved by the court, transitioning millions of borrowers to other plans will be a Herculean feat for loan servicing companies that handle day-to-day loan operations.

""It's gonna be bumpy,"" says Scott Buchanan, head of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance. ""Remember, SAVE borrowers have not been in repayment for years. They're gonna have a ton of questions and will need a ton of hand-holding to get back into repayment.""

The settlement arrives as millions of borrowers are struggling to keep up with their payments.

""We are sitting on the precipice of millions of borrowers defaulting on their loans,"" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers. ""And instead of choosing to defend a plan that would have been affordable for these borrowers, this Department of Education has capitulated to the AGs and is going to make life much more expensive.""

The American Enterprise Institute, AEI, recently published an analysis of the latest federal student loan data: In addition to the 5.5 million borrowers who are currently in default, another 3.7 million are more than 270 days late on their payments and on the edge of default. Another 2.7 million borrowers are in the earlier stages of delinquency. In all, some 12 million borrowers are worryingly behind.

Illinois courthouses are now off-limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents hoping to make an immigration arrest. Pritzker signed a bill into law that bars immigration enforcement inside or within 1,000 feet of a courthouse building.

""The idea that the Trump administration wants to prevent people from attending courts, doing their civic duty, and protecting public safety just boggles the mind,"" Pritzker said.

Since the Department of Homeland Security's Chicago-area immigration operation ""Midway Blitz"" began in September, Pritzker says, only 2.6% of the people arrested by ICE in the Chicago area were considered high public safety risks by the federal government.

Agents have shown up at places of employment, including a day care center. Churches, schools, college campuses, and hospitals have been targets as well.

""Before the bill was signed into law, ICE will just tell a hospital, you don't have the authority to tell us anything. Now, you do,"" said Democratic Illinois House Speaker Chris Welch.

Illinois' new law also requires hospitals, public universities and community colleges and day care facilities to develop plans and procedures in case federal immigration agents show up at their establishments.

""With daycare centers, it's part of the licensing process with the hospitals. It's also part of the licensing process,"" said Fred Tsao with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights.

The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee and other immigration groups worked with Democratic state leaders to write the legislation. The bill also allows people subject to civil arrest the ability to sue law enforcement officers who violate the constitution.

""No one, and I mean no one, is above the law,"" Pritzker said.

But Republicans and the Trump administration argue Pritzker is acting above the law. In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, wrote, in part, ""He must be unfamiliar with the US Constitution.... By signing this law, Pritzker violated the Supremacy Clause.""

The governor says he's not worried if his bill is legally challenged.

""No doubt, they have the ability to go to court about it, but I believe this is a not just a good law, but a great law,"" Pritzker said.

The courthouse element of the bill goes into effect on Tuesday. Entities like daycare centers and hospitals have been given various deadlines between January and March to provide their ICE organizational plans.

Full statement from McLaughlin:

""He must be unfamiliar with the US Constitution. Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution, still clearly states:

'This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.'

By signing this law, Pritzker violated the Supremacy Clause, his oath he took as Governor to ""support the Constitution of the United States"" - which itself falls under the oaths clause of the Constitution.

Illinois’ “ICE out” legislation was approved this fall by Democratic state lawmakers in response to the Trump administration’s enhanced immigration enforcement being carried out across the Chicago area.
“No one, and I mean, no one is above the law, especially those wearing a badge representing the law,” Pritzker said.
The governor and legislative leaders have acknowledged the law is likely to draw court challenges, which Pritzker took in stride.
And no doubt, they have the ability to go to court about it, but I believe this is not just a good law, but a great law,” Pritzker said.","Gov. JB Pritzker signed legislation Tuesday that bars civil immigration arrests from being made in or near courthouses, and gives residents more leeway to sue federal agents over alleged civil rights violations.

Illinois’ “ICE out” legislation was approved this fall by Democratic state lawmakers in response to the Trump administration’s enhanced immigration enforcement being carried out across the Chicago area.

Republicans roundly opposed the measure, predicting legal challenges over whether the state can block federal action of any sort.

But Pritzker and supporters aiming to stem the fear gripping immigrant communities declared that Illinois, “in the face of cruelty and intimidation, has chosen solidarity and support.”

“The idea that the Trump administration wants to prevent people from attending court, doing their civic duty and protecting public safety just boggles the mind,” Pritzker said before signing the legislation at La Villita Community Church. “With my signature today, we are trying to protect people and institutions that belong here in Illinois. Dropping your kid off at daycare, going to the doctor, attending classes, should not be a life-altering risk.”

The new state law takes effect immediately, prohibiting immigration arrests inside or within 1,000 feet of state courthouses, which have been the sites of deportation operations over the past few months by federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection.

Department of Homeland Security officials have asserted “nothing in the Constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.” In an email, Assistant Sec. Tricia McLaughlin said “by signing this law, Pritzker violated the Supremacy Clause... We hope the headlines, social media likes, and fundraising emails he did this for are worth it!”

Federal officials say they’ve made thousands of arrests as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began winding down last month with U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino heading to North Carolina to ramp up enforcement there. Few of those taken into custody have violent criminal records, the Sun-Times has found.

Immigration raids are still happening across the Chicago area, and enforcement could be ramped up even further in the spring, sources have told the Sun-Times.

“Donald Trump, [Homeland Security Sec.] Kristi Noem, and Gregory Bovino have tried to appeal to our lesser instincts, but the best of us are standing up to the worst of them,” Pritzker said.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said if “Pritzker the Slob focused on fixing crime in his own state instead of defending criminal illegal aliens, Illinois residents would be much safer. Cracking down on crime and deporting dangerous criminal illegal aliens should not be a partisan issue, but Democrats suffering from TDS are trying to make it one, all at the expense of the Americans they are elected to serve.”

Illinois’ new law also requires hospitals, day care facilities and public universities to institute plans for how to deal with immigration agents who might show up at their facilities, and it bars them from sharing most residents’ information with federal agents.

It also opens the door to litigation against federal officials who “knowingly violated Constitutional rights during civil immigration enforcement operations.” Higher punitive damages can be sought against officers who fail to identify themselves, deploy tear gas or use some of the other inflammatory tactics that have angered communities this year.

“No one, and I mean, no one is above the law, especially those wearing a badge representing the law,” Pritzker said.

The governor and legislative leaders have acknowledged the law is likely to draw court challenges, which Pritzker took in stride.

“Whenever you enact something that is tough, that is about protecting people, there are going to be people out there who attack it. And no doubt, they have the ability to go to court about it, but I believe this is not just a good law, but a great law,” Pritzker said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6a107c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F84%2Fad%2Fbb9d33ca43f3b40842979e41e98b%2Ficelaw-121025-09.JPG,N,,2025-12-09 19:58:28.527352

The ECHR, which underpins the UK’s Human Rights Act, is seen by critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants.

The right to family life, enshrined by Article 8 of the agreement, is often used as grounds in legal cases to prevent removals.

The Home Office has also said it has seen a trend of Article 3 rights, which prohibit torture, being used to halt deportations because of claims that migrants’ healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Sir Keir has rejected calls by the Conservatives and Reform UK to quit the ECHR over concerns that it would prevent the UK from striking agreements with signatory countries to tackle illegal migration.

‘Yesterday’s answers do not work’

In the joint op-ed in The Guardian, the Prime Minister and Ms Fredriksen acknowledged that the “current asylum framework was created for another era”.

The pair added: “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed and asylum systems must change with it.”

The UK has adopted a series of hardline immigration measures, modelled on those spearheaded by Ms Frederiksen’s government, in order to reduce Channel crossings by migrants.

The two leaders also wrote: “Migration must be orderly, managed and sustainable. Irregular routes should not be the go-to option – so we must dismantle the human smuggling networks that prey on desperation.

“Together, we are calling on our friends across Europe to go further in tackling these shared challenges.”

Europe ‘must act together’

On Wednesday, European ministers, including David Lammy, the Deputy Prime Minister, are due to meet in Strasbourg to discuss reforming how the treaty is interpreted in the courts.

A political declaration signed by the ministers could carry enough weight to influence directly how the European Court of Human Rights interprets the agreement, it is understood.

The joint op-ed described the efforts as a “push for a modernisation of the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights – so that the convention system, which we believe in, can evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.”

They’ve destroyed our country. We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.” “People from Somalia aren’t garbage. When I heard it the first time, it was heartbreaking. Because, not for myself, because I know I’m not.” Munira Maalimisaq runs a primary care clinic in Minneapolis. “To have the president of the United States say these things, I think it feels like I definitely don’t belong.” Minnesota is home to around 80,000 Somalis, many of whom were either born here or have been here for decades.

On the church’s Facebook page, reaction to the Nativity scene was split.","Leaders of a Catholic church near Boston kept a Nativity display with an anti-ICE message in place on Monday, defying an order from the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston to remove it.

The display, outside St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Mass., includes the traditional shepherds, sheep and wise men gathered around a hay-filled manger. But Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus are missing, replaced by a sign reading “ICE WAS HERE” in bold blue letters.

“The Holy Family is safe in the Sanctuary of our Church,” adds a smaller note inside the Nativity scene, which is protected by a plastic shield. “If you see ICE please call LUCE.” The display includes a phone number for LUCE, an immigrant advocacy group, which tracks the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Massachusetts.

ICE began a major immigration enforcement campaign in the Boston area in September, the forefront of a wave of similar efforts in other major cities.

Speaking to reporters late Monday outside the brick church, the Rev. Stephen Josoma said the intent of the display was to “evoke dialogue,” not cause a furor. He said parish leaders would confer with leaders of the archdiocese before making a final decision on its fate.

But, he added, “that some do not agree with our display does not render it sacrilegious.”

Last week, the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston told the parish to take down the signage in its Nativity display. In a statement, archdiocesan leaders said that churchgoers “have the right to expect that they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging.”

That statement also cited church norms prohibiting “the use of sacred objects for any purpose other than the devotion of God’s people.”

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, added his own criticism in recent days, telling The Boston Herald that the Nativity scene was “absolutely abhorrent” and part of “a dangerous narrative” responsible for a sharp increase in assaults on ICE officers.

Some members and supporters of the Dedham parish said they were confused by the demand from the archdiocese, which came one month after a rare and nearly unanimous statement from U.S. Catholic bishops condemning the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.

“We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants,” the November statement from the bishops said. “We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care. We lament that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status.”

The display at St. Susanna, on a busy street in a well-off suburb south of Boston, is the latest in a series of nontraditional Nativity scenes staged by the parish. A version in 2018 sparked similar controversy for depicting the infant Jesus in a cage, a scene church leaders said was a reflection on immigration policy at that time. A year later, the parish focused on climate change, showing some of the figures partly submerged in water.

Other politically themed Nativity scenes have popped up around the country this Christmas season, including one at a church in Evanston, Ill., that includes a baby Jesus figure with his hands bound by zip ties. In another Nativity scene near Chicago, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are missing, with a sign telling viewers that “Due to ICE activity in our community, the Holy Family is in hiding.”

Catholics in Massachusetts tend to be more liberal than church members elsewhere, and many have defended the Dedham parish. On the church’s Facebook page, reaction to the Nativity scene was split. Some commenters thanked the congregation for “speaking truth to power,” while others offered harsh judgments, including one assertion that “the devil has infiltrated the church.”

“How shameful to make a mockery of Christ’s birth,” one observer wrote.

“You are on the right side of history,” countered another.

“I wish I lived close enough to attend this church,” one woman lamented.

Elizabeth Doris-Gustin, 67, a longtime neighbor of the parish who attends an Episcopal church, said she and many of her neighbors look forward to the Christmas displays at St. Susanna every year.

“You might not agree with everything, but it makes you think,” she said. “I wish a few more churches would be this bold.”

She hopes the parish will keep this year’s display, she said. “I’m going to say a little prayer that they keep it up.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/08nat-nativity-ice-jfmz/08nat-nativity-ice-jfmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 19:58:00.518226

Troy Edgar was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in March, making him eligible for the new role without further Senate approval. No start date has been set yet, but it's likely to be soon, two sources said.

Spokespeople for the White House and Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately comment. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Edgar have had a good working relationship, multiple sources say.

El Salvador has played a high-profile role in the Trump administration's sweeping illegal immigration crackdown. The president in March invoked a 200-year-old wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to send migrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador as he sought to deport individuals his administration accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. CBS News previously reported that many of the men do not have criminal convictions.

The men imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a U.S.-brokered swap over the summer. A report by human rights groups last month determined that the deportation and treatment of the more than 200 Venezuelan migrants at the prison amounted to arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearance under international law.

Mr. Trump met in April with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has won the admiration of conservatives in the U.S. for his crackdown on gangs under a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation without due process.

Last month, the administration reached a framework for reciprocal trade agreements with South and Central American countries including El Salvador.

In a court filing Monday evening, attorneys for detainees highlighted the government's own admissions to longer custody times for immigrant children, unsanitary conditions reported by families and monitors at federal facilities, and a renewed reliance on hotels for detention.

The reports were filed as part of an ongoing civil lawsuit launched in 1985 that led to the creation of the 1990s cornerstone policy known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, which limits the time children can spend in federal custody and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The Trump administration is attempting to end the agreement.

A Dec. 1 report from ICE indicated that about 400 immigrant children were held in custody for more than the 20-day limit during the reporting period from August to September. They also told the court the problem was widespread and not specific to a region or facility. The primary factors that prolonged their release were categorized into three groups: transportation delays, medical needs, and legal processing.

Legal advocates for the children contended those reasons do not prove lawful justifications for the delays in their release. They also cited examples that far exceeded the 20-day limit, including five children who were held for 168 days earlier this year.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Hotel use for temporary detention is allowed by the federal court for up to 72 hours, but attorneys questioned the government's data, which they believe did not fully explain why children were held longer than three days in hotel rooms.

Conditions at the detention facilities continued to be an ongoing concern since the family detention site in Dilley, Texas, reopened this year.

Advocates documented injuries suffered by children and a lack of access to sufficient medical care. One child bleeding from an eye injury wasn't seen by medical staff for two days. Another child's foot was broken when a member of the staff dropped a volleyball net pole, according to the court filing. “Medical staff told one family whose child got food poisoning to only return if the child vomited eight times,” the advocates wrote in their response.

“Children get diarrhea, heartburn, stomach aches, and they give them food that literally has worms in it,"" one person with a family staying at the facility in Dilley wrote in a declaration submitted to the court.

Chief U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee of the Central District of California is scheduled to have a hearing on the reports next week, where she could decide if the court needs to intervene.

Before a crucial European summit on Wednesday, the prime minister urged fellow members to “go further” in modernising the interpretation of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) to prevent asylum seekers using it to avoid deportation.

But Labour has been condemned for calling for changes, with human rights campaigners, Labour peers and some MPs arguing they could open the door to countries abandoning some of the world’s most vulnerable people.

Critics of the government’s asylum changes also argue that the prime minister should not be diluting protections that pander to the right, amid deepening concerns from charities that its rhetoric could demonise refugees.

On the eve of the Council of Europe summit in Strasbourg, the actors Michael Palin, Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley were among 21 well-known figures calling on Starmer to drop plans to weaken human rights law and instead “take a principled stand” for torture victims.

Under sweeping changes announced last month, the government said it wanted to introduce measures to stop asylum seekers using their rights in the ECHR to a family life to avoid deportation. The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for withdrawal from the convention altogether.

But writing for the Guardian, the prime minister said that updating the interpretation of the convention was urgently required to confront the challenges posed by mass migration – and far-right forces that sought to divide mainstream opinion across Europe.

“The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division, is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem,” he wrote in a joint article with the Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen.

“Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about. That’s not empty populism, it’s democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.”

The two leaders called on European allies to go further in tackling the shared challenge of migration by modernising the ECHR to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.

“Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.

“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”

The UK has sought to emulate Denmark’s hardline asylum model. Last year, the number of people being granted asylum in the country was the lowest in 40 years, excluding 2020 which was during the Covid pandemic.

The government, which will be represented at the Strasbourg meeting by David Lammy, the justice secretary, and Richard Hermer, the attorney general, is understood to be considering all options to update the implementation of the ECHR.

The proposed political declaration resulting from the summit would carry significant political weight and, if it garnered enough signatories, could directly influence how the European court of human rights interprets and applies ECHR rights.

The government has already said it will legislate to clarify how article 8, the right to a private life, is interpreted in the domestic courts in regard to immigration rules.

Lammy is expected to argue on Wednesday that the ECHR could also be reinterpreted to limit the scope of rights under article 3, which prohibits torture and “degrading treatment”.

This could, for example, include higher thresholds for prison conditions or access to healthcare abroad where it currently prevents extradition or deportation from the UK.

The deputy prime minister will reassert the UK’s commitment to the ECHR, saying that pulling out would be a “fake solution” that would undermine every international agreement on national and border security.

At the summit, he is expected to say: “We must strike a careful balance between individual rights and the public’s interest, otherwise we risk a loss of confidence in the convention, and in human rights themselves.

“The definition of ‘family life’ can’t be stretched to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country … The threshold of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ must be constrained to the most serious issues.

“States must be able to take proportionate decisions on the removal of foreign criminals, so that we renew the convention’s democratic foundation.”

The sweeping changes to the UK asylum system came against the backdrop of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK attracting support because of the failure of successive governments to stop unauthorised small boat crossings in the Channel and unease about the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.

They include measures such as forcing people with refugee status to return to their home country if it becomes safe, making people who arrive illegally wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement, and revoking the statutory legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances.

Ministers say the government will introduce new safe and legal routes to the UK as a way to reduce the number of dangerous journeys in small boats across the Channel, although these routes will be capped.

Some Labour MPs, charities and legal experts have warned that if a country such as the UK waters down the application of article 3, then less scrupulous nations could follow suit, with horrific implications.

Veronika Fikfak, a professor of international law at University College London, said a change to the anti-torture provisions within the ECHR “touches the very core” of the convention.

“Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment is an absolute right. It allows for no balancing. There is no margin of appreciation for states, nor any deference to them,” she said.

Lammy will meet ministers from 45 other countries to discuss possible changes at the meeting. Nine member states, including Italy and Denmark, signed a letter in May calling for the scope of the ECHR to be limited.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/046aad03b4ac071705e796125982e962cf6d0601/327_0_2990_2392/master/2990.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=893dabaf29e7685be2007aad083f4f25",N,,2025-12-09 19:57:53.014253

As protesters yelled at the agents, blew whistles and honked car horns, agents could be seen spraying the chemical irritant from their unmarked vehicles and getting out to aim the canister inches from a protester’s face.

“I lost my voice. I was blind for about 30 minutes,” said Khalid Mohamed, a witness at the scene. “The pepper spray they used was so strong that it blinded me for 30 minutes, actually.”

Multiple witnesses said prior to the chaos, agents were going up and down the street asking people if they had IDs and proof of citizenship.

“We said it’s wrong that we live in 2025 and our own government’s coming to our neighborhood and asking us for our citizenship,” Mohamed said. “This is not 1930s Germany.”

“The abduction of these students is unconscionable,” state Sen.

ICE arrests in the Pittsburgh region reached a high point in July and August at around 140 each month — more than double the number logged during any month for two years prior.

That arrest level appears to have tapered off slightly in September, as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown approaches the end of its first year.

Since January, there have been at least 948 immigration-related arrests in the Pittsburgh region, defined as a 50-mile radius from Downtown, according to the data, which ends in mid-October. That is more than triple the same period in 2024, during which the agency made 275 arrests.

Data Deportation Project. Datawrapper)

Prior to President Donald Trump’s inauguration and his Immigration and Customs Enforcement surge, the number of ICE arrests in Allegheny County and nearby counties in a given month was sometimes as low as a dozen or as high as 65. The range this year has been a low of 48 in April before the summer peak, according to data made available by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Pittsburgh’s Public Source.

The data shows the vast majority of the ICE arrests as occurring in or close to Pittsburgh and is only more specific in regard to pickups at county jails. Just one of this year’s ICE arrests is listed as occurring at the Allegheny County Jail, with outlying county lockups logging larger tallies, led by Beaver (23), Washington (18) and Butler (10).

The region has not seen the kind of highly publicized ICE surges experienced by numerous other cities, including recent pushes in and around Minneapolis, Charlotte and Chicago.

But Southwestern Pennsylvania hasn’t been ignored by the rapidly expanding agency. The administration’s immigration-related activities have reached the area in many ways throughout the year, including:

November efforts to enlist local law enforcement agencies in enforcement activity, some of which were recently reversed after Public Source inquiries

September moves to deport Guatemalan children, which were stalled by court decisions but caused local advocates to scramble over Labor Day weekend

August arrests of workers at local restaurants

A midsummer blitz in Ambridge that some advocates for immigrants characterized as the most aggressive they’d seen

Winter disruptions of funding for refugee resettlement and for legal representation of immigrant children

A January pause in refugee entry, which has since morphed nationally into a halt to processing of applications from 19 countries following the November shooting of two National Guard members — one fatally — in Washington, D.C.

ICE’s increased activity has been met locally with vigorous countermeasures, notably including a Rapid Response Network that has frequently deployed volunteers to document enforcement actions. Anti-Trump protests and other activism in the region have sometimes focused tightly on immigration policy, highlighted the importance of immigrants to the economy or included those themes in broad critiques of the administration. Churches, meanwhile, have attempted to serve as spiritual sanctuaries for the region’s Latino population, even as attendance has sometimes been depressed by fear.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice-arrests-ambridge.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 19:58:21.034416

Maria Elvira Salazar has recently done?

Salazar on Sunday joined a growing chorus of South Florida leaders who have decried the administration’s targeting of Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians and other immigrants. Recently, a billboard along Interstate 95 featuring four civic leaders, among them Miami Dade College President Emeritus Eduardo Padrón, called on Miamians to defend “our immigrant neighbors.”

But that message is stronger when it comes from an elected Republican — especially one elected to Congress — in a county Trump carried by 11 points in 2024. Republicans can no longer ignore that Trump isn’t just going after criminals but is casting a wide net that’s catching immigrants who are following the rules.

Salazar, who’s Cuban-American and sponsored an immigration reform bill called the “Dignity Act,” issued a statement describing as “un-American” the Trump administration’s decision to order a pause of all immigration applications from nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and other so-called “high risk” countries. The policy affects green card and citizenship applications and other immigration applications for people from 19 countries. All asylum claims have also been paused regardless of the applicant’s country of origin, the Herald reported. The directive was a response to the Nov. 26 shooting in Washington, D.C. of two National Guardsmen, allegedly by an Afghan man.

“Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process,” Salazar wrote. “That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for. Background checks already exist to stop terrorists and they should.”

The new policy has already inflicted unnecessary pain. Naturalization ceremonies in South Florida have been cancelled, several immigration attorneys told the Herald. The same appears to be happening across the country. In Boston, at least two immigrants were told to step out of line before they could pledge allegiance to the U.S., the Boston Globe reported.

These individuals have lived in the U.S. legally for years. However, they’re now being turned away in what seems to be Trump’s desire to leverage the tragedy in D.C. to target immigrants from “third world countries,” in the president’s own words.

Another Republican, Miami-Dade County Commissioner Rene Garcia, recently joined members of the Cuban American Bar Association in calling out the Trump administration for ignoring due process and detaining people at their immigration hearings.

“I’m seeing more and more cases in my office and of people who are saying, ‘This is my loved one, who had no criminal history, and now we don’t know where he is,’ No. 1, or, No. 2, has been deported or is in the process of being deported,” Garcia, a lawyer, told Channel 10 in late November.

We commend Garcia and Salazar, but they shouldn’t be part of a small group of vocal Republicans. The GOP has established political dominance in Miami-Dade; Republicans make up a majority of the county’s delegation in Congress and the Florida Legislature.

Now contrast what Salazar wrote to the statement her fellow Miami Republican congressmen issued after the Trump administration halted immigration applications.

“President Trump inherited a number of problems, including a broken immigration system made worse by the Biden Administration . President Trump is protecting national security by restoring order, enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening vetting. That leadership is saving American lives,” U.S. Reps. Carlos Gimenez and Mario Diaz-Balart wrote on Dec. 3.

The two congressmen have in the past spoken in favor of immigrant protections, in particular Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans, and Balart has long advocated for immigration reform. But their latest statement, issued as people are reportedly being pulled out of their citizenship ceremonies, rings tone-deaf when it’s been almost a year since Biden left office.

We cannot ignore the political realities that must weigh heavily on Miami Republicans. Salazar’s District 27 is not as solidly red as the districts of Gimenez and Diaz-Balart, pushing her toward the political middle. But this should not be the moment for electoral calculations. More Republicans must speak up.

This “Behind the Brief” accompanies Policy & Advocacy’s Brief from Volume 9, Issue No. 3, “The Danger of Globally Institutionalizing Third Country Returns,” originally published on November 19, 2025. You can find the complete brief at the end.

Reason Behind the Brief

Return hubs and third country returns are two migration control measures that have gained appeal with policymakers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. These measures are being used to transfer noncitizens outside of national borders. Third country deportations are different from migration externalization measures that have been widely used for many years but which became particularly pervasive at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Here’s how return hubs and third country returns compare to externalization measures:

Safe Third Country Agreements

Country A can deem an individual ineligible for asylum and remove them to Country B, which is deemed safe, if the individual is deemed to have a connection or have passed through Country B before reaching Country A.

Example: U.S.-Canada (but see legal controversies on this agreement)

Metering

Country A limits the number of asylum seekers processed at ports of entry, forcing asylum seekers to turn back to contiguous Country B to wait for an opportunity to seek admission into Country A. Asylum seekers may have been turned back before or after arriving in Country A.

Example: U.S.-Mexico border (2016-2020)

Offshoring

An asylum seeker arrives in and applies for asylum in Country A. Country A transfers them to Country B, forcing the asylum seeker to wait there while Country A processes their asylum application.

Examples: U.S. Title 42 Expulsions (2020-2023), Australia-Nauru (2001-2023), UK-Rwanda (agreement formalized in 2022, scrapped in 2024 before individuals were deported), Italy-Albania (2023-present)

Return Hubs

Country A issues a final order of removal to a noncitizen who has exhausted their asylum application and appeals but who cannot be deported to their country of origin, for reasons of ongoing conflict, risk of torture or cruel or inhumane treatment, or rejection by the country of origin to accept the individual. Country A seeks a diplomatic agreement with Country B. Country A may pay for housing, legal, food, medical, and administrative fees in exchange for Country B accepting noncitizens.

Proposed by: The EU, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands

Third Country Deportations

Country A enters into a diplomatic agreement with Country B to accept third country noncitizens who are deported from Country A. Country A deports noncitizens with humanitarian-based protections who cannot be removed to their country origin, noncitizens who have criminal convictions, and noncitizens who are not under a period of authorized stay to Country B, without adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to challenge the removal. Upon landing in Country B, third country noncitizens are under the jurisdiction of Country B and may be removed to their country of origin, where they may face persecution or torture.

While seemingly similar to return hubs, third country deportations are less formal and executed via separate agreements with each country. Key differences from the EU return hub proposals and the U.S. practice include deporting people without adequate notice of a final order of removal and providing lump-sum payments to countries for their cooperation, rather than funding temporary housing and other services to the deported individual.

In the past half decade, there has been a concerted effort by Global North countries to institutionalize third country removals. Many of the proposals and bilateral agreements detailed in the P&A Brief have been accompanied by domestic legislative changes. These legislative changes are resulting in the codification of the erosion of human rights for migrants and asylum seekers into national laws.

The UK-Rwanda agreement was officially signed in December 2023, and the UK Parliament passed a law in April 2024 allowing the removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda. In July 2024, the new Labour Government moved to end the UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership

The EU Common System for Returns (proposal for regulation) is being reviewed by the European Parliament and is expected to be in operation in 2026.

In December 2024, Australia passed the Migration Amendment Bill, which allows Australia to enter into third country deportation agreements. The bill does not include any requirements for a potential third country to have signed any refugee or human rights treaties, increasing the risk of refoulement. Australia is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.

International Human Rights Frameworks

Return hubs and third country deportations are a human rights concern because a crucial question is not being asked: “If deported to Country B (a third country), does the individual face a risk of persecution or torture?” To follow international refugee law, this question must be asked and answered on an individual basis and requires case-by-case review.

A key instrument outlining international refugee law is the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the 1967 Protocol (“Refugee Convention”). The United States participated in the drafting of the Refugee Convention and acceded to the 1967 Protocol, which incorporated the 1951 Convention. The Refugee Act of 1980 codified the United States’ obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol, establishing a legal framework for refugee admissions and asylum protections.

The Refugee Convention requires countries to:

Afford rights and protections outlined in the Refugee Convention to all refugees without discrimination (Art. 3).

The Refugee Convention prohibits a country from deporting a refugee to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. Countries cannot suspend or opt out of this obligation (Art. 33). Also prohibited is deporting a refugee lawfully present on grounds of national security or public order. Expulsions should be done in accordance with due process of law, where the refugee has an opportunity to submit evidence and appeal. (Art. 32)

Rights and protections outlined in the Refugee Convention are rooted in fundamental human rights. Fundamental human rights are universal and non-derogable, meaning that every human being must be able to enjoy them. Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all human beings, including noncitizens, must be afforded:

The right to all fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination based on race, language, religion, or nationality (Art. 2);

The right to seek and enjoy asylum (Art. 14);

The right to leave their own country (Art. 13);

The right not to be tortured (Art. 5);

The right to life, liberty, and security (Art. 3) ;

The right not be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile (Art. 9);

The right to be recognized before the law and the right to be equal before the law (Arts. 6 and 7); and

The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent tribunal (Arts. 10 and 11).

Other human rights treaties also codify and further specify rights that must be afforded to all persons, including noncitizens.

3 of the Convention against Torture prohibits refoulement of a person to another country where they would be in danger of being subject to torture. To make this determination, authorities must consider whether there is a “consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights” in the country.

The Committee against Torture specifically stated that this absolute duty applies to third country deportations. A country should not deport an individual to another country from which the individual faces deportation to a third country where they would be in danger of being subject to torture. To ensure that this duty is absolute, the Committee has stated that each case should be given due process in a transparent process with adequate notification of intended deportation. Detention and other coercive measures should not be used to compel people to relinquish their rights. Furthermore, countries that have signed onto the Convention have a duty to prevent torture by implementing safeguards.

Narrowing the Right to Remain

Despite the international legal framework, countries are limiting these rights by ignoring them on an individual basis and haphazardly condemning wide groups, particularly noncitizens who have criminal convictions. In order to uphold the principle of non-refoulement, countries have a duty to ensure that each individual gets a case-by-case review, a chance to appeal, and a chance to exhaust other options. Countries like the United States and the UK are seeking to narrow these rights.

In August 2025, the UK increased a list of countries they deemed “safe” to 23 countries. That means nationals of those countries can be deported under the “Deport Now Appeal Later” scheme. Under the scheme, nationals of “safe countries” who have been convicted of a crime in the UK can be deported to those countries before they can appeal their humanitarian-based immigration decisions in a UK court. If individuals decide to appeal, they are allowed to do so only from overseas, via video conference.

The U.S. third country deportation scheme has repeatedly deported noncitizens who have criminal convictions without due process, putting them at risk of being returned to countries where they could face harm. Such policies perpetuate a belief that people convicted of crimes are not only undeserving of international refugee protection but manipulating the system. There are also examples of individuals without criminal convictions being deported to third countries. Recent political rhetoric has unfairly cast criminal suspicion on entire immigrant populations due to individual alleged acts. Public safety and immigration are often separate and unrelated domestic issues, but politicians too often conflate the two to enflame fear and xenophobia.

As advocates, we will continue to track third country deportation schemes and human rights abuses wherever they are. Follow along with us by viewing our third country deportations tracker here. Stay tuned for further updates on third country deportations.

Dear MP

I am one of your constituents. I am writing to raise my deep concern at the immigration and asylum proposals set out in the Government papers Restoring Order and Control and A Fairer Pathway to Settlement published last month. Amnesty International UK has produced two short briefings on the proposals set out in these papers (these can be found here and here)

Among the proposals relating to asylum are that:

1. People recognised as refugees in the UK’s asylum system will be permitted to stay for only 30 months before being required to apply again for asylum (for another 30 months period). They will have no prospect of applying for permission to settle (permanent residence) until at least 20 years have passed since they were first granted asylum. This is a radical departure from past policy – though it is based in part on harmful proposals first introduced by a Conservative Home Secretary (Priti Patel) via the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

2. Refugee family reunion, which the Government suspended in September, is to be largely closed. People recognised as refugees in the UK’s asylum system will only be permitted to sponsor their partners and children to obtain a visa to join them if they have substantial earnings or savings. This is a radical departure from past policy – though it too is based in part on harmful proposals first introduced by a Conservative Home Secretary (Priti Patel) via the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

3. There will no longer be a duty on the Government to accommodate people who are waiting for their asylum claims to be determined and would otherwise be destitute. This is similar to a failed and harmful policy introduced by a Labour Home Secretary (David Blunkett) under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

4. The Government will increase its use of disused or repurposed military and similar sites as mass accommodation for people seeking asylum. The use of such sites by successive Governments since a Labour Home Secretary (Jack Straw) opened an immigration removal centre at Oakington barracks near Cambridge in 2000 has been a longstanding matter of considerable local and national controversy, which has done real harm to many people.

5. The Government will establish a limited visa route to permit refugees whom it regards as particularly “talented” or “skilled” to relocate to the UK.

Among proposals that also relate to other immigration are that:

1. The Government will legislate to restrict the application of Article 8 (the right to respect for private and family life) in immigration and asylum cases. A Conservative Home Secretary (Theresa May) did this via the Immigration Act 2014.

2. The Government will legislate to further restrict the application of modern slavery safeguards in immigration and asylum cases. This is an extension of the harmful policy of previous Conservative Home Secretaries (Priti Patel/Suella Braverman) introduced via the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the Illegal Migration Act 2023.

The above proposals, and others not listed here, are intended to make the asylum system harsher. This is objectionable for several reasons including:

1. The asylum system ought to focus on identifying refugees as quickly as possible, providing them safety in the UK that is secure, and enabling them to rebuild their lives and integrate well. These proposals do precisely the opposite. They make refugees’ lives extremely uncertain and prolong that uncertainty, and the isolation and marginalisation it causes, for decades.

2. The Government asserts a concern about growing social division, which it identifies in hate and racism directed towards some refugees and other migrants. However, it is giving implicit justification for some of that hate. By creating conditions in which more refugees are liable to face social isolation (including destitution, homelessness, ill-health and exploitation), it is exacerbating division and some of the social ills that enable that to thrive.

3. The Government is making far more work for the Home Office and increasing its costs. It will have to deal with thousands more applications for permission to stay by refugees, who will need to make many more applications and far more frequently. It is also making work and costs for other Government departments. These proposals have serious implications for the legal aid system, the courts, the NHS and local authorities among others. Worse, since the Home Office and courts are already struggling to manage their workloads, it is highly likely that costs will be made far greater by the further dysfunction this additional work will cause.

4. The likely human rights impact is dire. Reducing safeguards and increasing the severity of the asylum system can only increase the dependence of people who seek or receive asylum on human rights laws to protect their most basic needs and interests. In any event, the human, financial and social harms of what is being proposed will not ease tension concerning migration and human rights but rather make this worse. While the Government is formally committed to the European Convention on Human Rights, its current actions and proposals put the future of this country’s participation in this regional human rights agreement at significant risk.",https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/styles/social_share_image/s3/settings/amnesty_logo_0.jpg?VersionId=qA0vtal7uIyyFfzdjtm85CBfSTsi5Vt0&itok=V8GH6KNO,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:48.050563

Make your year-end tax-deductible gift now.

Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, Los Angeles educators have said the increase in immigration enforcement actions contributed to more somber graduation ceremonies, lower attendance and fewer students enrolled in school this year.

Now, a new report from UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access finds similar scenarios are playing out on campuses across the country.

“There can sometimes be a sense that, well, we're facing a set of conditions that are unique to Los Angeles,” said UCLA education professor and report co-author John Rogers. “But every state in the nation, almost every community in the nation has high schools where young people are experiencing fear and concern for themselves and for their family members.”

UCLA researchers based the report on a nationally representative online survey of 606 high school principals and follow-up interviews with about four dozen administrators who said students from immigration families experienced:

Heightened concern: 70% said students from immigrant families were concerned about the well-being of themselves and their families because of policies and political rhetoric related to immigrants.

More absences: 64% said students from immigrant families missed school.

Loss of family members: 58% said immigrant parents and guardians left during the school year, sometimes without their children.

Bullying and harassment: 36% said students from immigrant families have been bullied or harassed at their school, in part because of a “political climate that has normalized attacks on immigrant communities.

LAist has reached out to the Trump administration for comment, but has not yet heard back.

LAUSD immigration resources

Los Angeles Unified School District offers resources for families concerned about immigration through its website.

Families who need assistance regarding immigration, health, wellness, or housing can call LAUSD's Family Hotline: (213) 443-1300

Students’ right to an education

The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that undocumented immigrants have a constitutional right to attend public schools — there are an estimated 39,000 such students enrolled in Los Angeles County.

The number of students with at least one immigrant family member is much greater. For example, almost half of California children have at least one immigrant parent, according to a Public Policy Institute of California analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

How the nation’s principals are handling increased immigration enforcement at schools

On this episode of AirTalk, senior reporter Mariana Dale and UCLA professor John Rogers discuss a new report on a climate of fear in schools around federal immigration policy.

Maria Nichols leads the union that represents Los Angeles Unified School District principals and said that there’s widespread uncertainty among students, families and educators. She is also the daughter of an immigrant from South America who was undocumented for part of her childhood.

“Are we experiencing a crisis now with immigration? Absolutely,” Nichols said. “It's extremely traumatic. It's extremely triggering for people that, you know, lived the immigrant existence. And many of us in education in Los Angeles have lived that.”

More on immigration policy and education

The Reseda high schooler has been in federal immigration detention since August.

More than 4,000 people have been arrested across the region since June and it’s still unclear how the threat of detention may impact whether students show up to school.

Students who started high school wearing face masks and testing for COVID-19 graduate in the midst of widespread immigration raids.

In January, the Trump administration reversed a policy that made schools and other ""sensitive"" locations off limits to immigration enforcement actions. In early June, widespread immigration raids started across Southern California. Most arrested in L.A. and nationwide have no criminal record.

“I think a purpose of the federal immigration enforcement policies is to create a level of stress and uncertainty and fear,” Rogers said. “And precisely those dynamics make it hard to sustain student enrollment and student attendance at high levels.”

Rogers said the current climate can disrupt learning for students who do make it to school.

“The extent to which young people are concerned about their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families while they're at the school means there's less attention, less focus, less learning going on,” Rogers said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08749fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5711x2998+0+421/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F6d%2F971322b64e74b682fdeb3406ac34%2Fimg-7498.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:41.665764

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

The new wave of fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has killed at least 10 people, injured around 20 people, and displaced hundreds of thousands. Fighting near the Gulf of Thailand started today, as the Thai Navy said it had conducted “military operations” to expel Cambodian forces. “We’ve got to do what we’ve got to do,” Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said today, adding, “the government will support all kinds of military operations as planned earlier.” Cambodian President of the Senate Hun Sen said, “Cambodia wants peace, but Cambodia is forced to fight back to defend its territory.” Sui-Lee Wee reports for the New York Times; BBC News reports; Jintamas Saksornchai and Sopheng Cheang report for AP News.

The Southern Transitional Council (STC), a UAE-backed separatist group in Yemen, yesterday claimed broad control across southern Yemen, including the port city of Aden, in a military operation called “Promising Future,” according to senior STC official Amr al-Bidh. Reuters reports.

Israeli authorities yesterday raided a vacant UNRWA compound in East Jerusalem, with the intention of collecting municipal tax debts, the authorities said. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said the compound was not in active use, but that it remains a U.N. location, exempt from search, seizure, or taxation under international law. According to a municipal official, the UNRWA compound lost its exemption from taxation when Israel banned the agency. Ephrat Livni reports for the New York Times.

Lithuania’s government today declared a state of emergency over smuggler balloons originating in Belarus that have disrupted aviation, and asked parliament to allow the military to operate alongside the police and border guards. “The state of emergency is announced not only due to civil aviation disruptions but also due to interests of national security,” Interior Minister Vladislav Kondratovic said. Andrius Sytas reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Ukraine today will share a revised peace plan with the United States comprising 20 points, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters yesterday following talks in London with European allies. “The mood of the Americans, in principle, is for finding compromise,” Zelenskyy said. “Of course there are complex issues related to the territory, and a compromise has not yet been found there.” U.S. and Ukrainian officials say the Trump administration saw Zelensky’s meeting in Downing Street as an unhelpful attempt to buy time in the negotiations over Trump’s peace plan. Olena Harmash and Elizabeth Piper report for Reuters; Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli forces shot and killed a three-year-old girl, Ahed Tareq al-Bayouk, in southern Gaza on Sunday, according to local sources. Ahed al-Bayouk’s death appears to have taken place on the Palestinian side of the Yellow Line. The Israeli Defense Forces said that it was “not aware of a strike” but would “conduct an additional review.” James Cook reports for BBC News.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet President Trump on Dec. 29 to discuss the next steps of the Gaza ceasefire, an Israeli government spokesperson said yesterday. It is unclear where the meeting will take place. Maayan Lubell and Steve Scheer report for Reuters.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been dropped for consideration from Trump’s Board of Peace in Gaza, following objections from several Arab and Muslim states, according to multiple sources. Blair’s office declined to comment on the matter. Another source rejected suggestions that Blair would not be sitting on the board due to opposition in the region, claiming instead that Blair would not qualify for the board because it would be made up of serving world leaders. The source added that Blair is expected to sit on the executive committee alongside U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Andrew England and Neri Zilber report for the Financial Times.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The World Health Organization said yesterday that the death toll from drone strikes last week on a kindergarten and other sites in the Kordofan region is now at 114 people, including 63 children. Fay Abuelgasim reports for AP News.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary said yesterday that it had taken control of the Heglig oil field in the South Kordofan region. Sudanese government forces and workers at the oil field withdrew from the area on Sunday to avoid clashes that could have damaged the oil facilities, government sources told Reuters. Jana Choukeir and Khalid Abdelaziz report.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

U.S. lawmakers have included a provision in the final draft of the National Defense Authorization Act which would withhold a quarter of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if the Pentagon fails to provide the congressional national security committees with a copy of the execute orders behind the strikes on alleged drug vessels and the “unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations.” Leo Shane III, Connor O’Brien, and Joe Gould report for POLITICO; Megan Mineiro reports for the New York Times.

Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to brief the “Gang of Eight” lawmakers this afternoon, according to three sources. The briefing follows the completion of the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy document last week, but lawmakers are also expected to raise questions about the legality of military strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific. Adm. Alvin Holsey, the outgoing head of U.S. Southern Command, is also expected to brief a separate group of Senate and House lawmakers today. Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali, and Daphne Psaledakis report for Reuters; Anne Flaherty, Allison Pecorin, and Mariam Khan report for ABC News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Democratic Republic of the Congo President Felix Tshisekedi yesterday accused Rwanda of violating its commitment to a U.S.-brokered peace deal in a speech to lawmakers. There was no immediate response from Rwanda. A senior Trump administration official said that Trump “has made clear to both sides that implementation is what he will judge, and as he stated, he is expecting immediate results.” Ange Adihe Kasongo reports for Reuters.

Honduran Attorney General Johel Antonio Zelaya Alvarez announced yesterday that he had issued an international arrest warrant for former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was recently pardoned by Trump and released from prison in the United States. Zelaya cited charges of money laundering and fraud connected to a case involving Hernández’s first presidential campaign. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The Justice Department yesterday announced that two businessmen are in custody for allegedly smuggling Nvidia H100 and H200 chips to China. The alleged smuggling network “threatens our Nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” U.S. Attorney Nicholas Ganjei said. Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Trump yesterday announced that the United States would allow Nvidia to “ship its H200 products to approved customers in China…under conditions that allow for continued National Security.” Trump added that “25% will be paid to the United States of America” without giving details of the arrangement. “The Trump administration’s announcement that it will allow the export of advanced H200 AI chips to China is a colossal economic and national security failure,” several senior Democratic senators said in a statement. Demetri Sevastopulo and Michael Action report for the Financial Times.

Trump said yesterday that he would issue an executive order this week to block state laws on AI. Trump did not offer details on the order, but a draft order circulated last month directed the U.S. attorney general to sue states to overturn AI laws and federal regulators were also directed to withhold broadband grants and other funding to states with AI laws. Cecilia Kang reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Certain judges “are engaging in an unconscionable campaign of bias and hostility against U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan,” Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said yesterday after judges in the Eastern District of Virginia criticized Halligan’s continued involvement in court matters. The statement added, “This Department of Justice has no tolerance for undemocratic judicial activism.” April Rubin reports for Axios.

Alina Habba, Trump’s former personal lawyer, yesterday stepped down as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. Habba was disqualified from the role last week after an appeals court found that she was serving unlawfully. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the Justice Department will seek further review of the ruling and is “confident” the decision will be reversed. “Do not mistake compliance for surrender,” Habba wrote on social media. “This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.” Julianna Bragg and April Rubin report for Axios.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said yesterday that he signed an executive order declaring the Council on American-Islamic Relations a foreign terrorist organization. Patricia Mazzei reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday unveiled a $12 billion bailout for farmers at an event at the White House. “We love our farmers,” Trump said. “And, as you know, the farmers like me.” Alan Rappeport, Kevin Draper, and Ana Swanson report for the New York Times.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development yesterday temporarily revoked a policy change that would significantly cut permanent housing funding for people experiencing homelessness, ahead of a court hearing. According to the court filing, HUD’s reasoning for rescinding the policy change was “to assess the issues raised by the Plaintiffs in their suits and to fashion a revised” notice of funding opportunity. “You can change the policy all you want but there’s a mechanism for doing so and it’s not doing things an hour before court,” the Judge said during the hearing yesterday. Katherine Hapgood reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court yesterday appeared likely to allow Trump to remove a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission purely for policy reasons. The court’s conservative majority seemed ready to overturn or limit a landmark decision from 1935, which said Congress could constrain the president’s authority to remove some executive branch officials. Devin Dwyer reports for ABC News.

A federal judge yesterday vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of windfarms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law. AP News reports.

A federal judge yesterday ordered top Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign to testify on Dec 16. about the decision to deport more than a hundred men to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act earlier this year. The judge also ordered testimony on Dec. 15 from Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ attorney who alleged the Trump administration sought to circumvent court orders. Peter Charalambous, Laura Romeo, and Ely Brown report for ABC News.

The creators of ICEBlock, an app on which users can report sightings of ICE agents, filed a lawsuit yesterday against the Trump administration, alleging that it illegally threatened to prosecute the app’s creators and pressured Apple to remove the app from its App Store. Andrew Pantazi reports for Axios

12 anonymous former FBI agents yesterday filed a lawsuit against the FBI and the Justice Department, alleging they were demoted or fired in retaliation for kneeling during a 2020 protest as a de-escalation tactic, conduct that the administration has characterized as participating in the demonstration. Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

In January 2025, Lebanese authorities deported an Egyptian-Turkish poet, Abdulrahman Youssef al-Qardawi, to the UAE on the Emirati authorities’ request, citing charges related to his peaceful activity on social media.","(Beirut) –The detention of an Emirati dissident in Syria raises serious concerns that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will pressure Syrian authorities to extradite him, Human Rights Watch said today.

An informed source told Human Rights Watch that Syrian authorities detained Jasem al-Shamsi, 55, at a checkpoint in the Damascus countryside on November 6, 2025, and have held him since without disclosing the legal basis for his detention. The UAE has pressed Lebanon and Jordan to return dissidents in recent years. If returned, al-Shamsi will be at serious risk of enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, unfair trial, and torture.

“Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Emirati authorities will once again exert pressure on another country in the region to forcibly return a dissident convicted in a sham trial,” said Joey Shea, United Arab Emirates researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Syrian authorities should deny any request to extradite al-Shamsi to the UAE, where he would face enforced disappearance and prolonged arbitrary detention.”

In 2013, Emirati authorities sentenced al-Shamsi in absentia to 10 years in prison as part of the notorious UAE94 unfair mass trial against political dissidents and human rights defenders. He was sentenced to life in prison in absentia for his peaceful advocacy in a second unfair mass trial in July 2024.

In March, Syrian authorities at the Immigration and Passports Department told al-Shamsi that there was an Interpol request for him. Human Rights Watch could not independently confirm whether there is an Interpol request for al-Shamsi. Warrants issued by the Arab Interior Ministers’ Council, a regional body concerned with security issues, are often misleadingly referred to as requests from “Arab Interpol.” These requests have led to the arrest and unlawful extradition of political dissidents and human rights defenders across Arab League countries, including twodissidents who were immediately subject to enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention upon arrival in the UAE.

Al-Shamsi was driving with his wife through the Damascus countryside when Syrian security forces stopped them and asked for identity documents. Security forces detained him and took him to the al-Fayha criminal security center, the informed source said. Security agents searched the family car without presenting a warrant and did not answer questions about the arrest. Syrian authorities have not informed al-Shamsi or his wife of the basis for the arrest.

On November 8, al-Shamsi’s wife returned to al-Fayha security center to ask about her husband, but authorities there denied knowledge of his detention and whereabouts, the source said. Al-Shamsi’s wife visited the Prisons Administration in Damascus on November 12, where authorities confirmed that he was in custody but denied knowledge of his exact whereabouts, the source said. Al-Shamsi was able to contact his family on November 27, when he confirmed that he was in custody and said he was being treated well, the source said.

Emirati authorities have repeatedly pressured countries that are members of the Arab Interior Ministers Council to forcibly return dissidents to the UAE, where they have faced enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture.

In May 2023, Jordanian authorities detained and forcibly extradited to the UAE a dual Emirati-Turkish citizen, Khalaf Abdulrahman al-Romaithi. Emirati authorities forcibly disappeared al-Romaithi upon arrival in the UAE and sentenced him to life in prison in 2024. Al-Romaithi and al-Shamsi were tried together in absentia as part of the notorious UAE94 unfair mass trial in 2013.

In January 2025, Lebanese authorities deported an Egyptian-Turkish poet, Abdulrahman Youssef al-Qardawi, to the UAE on the Emirati authorities’ request, citing charges related to his peaceful activity on social media. Lebanese authorities extradited al-Qardawi to the UAE even though he was not an Emirati citizen, nor was he in the UAE when the alleged offenses were committed.

In December 2023, the Emirati government carried out its second largest mass trial against 84 activists, dissidents, and human rights defenders, including al-Shamsi and al-Romaithi, for forming an independent advocacy group in 2010, a charge many have already served arbitrary prison sentences for as part of the grossly unfair 2013 case.

On November 19, 2025, Ali al-Khaja, one of the defendants in both trials, died in custody in the UAE’s notorious al-Razeen Prison.

Syria is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment or a threat to their life. This principle is codified in the Convention Against Torture, to which Syria is a party, and customary international law.

The latest guidance follows the EEOC’s previous 2016 Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination, which remains in effect.

Title VII, which is enforced by the EEOC, prohibits employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and applies to most private employers with 15 or more employees. Under Title VII, discrimination based on national origin with respect to compensation and other terms and conditions of employment is unlawful, and employers are prohibited from limiting, segregating or classifying employees in a way that could deprive them of opportunities based on their national origin.

The new technical assistance document defines national origin discrimination as “treating employees or applicants unfavorably or favorably because they are from a particular country or part of the world, because of ethnicity or accent, or because they appear to be of a certain ethnic background.”

The landing page emphasizes that Title VII protects all workers, “including Americans,” and explains that national origin discrimination can include preferring foreign workers, including workers with certain visa statuses, over American workers. It further highlights that discrimination can occur when the victim and the person engaging in the discrimination are of the same national origin.

The technical assistance document and landing page provide several examples of fact patterns that might constitute unlawful national origin discrimination, including:

Using discriminatory job advertisements, such as ads that suggest an employer prefers or requires applicants from a particular country or with a particular visa status (e.g., “H-1B preferred” or “H-1B only”);

Terminating employees who are “on the bench” between assignments at a higher rate than employees who are visa guest workers;

Making it more difficult for applicants of one national origin to apply for positions (e.g., subjecting U.S. workers to more laborious application methods than H-1B visa holders during the permanent labor certification (PERM) process);

Paying visa guest workers less than similarly situated American workers; or

Allowing harassment based on national origin, accent, or ethnicity that creates a hostile work environment.

The document also makes clear that the following considerations do not excuse an employer’s decision to hire foreign workers over American workers:

Customer or client preference;

Lower labor costs (whether due to “under the table” payment, or abuse of certain visa-holder wage requirement rules); or

Beliefs that workers of one or more national origin groups are “more productive” or “possess a better work ethic” than others from different groups.

Takeaways

This most recent EEOC guidance builds upon the enforcement priorities previously laid out by the EEOC around “protecting American workers from anti-American national origin discrimination.” Under the leadership of current Chair Andrea Lucas, the EEOC has emphasized protecting American workers from perceived “foreign preference” practices. In February 2025, then-Acting Chair Lucas announced a priority to “rigorously enforce” Title VII against employers that “illegally prefer non-American workers,” and vowed to protect American workers from anti-American bias.

The issue is all the more critical since the Supreme Court issued a temporary order this fall allowing immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to stop civilians without clear cause.","What Happened: A congressional investigation out today has found that, contrary to the Trump administration’s claims, immigration agents have frequently detained and mistreated U.S. citizens.

The report by Senate Democrats, which was prompted by ProPublica’s reporting, included interviews with nearly two dozen Americans.

Citizens told congressional investigators that immigration officers had dragged them from cars, detained them for days, fabricated claims of assault, routinely used excessive force and denied medical care.

The investigation also found that agents “treated children with reckless disregard for their safety and wellbeing.”

One citizen recalled that federal agents pointed guns at her youngest children, ages 6 and 8, and dragged her 14-year-old daughter out of a pickup and zip-tied her.

The citizen, Anabel Romero, told investigators that an agent threatened to “fucking blow your head off” during the chaotic raid at a rural Idaho racetrack. Romero also said agents “wouldn’t let people get diapers or food for their kids.”

Romero and her children were born in Idaho.

Five other citizens are giving their accounts publicly Tuesday on Capitol Hill.

What They Said: The citizens’ accounts paint a dire picture, the senator behind the report told ProPublica in an interview.

“What most struck me is the brutality and physical violence involved in every story,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “This is stuff that should be unrecognizable as America. It should make everyday Americans outraged that their fellow citizens could be treated this way.”

Background: ProPublica reported in October that agents have detained more than 170 Americans this year. More than 20 citizens said they were held for at least a day without being able to contact a lawyer or their loved ones. We also found that nearly 20 American children were detained. Four were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to a lawyer.

Why it Matters: The government does not track the number of Americans wrongly detained by immigration agents. The Trump administration in turn has denied that it happens. “No American citizens have been arrested or detained,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last month.

The citizens’ firsthand accounts in the congressional report show that is not true.

The issue is all the more critical since the Supreme Court issued a temporary order this fall allowing immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to stop civilians without clear cause.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that citizens had no reason to worry. “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

The congressional investigation found that one citizen was actually held for four days.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250919-Maney-Detained-Citizens-104_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-12-09 13:56:58.265310

The Trump administration has challenged ICE bans in other places by asserting those policies discriminate against the federal government.
“We are saying this is about defending city property from anyone,” Mahmood said, noting it will assert the city has a constitutional property right to protect its property and a fearful workforce.","The idea for the legislation, he told Playbook, came after the Trump administration took over city parking lots and other government property in Chicago and elsewhere for immigration enforcement sweeps and troop deployments.

“It was clear we needed something with teeth,” Mahmood said. “A city purpose is not civil immigration enforcement. This is a declaration of our local rights.”

He said his plan would not prevent ICE or other Homeland Security agents from entering city property to conduct targeted arrests — rather, they couldn’t stage operations or have an ongoing presence there. Still, the limitations would apply to large swaths of city-owned property including Golden Gate Park, the City Hall plaza and public transit stations.

There’s little doubt the proposal will draw backlash from the Trump administration, which could reignite tensions that had subsided this fall after Lurie and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, along with other prominent tech powerbrokers, implored Trump to stand down.

Mahmood seems to anticipate the legislation, written by City Attorney David Chiu and co-sponsored by Supervisor Chyanne Chen, will be challenged in court.

Lurie’s office did not respond to a request for comment, though the mayor was briefed on the plan. Lurie has deliberately avoided provoking Trump, a strategy that appears to have contributed to the president’s decision not to target San Francisco as he has Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., New Orleans or Portland.

But San Francisco’s powerful labor unions are lining up in support of Mahmood’s plan, arguing Lurie’s strategy might not work for much longer.

“Anyone who somehow thinks we can fly under the radar with this administration is living in a fantasy world,” said Rudy Gonzalez, head of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents thousands of city workers. “That, to me, is not a sustainable model. This is a very specific thing the city can do that is not performative — is not going to poke the bear, necessarily.”

Mahmood said he believes the plan is “legally defensible” because it applies to any outside government entity, including the state, that attempts to seize city property without permission.

“ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.
Our law officers are facing more than a 1150% increase in assaults against them and an 8000% increase in death threats,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Tuesday in a statement to The Hill.","The creator of ICEBlock — an iPhone app that flagged sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — sued the Trump administration on Monday, arguing Attorney General Pam Bondi violated free speech protections by pressuring Apple to remove the app from its store.

Joshua Aaron, the maker of the app, argues in the complaint that the creation, distribution and promotion of the app is protected by the First Amendment and that the alleged “pressure campaign” by the Trump administration to “to coerce Apple into removing ICEBlock from the App Store” amounts to censorship and is unlawful.

“We’re basically asking the court to set a precedent and affirm that ICEBlock is, in fact, First Amendment-protected speech and that I did nothing wrong by creating it,” Aaron told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. “And to make sure that they can’t do this same thing again in the future.”

The lawsuit also asks a federal judge to protect Aaron from prosecution, challenging the “unlawful threats made by Attorney General Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, and White House Border Czar Tom Homan to criminally investigate and prosecute Aaron for his role in developing ICEBlock.”

He told the AP that one goal of the lawsuit is “to basically have them stop threatening myself and my family.”

Apple removed ICEBlock and other apps in October after Bondi said they put immigration enforcement officials at risk by allowing users of the app to track ICE activity in their neighborhoods.

Bondi, in an interview on Fox News over the summer, said Aaron was putting law enforcement at risk by “giving a message to criminals where our federal officers are. And he cannot do that. And we are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that’s not protected speech.”

“We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store – and Apple did so,” Bondi said in October.

Apple notified Aaron of the decision on the same day, telling the software developer in an email shared with the AP at the time, that new information “provided to Apple by law enforcement” made clear ICEBlock violated the company’s policies.

The email noted that the tracker broke the rules “because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.”

Aaron has pushed back against that argument. In a Monday interview on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront,” the plaintiff said the government used the same argument when GPS apps like Waze rolled out — which shared the location of things like speed traps and relies on public law enforcement reporting.

“Somehow, they figured, if you could see a police officer doing a speed trap in public and you told somebody else about it, magically, they were going to jump out of their car and start smashing the police car and attacking the police officer. Obviously, that’s ridiculous,” Aaron said. “That doesn’t happen. What do they do? They slow down and they avoid the conflict.”

He noted ICEBlock states in three distinct places that the app is “for informational purposes only” and “do not obstruct law enforcement.”

“So, this was never intended to be anything other than an informational tool that allowed people within a five-mile radius of the reported sighting to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to approach the area in which ICE was sighted,” the app creator said.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

On Wednesday this week a Council of Europe meeting will take place at which there is expected to be discussion around “reinterpreting” article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Because of the reporting I have seen around this, and will no doubt see more of this week, I think it is important to note that the government’s stated target is not the “torture” element of article 3 but the “inhuman and degrading treatment” part.

Focussing attention on the part of article 3 which is not at risk is unhelpful. The asylum paper singles out healthcare needs, specifically mental health cases, as being the reason that reform is needed, so it seems to be cases such as MY (Suicide risk after Paposhvili) that the government is seeking to exclude from protection under article 3.

I was very pleased to see the Migration Observatory’s piece on issues with published Home Office data last week. And on that note, as I first identified in August this year and highlighted again in November, we finally have confirmation from the Home Office that the statistics on asylum claims based on sexual orientation are currently not being published, with no firm date for their return. The Home Office is being extremely cagey about the data that is missing because of this systems change (which surely cannot be limited to these cases) and it remains unclear whether it will remain missing once publication resumes. Anyone with questions may want to try here.

On Free Movement, I think today’s post on the vicarious trauma of practitioners is a particularly timely one given the shockwaves that are still reverberating through the migrant community after the recently announced increase to refugee settlement periods and earned settlement proposals. Trying to advise desperately worried people when many of the proposals are vague at best, and without any certainty as to what is going to happen and when and who will actually be affected, does have an impact on lawyers and so please do have a read.

Also on the blog, we now have the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act 2025 after Royal Assent was given last week. I did a quick post on the Home Office writing out to Syrian refugees with pending settlement applications after I could see panic spreading fast last week.

There were a couple of case write ups including this one on sponsor licence revocation and a very useful Court of Appeal decision on the need for the Home Office to exercise flexibility in decision making, in this case in a Windrush application.

The move closely follows a similar order issued in November by Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, DeSantis’s fellow Republican, even though only the federal government can designate terrorist organizations.

Cair and its supporters are among those who have dismissed the orders from DeSantis and Abbott as Islamophobia.

In a statement, the national and Florida Cair chapters described DeSantis’s order as a “stunt” and accused him of signing a “defamatory and unconstitutional order baselessly smearing” them. The groups vowed to sue Florida as it has Texas, where Abbott has directed law enforcement officials to investigate whether a group in Dallas is operating courts under sharia law.

The order said Cair was “founded by persons connected to the Muslim Brotherhood,” which it connects to Hamas and the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Cair denies ties to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Cair’s Florida and national chapters said DeSantis through his order had prioritized “serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida” – and of diverting “millions in Florida taxpayer dollars to the Israeli government’s bonds”.

DeSantis and Abbott, it added, want “to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims”, who criticize the US’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza.

In a separate statement on X, DeSantis said that members of the Florida legislature “are crafting legislation to stop the creep of sharia law, and I hope that they codify these protections for Floridians against Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood in their legislation”.

Abbott’s order in Texas prohibited Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood from acquiring property in the state and authorizing legal action to shut down affiliated entities.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/072b63e4e6d795e403d221e7e81f944b7a7798f5/640_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0049e841cf4a72ff52c38668e38a6d63",N,,2025-12-09 12:57:52.916662

United States

NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union today filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the immediate release of an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion and other documents related to President Trump’s illegal lethal strikes on civilian boats in international waters.

“The public deserves to know how our government is justifying the cold-blooded murder of civilians as lawful and why it believes it can hand out get-out-of-jail-free cards to people committing these crimes,” said Jeffrey Stein, staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project. “The Trump administration must stop these illegal and immoral strikes, and officials who have carried them out must be held accountable.”

Since Sept. 2, the Trump administration has conducted at least 22 strikes, murdering at least 87 civilians, in clear violation of domestic and international law. Indeed, the U.S. military may not, under any circumstances, execute civilians who are merely suspected of smuggling drugs. The federal government must first pursue non-lethal measures like arrest and demonstrate that lethal force is an absolute last resort to protect against a concrete, specific, and imminent threat of death or serious physical injury. Despite bipartisan outrage over these plainly unlawful attacks, the Trump administration has said they will continue.

The groups are suing to force the disclosure of a legal opinion authored by OLC — a part of the Justice Department whose opinions are generally treated as binding within the executive branch — that apparently blesses the ongoing strikes as lawful acts in an alleged “armed conflict” with unspecified “drug cartels.” According to news accounts, the memo also purports to immunize personnel who authorized or took part in these unlawful strikes from future criminal prosecution for what would otherwise simply be homicides.

Contrary to the government’s public assertions, the United States is not, and could not be, in an armed conflict with Latin American drug cartels. Under international law, an armed conflict between a state and a non-state actor exists only if the non-state actor is an “organized armed group” that is structured and disciplined like regular armed forces and is engaged in “protracted armed violence” against the state. There is no plausible argument that any drug cartel satisfies this test vis-a-vis the United States.

“The Trump administration is displacing the fundamental mandates of international law with the phony wartime rhetoric of a basic autocrat,” said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. “If the OLC opinion seeks to dress up legalese in order to provide cover for the obvious illegality of these serial homicides, the public needs to see this analysis and ultimately hold accountable all those who facilitate murder in the United States’ name.”

The Trump administration has repeatedly acknowledged the existence of the memo and continues to assert that their strikes are on “firm legal ground,” yet they are still refusing to publicly release the OLC opinion that details their reasoning. In mid-November, the Trump administration allowed members of Congress and their staffs to read the opinion. Many found its analysis deeply troubling. Indeed, one senator remarked that the opinion “would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world. I mean, it is broad enough to authorize just about anything.”

“The public deserves to know how the Trump administration is rubber-stamping the bombing of civilians in the Caribbean Sea, with no accountability,” said Ify Chikezie, staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “By claiming that these attacks are legal while refusing to provide any evidence or rationale, Trump shows once again his disdain for basic transparency, human rights, and the rule of law. The courts must step in and order the administration to release these documents immediately.”

The groups are asking the court to intervene because the government has not released any records in response to their request, despite urgent public interest in the OLC opinion and the Freedom of Information Act’s (FOIA) clear statutory deadlines.

FOIA Case Seeking the Trump Administration’s Legal Justification for Deadly Boat Strikes

The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC”) authored a legal opinion that reportedly claims to justify the Trump administration’s illegal lethal strikes on civilians in boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. Media reports indicate that, in addition to claiming that the strikes are lawful acts in an alleged “armed conflict” with unspecified drug cartels, the OLC opinion also purports to immunize personnel who authorized or took part in the strikes from future criminal prosecution. Because the public deserves to know how our government is justifying these illegal strikes, and why they think the people who carried them out should not be held accountable, the ACLU is seeking immediate release of the OLC legal opinion and related documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.

I’m grateful to Representatives Jayapal and Smith for introducing this bill which establishes crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections that this administration has systematically dismantled.”

Since President Trump returned to office, the use of immigration detention has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, with over 66,000 people detained. During that period of time, 23 people have died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Nearly 73 percent of those detained have no criminal convictions, and many of those with convictions have only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

Detained people in these facilities are being held in inhumane living conditions, with reports of overcrowding forcing 35 men to share one toilet and sleep head to toe on concrete floors, of people being served only a cup of rice a day or rotting food, and of people having their medications withheld or being denied necessary medical care. Further, the Trump Administration has restarted the practice of detaining families and children, which has long been criticized as unsafe and inflicting irreversible harm on children.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would:

Repeal mandatory detention;

Prohibit the detention of families and children in family detention;

Create a presumption of release and impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, survivors of torture or gender-based violence, people with serious mental or physical illness or disability, LGBTQ individuals, asylum seekers, and people over the age of 60;

Phase out the use of private detention facilities and jails over a three-year period;

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards that provide, at minimum, the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards;

Mandate the DHS Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections with meaningful penalties for failure to comply with standards; and

Require DHS to admit Members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

This contribution identifies where such guidance can help, and where a significant shift in current State practice is needed: clear legal basis and safeguards for intrusive practices, data sharing and interoperability, oversight of algorithmic systems, human rights impact assessment, and the use of security and emergency regimes that dilute rights protections. Each area is framed by the need to ensure legality, necessity and proportionality, non-discrimination, and effective remedy.

Why the new guidance?

Under instruction from the UN Secretary-General, OHCHR was requested to draft Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights-Based Digital Border Governance (hereafter: “guidance”). The initiative builds on a report on the same topic produced by OHCHR and Essex University in 2023. Key issues addressed by the guidance include: (i) biometrics and large databases, (ii) risk screening and profiling, (iii) automated and AI-assisted decision-making, (iv) intra- and inter-state data sharing, and (v) private-sector participation. While the guidance will not be binding on States, it draws on best practice including developments in data protection law and AI regulation. OHCHR also benefited from the mapping conducted by the AFAR project and consultation on the draft with the AFAR team.

Legal basis and safeguards

IHRL requires a clear, accessible, and foreseeable legal basis for interferences with rights, together with appropriate safeguards. Some human rights are absolute, and their violation can never be justified. In the migration context, such rights include non-refoulement and the prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, and the prohibition of collective expulsion. There is no possible justificatory legal basis for the use of technology that enables such violations. Qualified rights may be subject to justifiable limitations, provided they are necessary, proportionate and based in law.

The deployment of digital border governance technologies often limits the rights of people on the move but the lawful basis is not always clearly established. Border and migration authorities often rely on broad enabling statutes or controller authority for data processing, which is insufficient where intrusive measures are used. Mobile phone extraction is a paradigmatic example: blanket seizure and compelled disclosure of credentials are highly intrusive and demand strict necessity, targeted authorisation, and independent oversight. Courts have begun to restrict indiscriminate practices.

Data sharing and interoperability

The systematic sharing of migration-related data within and between states, and with private actors, is another area of concern. Such practices raise serious risks that key privacy safeguards will be eroded, in particular purpose limitation and proportionality. Interoperability demands greater attention to these safeguards. Opening disparate systems to cross-searches or automated matching enhances surveillance capability and facilitates repurposing. Human rights safeguards must travel with the data, including transfer controls, audit trails, and effective access, rectification, and redress. However, binding agreements regulating transfers appear the exception rather than the rule.

Automated systems and meaningful review

The draft guidance also addresses the growing use of automated decision-making (ADM) and AI in digital border governance (see other articles in this collection). While data protection law and emerging AI regulations contain important safeguards, including the right of individuals not to be subject to ADM producing significant legal effect on an individual, this leaves a significant lacuna – insofar as AI may be used in multiple processes that support decision-making and impact human rights (for example through documentary or behavioural analysis which produces recommendations but does not constitute ADM in law). This exacerbates concerns about the implementation of the ‘human in the loop’ principle, the veracity of human review of ADM, and the extent to which these requirements will provide meaningful oversight (rather than a “rubber stamp”). (See EDPS–FRA Joint Opinion (2021); UNGA Special Rapporteur (A/75/590, 2020); UNHCR, Discussion Paper (2021); CoE CAHAI(2020)23, 2020; EU FRA Getting the Future Right)

OHCHR has called for moratoria on the deployment of AI use cases that present unacceptable human rights risks, and the EU AI Act introduces some prohibitions. Nevertheless, the private sector continues to devise high-risk uses cases and AI regulation remains uneven or absent in much of the world. The guidelines affirm that AI systems that cannot demonstrably mitigate risks and ensure compliance with IHRL should not be deployed.

Risk assessments matter

To address this challenge, the guidance urges States to undertake comprehensive risk assessments to identify and mitigate human rights risks arising from the deployment of digital border governance technologies. This reflects the growing use of risk assessments across of a range of complex policy domains, from environmental impact to AI. Specifically, the guidance recommends the systematic use of human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), supplemented where necessary by privacy/data protection impact assessments (PIAs/DPIAs, which are legal requirement for high-risk processing operations in many jurisdictions), and algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs), which are required or recommended where AI is developed by public authorities.

While these assessment tools offer distinct frameworks for identifying and mitigating the risks they address their methodologies overlap, suggesting significant (though largely unexplored) scope for consolidation. This could remove the need for duplication where multiple assessments of the same digital border governance systems are required by law or recommended as best practice.

Currently, HRIAs appear vastly underutilised in respect to digital border governance initiatives. Indeed, beyond the “fundamental rights implications” annexed to a handful of European Commission impact assessments, evidence of HRIAs in this area is vanishingly thin. Concern at such a low bar is exacerbated by the challenges that HRIAs present: they are complex and highly technical, requiring in-depth research and analysis, specialist expertise, extensive stakeholder consultations, and commensurate resourcing. There is also a surprising lack of authoritative guidance on how to conduct HRIAs beyond the Danish Institute for Human Rights’ widely respected toolkit for HRIA of digital activities – which amounts to 261 pages. While States are inevitably keen to simplify assessment processes, shortcuts and checklists risk undermining the value and validity of the exercise, particularly the requisite necessity and proportionality tests.

Given the current lack of transparency in digital border governance and the lack of alternative means to comprehensively address and mitigate the adverse human rights impact of new technologies prior to their deployment, political commitment and considerable resources are needed to ensure that States do conduct HRIAs, that those assessments are rigorous and comprehensive, and that the findings determine not just how the technology is deployed, but if it should be used at all.

Security and emergency regimes

Finally, attempts to institutionalise human rights-based approaches risk frustration by the invocation of regimes that place limits on the application of IHRL. Since the ‘9/11’ terrorist attacks, States have increasingly asserted that migration and border control is a national security issue. This conjunction has had significant effects, framing people on the move as an implicit security threat resulting in the differential and harmful treatment of “suspect communities”. After 9/11, States invoked concern with terrorism as a justification for the detention and expulsion of third country (and even dual) nationals. More recently, these practices have been supplanted by the systematic national security screening of asylum-seekers, applicants for visas and residence permits, and international travellers whose entry into many countries now requires pre-authorisation. This is a remarkable shift whose underlying assumption is that “all travellers are put under surveillance and are considered a priori as potential law breakers”. The ensuing screening systems, now required under a Chapter VII UN Security Council Resolution 2396, incorporate various methods impacting human rights: the collection and analysis of a wide range of data points, the transnational pooling of national security “watchlists”, the inclusion of protected characteristics in risk profiles, and the use of AI and automated decision-making to determine the risk posed by specific individuals. All of this raises important questions about necessity, proportionality, non-discrimination, procedural fairness and access to remedies.

The blurring of the boundaries between administrative immigration procedures and national security has also resulted in broad exemptions to legal frameworks that should protect the rights of people on the move and facilitate public scrutiny of State practices. Most data protection regimes exempt data processed for national security purposes. The EU AI Act fully exempts AI systems used for national security purposes and limits transparency requirements for those systems used for migration and border control. This will likely undermine attempts by civil society and human rights bodies to hold operators and systems to account, and may hamper the work of regulators with a formal oversight mandate.

An increase in the use of emergency powers by States to counter so-called “mass influxes” of migrants may have the same effect. In recent years, at least 11 countries across the Americas, southern and eastern Europe have declared national or localised states of emergency (or similar crisis regimes) for this purpose.

These have seen military forces deployed to support border authorities; restrictions on asylum rights; fast-track detention and expulsion; broader powers to conduct identity checks and search-and-seizure; the expanded use of surveillance drones and biometric systems; and the restriction of public and media access to border areas.

While States assert that the use of emergency powers is strictly required by the exigencies of the situation (and thus in accordance with IHRL) the suspension of constitutional and human rights, due process and oversight is fundamentally at odds with human-rights based approaches. The expansion and repeated renewal of emergency migration decrees by States risks the normalisation of extended containment and the implementation of unaccountable digital border governance regimes, whose deployment may be fast-tracked in the absence of scrutiny or safeguards. The guidance reminds States that national security should not be used as a pretext for vague or arbitrary limitations on human rights.

Where next?

OHCHR’s guidance clarifies baseline human rights requirements for the deployment of digital border governance technologies. At a minimum, States should conduct comprehensive, pre-deployment HRIAs, enhance transparency, institute oversight mechanisms capable of addressing the inherent risk of new technologies, and provide meaningful forms of redress. Without this recalibration, enhanced digital border governance continues to represent a huge risk to vulnerable and marginalised communities.",https://verfassungsblog.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/feature_vb.png,N,,2025-12-09 11:58:14.107256

Former justice department employees sound alarm over 'near destruction' of civil rights division

Sam Levine

More than 200 former employees in the justice department’s civil rights division signed a letter released on Tuesday decrying the “near destruction” of the agency that is supposed to enforce America’s civil rights laws and accused political leadership of waging a campaign to purge career experts from its ranks.

There was a mass exodus of lawyers earlier this year after political appointees removed career managers, detailed employees to menial work unilaterally dropped cases, and made it clear the division’s focus would be enforcing Donald Trump’s priorities. By 1 May of this year, the department had lost about 70% of its attorneys – a staggering number. The letter was released on Tuesday to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the founding of the civil rights division.

Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally who leads the civil rights division, has cheered the departures of career employees, describing them as activists who did not want to do the work that was asked of them. “That could not be further from the truth. We left because this Administration turned the Division’s core mission upside down, largely abandoning its duty to protect civil rights,” the letter says. “Having no use for the expertise of career staff, the Administration launched a coordinated effort to drive us out.”

The letter goes on to detail how the division has abandoned civil rights enforcement, including dismissing key cases involving voting rights, sexual abuse of unaccompanied migrant children, and multiple consent decrees involving police departments across the country. Dhillon also encouraged lawyers to leave and accept a paid leave offer and threatened to lay employees off if they did not, the letter says. Justice department officials appeared caught off guard by how many people were leaving earlier this year and quietly asked employees to reconsider leaving.

“America deserves better,” the letter says. “The future of the Civil Rights Division is in jeopardy, and with it, the rights it protects. We hope that one day we can return the Division to its righteous work. Until then, we will continue to defend those rights and the Constitution wherever we find ourselves. We call on all Americans to join us. Demand that the Division enforce our civil rights laws and defend the Constitution’s promise of equal justice for all.”

Supreme court hears arguments in case challenging campaign finance limitations from political parties

Happening now at the supreme court, arguments in a case that challenges the limits on campaign finance contributions from party committees.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v Federal Election Commission, the challengers (in this case the Senate committee focused on electing GOP members to Congress) argue that the cap on coordinated spending –violates the first amendment, and a party’s ability to sufficiently support a candidate. Depending on the scope of the decision, if the challengers are successful, a party group could spend an unlimited amount of money taking out ads during an election.

Defending the FEC today in court is the high-profile Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, with support from the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

Federal judge grants DoJ request to unseal Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury documents

A federal judge in New York has granted the justice department’s request to unseal grand jury documents in the sex-trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell – the companion and accomplice of the late sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein. It comes after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Donald Trump signed last month.

The legislation requires the Department of Justice to release the full tranche of records related to disgraced financier, in a searchable format by 19 December.

In his order today, judge Paul A Engelmayer also granted the DoJ’s request to release discovery material – which could comprise thousands of documents and exhibits. However, Engelmayer stipulated that the justice department would still be required to abide by a protective order to “withhold or redact segregable portions that contain personally identifiable and other victim-related information”.

A reminder that Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein’s sex-trafficking crimes in a minimum security facility in Texas. In October, the supreme court rejected her petition to overturn her conviction.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest out of Europe on our dedicated live blog today. In his interview with Politico, Donald Trump dismissed EU leaders as “weak” and labelled Europe as a “decaying group of nations”.

Trump also said he didn’t have much hopes about European involvement in Ukraine peace talks, as “they talk, but they don’t produce, and the war just keeps going on and on.”

Jakub notes that “these comments will do nothing to reassure European leaders concerned about the anti-EU outbursts over the weekend coming from the American right.”

While these comments are, in many ways, more of the same from the president, the timing is certainly significant.

“For him [Trump] to repeat all these lines with some pride as he gets named by Politico as ‘the most powerful person shaping Europe’ at the same time as European leaders want – or, more accurately, really need – to stay close to him on Ukraine … it makes it all very complicated for everyone involved,” Jakub writes.

Donald Trump will travel to Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, today for a rally-style event to push out his administration’s affordability messaging.

As we reported earlier, the president touted the state of the US economy under his leadership in an interview with Politico. We can expect more of the same lines at his event today, in a county that swung for Trump in 2024, after voting for the Democratic candidate in several prior presidential elections.

Before Trump heads to Pennsylvania, he’ll attend vice-president JD Vance’s Christmas reception.

Trump concluded his interview with Politico with some musings on the future leadership of the Republican party. Asked if anyone in the party could energise such a wide coalition as he had, Trump said:

I hope so. I don’t know. You never know until they’re tested. You know, it’s like, uh, you jump in the water; you can swim or you can’t.

Hegseth can testify before Congress over 2 September boat strike 'if he wants', Trump says

In his interview with Politico published on Tuesday morning, Trump was asked if the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, should testify under oath before Congress about a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat on 2 September.

“He can if he wants,” Trump said, adding: “I don’t care. I would say do it if you want, Pete.”

Trump said he had seen the video of the strikes. Asked if he thought the second strike was necessary, he said:

Uh, well, it looked like they were trying to turn back over the boat, but I don’t get involved in that. That’s up to them.

Trump claimed that each strike on an alleged drug boat saved the lives of 25,000 Americans, a figure that has been strongly questioned by public health experts.

He added:

And we’re gonna hit ’em on land very soon, too.

Trump grades US economy as ‘A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus’

Asked by Politico to grade the US economy, Trump first rated it as “A-plus”, before upgrading it to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”. Questioned over the cost of living for voters, Trump said he “inherited a total mess”, and added: “Prices were at an all-time high when I came in. Prices are coming down substantially … It’s been 10 months. It’s amazing what we’ve done.”

Asked if he would rule out reducing tariffs on any more goods, Trump said:

“On some. And on some I’ll increase tariffs. Because you know what happens is because of tariffs, all of the car companies are coming back.”

You know, we lost 58% of the automobile business. We a monopoly in the world. We had everything. And because we had presidents that either weren’t smart or didn’t have business sense or their people didn’t do a good job ... they could’ve kept that.

Trump also spoke about the computer chip industry, after yesterday’s decision to allow Nvidia to sell some of its chips to China.

“We could’ve kept the chip market. We had 100% of the chip market, Intel, all of these guys. You know, there’s the thing. They came in to see me, Intel. They needed something to be done by the government. I said, I’m gonna do it, but I think you have to give us 10% of your company. You know what happened? We made $40bn on that deal. The price went through the roof. The United States ... in about 10 minutes, I made $40bn. Nobody talks about that.”

Nvidia shares boosted by Trump’s announcement of chip sales to China

Nvidia shares rose 1.7% in US pre-market trading on Tuesday after Trump said he would allow the sale of its H200 chips to approved Chinese customers. The US president announced on Monday that he had granted Nvidia permission to ship H200 chips to China in exchange for a 25% surcharge for the US, a move that could allow the world’s most valuable company to win back billions of dollars in lost business.

China’s tech stocks slipped slightly after Trump’s announcement. China’s SSE Star Chip index dropped by 1% at the start of trading, before recovering slightly to a 0.43% fall. China’s CSI semiconductor industry index had a similar drop, before recovering to a 0.36% fall.

Last night, Trump insisted that Nvidia’s most powerful AI chips wouldn’t be sold to China, posting on Truth Social:

Nvidia’s US Customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal.

My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Trump’s move was criticized by some senior Democratic senators, including Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons — the top two Democrats on the Senate foreign relations committee — Jack Reed, the Democratic head of the Senate armed services committee, and Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate banking committee.

They, and other Democratic senators, urged Trump to reverse the decision, saying:

“The Trump administration’s announcement that it will allow the export of advanced H200 AI chips to China is a colossal economic and national security failure. The H200s are vastly more capable than anything China can make and gifting them to Beijing would squander America’s primary advantage in the AI race.”

More from that Politico interview with Donald Trump published this morning: Trump told the politics site that he would expect his pick for chair of the Federal Reserve to support an immediate cut to interest rates.

Trump has not yet chosen a new Fed chair, but has been putting pressure on the current chief, Jerome Powell, to cut rates.

Asked if the new chair should lower rates immediately, Trump said:

This guy [Powell] should too. But I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump. But the reason he doesn’t like Trump ... is because I hit him hard because he’s doing a bad job.”

Trump says only ‘dark and sinister forces’ would want his tariffs to end

Donald Trump has defended his tariff regime as he prepares to give a speech on the US economy and cost of living at a rally in Pennsylvania this evening.

Posting on his social media platform Truth Social in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Trump wrote:

Because of Tariffs, easily and quickly applied, our National Security has been greatly enhanced, and we have become the financially strongest Country, by far, anywhere in the World. Only dark and sinister forces would want to see that end!!!

Supreme court justices are due to make a ruling on Trump’s tariffs soon, having heard oral arguments on their legal validity last month. The ruling is expected by the end of this year or early 2026.

In a second post, Trump wrote:

The biggest threat in history to United States National Security would be a negative decision on Tariffs by the U.S. Supreme Court. We would be financially defenseless. Now Europe is going to Tariffs against China, as they already do against others. We would not be allowed to do what others already do!

On Monday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that he had told Beijing that if China did not reduce its “unsustainable” trade deficit with EU, then Europeans would be forced to take measures such as imposing tariffs on Chinese products.

On Tuesday, the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, said that “mutually destructive consequences of tariffs have become increasingly evident” over the course of this year, though he did not mention Donald Trump by name.

Hegseth and Rubio expected to brief 'Gang of Eight'

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Dan Caine, are expected to brief the “Gang of Eight” lawmakers on Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reports, citing two sources familiar with the plan and a Trump administration official.

The “Gang of Eight” – which includes intelligence committee and Senate and House of Representatives leaders from both parties – is traditionally briefed on major national security actions.

The sources did not discuss the nature of the briefing, expected to take place at 3:30pm ET.

Tensions have been mounting between the US and Venezuela, as Donald Trump threatens land strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers, after more than three months of a military campaign against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. On Tuesday, Politico published an interview with the president in which he refused to rule out putting US troops into Venezuela. “I don’t comment on that. I wouldn’t say that one way or the other,” he said.

Asked if he would consider adopting a similar strategy to that taken with Venezuela against Mexico and Colombia, Trump replied: “Yeah, I would. Sure. I would.”

The US military has also built up the presence of warships in the Caribbean, including an aircraft carrier strike group and a nuclear submarine.

Adm Alvin Holsey, the outgoing commander of the US military’s southern command, which oversees American troops in Latin America, is also expected to brief a separate group of House and Senate lawmakers on Tuesday, two people familiar with the matter said.

Holsey will step down on Friday, less than two months after the surprise announcement of his early retirement, which came just over a month into the Pentagon’s accelerating campaign against suspected drug boats. The strikes have resulted in the deaths of nearly 90 people and raised concerns among Democrats and legal experts.

Trump’s military operations have been under increased scrutiny since a 2 September decision to launch a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean.

The video of the attack, viewed by lawmakers last week, showed two men clinging to wreckage after their vessel was destroyed in the first strike, according to sources familiar with the imagery. They were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible communications equipment.

The defense department’s Law of War Manual forbids attacks on combatants who are incapacitated, unconscious or shipwrecked, as long as they abstain from hostilities and do not attempt to escape. The manual cites firing upon shipwreck survivors as an example of a “clearly illegal” order that should be refused.

On Monday, Trump said he would let Hegseth decide whether to release the full video of the strike, in a shift from comments last week when he said the government would “certainly release” any footage, “no problem”.

“Whatever Hegseth wants to do is OK with me,” Trump said on Monday.

The annual defense policy bill currently passing through Congress includes provisions that would compel the Pentagon to provide Congressional committees with unedited video of the strikes. Lawmakers in Congress have tried in recent months to compel Hegseth’s department to share more information about the attacks. The bill would withhold a quarter of the Pentagon’s travel funds if the footage is not shared.

“It would be nice if he would read it,” Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump suggested that a Russian victory would be inevitable, in part because the country is much larger than Ukraine.
As for President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, whom the Trump administration has labeled the head of a terrorist organization: “His days are numbered,” Mr. Trump said, according to the interview transcript.
Eliminating the limits, the majority concluded, could allow wealthy donors to circumvent federal limits on contributions to individual candidates.","Once appointed to the job, Ms. Halligan quickly secured indictments of both, but a federal judge dismissed those indictments on procedural grounds in November, ruling that the Trump administration had violated the law for filling vacancies for federal positions.

Still, Ms. Halligan remains listed as the U.S. attorney on court filings, drawing the attention of judges and magistrate judges in recent days.

During the hearing on Tuesday, the judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, pressed a federal prosecutor to explain why Ms. Halligan’s name remained on such filings, despite the court ruling last month. The judge noted that the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, who was appointed in a similarly unorthodox manner and was similarly found by the courts to be serving unlawfully, had resigned on Monday.

“That’s the proper position, in my view,” Judge Brinkema said. The judge also questioned whether there was any legal guidance issued by the Justice Department to explain why Ms. Halligan was still in the job.

The lawyer representing the government said only that the staff of the Eastern District of Virginia had been told in an email to keep using Ms. Halligan’s name as the U.S. attorney.

Inside the Justice Department, officials have asked the Office of Legal Counsel for guidance because the office provides legal analysis for the administration, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.

The office has advised department officials that Ms. Halligan could stay in spite of a judge’s ruling declaring her appointment invalid because the decision did not require a specific measure to be taken, like her removal, the people said.

The motion seeking the unsealing of the records was made last month by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had asked the judge to expedite a ruling given the upcoming deadline set by the law, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Ms. Bondi had also asked a different judge to unseal the grand jury materials from the investigation of Mr. Epstein, who was indicted on sex-trafficking charges in July 2019 and detained pending trial; he was found dead in his jail cell the following month, and his death was ruled a suicide.

The judge in Mr. Epstein’s case, Richard M. Berman, has not yet ruled on that request.

This past summer, Judge Engelmayer and Judge Berman each denied similar requests by Ms. Bondi for the Maxwell and Epstein materials, citing grand jury secrecy. Ms. Bondi renewed her request to both judges for the materials after the new law passed last month.

The request, submitted by Ms. Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, was signed by Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The motion argues that the new law demonstrates a congressional intent “to override some of the underlying bases for grand jury secrecy.”

The motion notes, for example, that one purpose of the secrecy rule is to protect people who have not been charged “from the anxiety, embarrassment and public castigation that may result from disclosure.”

The new law mandates that materials may not be “withheld, delayed or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, political sensitivity, including to any governmental official, public figure or foreign dignitary,” the motion says.

The new law also allows for withholding certain information like records that could identify victims or contain personal medical information, or that could jeopardize an active federal investigation, the motion noted.

Ms. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 after a monthlong trial of sex-trafficking conspiracy, sex trafficking of a minor and other counts.

A federal judge in the Southern District of Florida on Friday granted the Justice Department’s request to unseal grand jury materials from an investigation there of Mr. Epstein that began in 2005 into allegations he was abusing teenage girls. As part of a deal to avoid federal charges, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges that included soliciting minors for prostitution, a deal that has been harshly criticized as overly lenient.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Mr. Trump said that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has rejected parts of a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire, would have to “get on the ball” and start “accepting things.” Mr. Zelensky’s army is losing the war, Mr. Trump said, suggesting that it was time for him to compromise in the cease-fire talks.

Mr. Trump’s intervention was published a day after the leaders of Britain, France and Germany met with Mr. Zelensky in London to show their support for Ukraine and discuss alternative cease-fire plans. Mr. Zelensky reiterated after that meeting that Ukraine would not budge from its longstanding opposition to handing over land to Russia, a requirement of Mr. Trump’s proposed peace plan.

Mr. Trump also accused Mr. Zelensky of not having read a new draft of the American peace plan. “It would be nice if he would read it,” Mr. Trump said. “You know, a lot of people are dying. So it would be really good if he’d read it.”

Several elements of the American peace plan — which was published last month — echoed demands made by the Kremlin, prompting alarm across Europe.

Mr. Trump suggested that a Russian victory would be inevitable, in part because the country is much larger than Ukraine.

Russia, he said, has the “upper hand. And they always did. They’re much bigger. They’re much stronger,” Mr. Trump said. Even though he said that he gave Ukraine a lot of credit for bravery, “At some point, size will win.”

Mr. Trump called for elections in Ukraine, accusing the country’s leadership of “using war not to hold an election.”

“They talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy anymore,” he said.

Mr. Trump also would not rule out an American ground invasion of Venezuela, which he has repeatedly threatened with military action inside the country and accused of sending drugs and criminals to the United States. As for President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, whom the Trump administration has labeled the head of a terrorist organization: “His days are numbered,” Mr. Trump said, according to the interview transcript.

Later, Mr. Trump said he had watched footage of the Sept. 2 military strike on a boat in the Caribbean that killed survivors of a previous attack on the boat, which the administration has said was involved in drug trafficking. “It’s not pretty,” Mr. Trump said. Lawmakers in Congress have been debating whether the second strike was a war crime.

“Nobody wants to drive boats to America loaded up with drugs anymore,” Trump said. “And we’re gonna hit ’em on land very soon, too.”

The court has been chipping away at campaign finance restrictions ever since. The case the justices will consider on Tuesday involves one of the remaining limits: how much money political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.

The case, National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, was brought by national Republican leaders, who argue that the limits violate the First Amendment, restricting their ability to reach and influence voters.

Depending on its scope, such a decision could swing the pendulum of power back toward the official political parties and away from super PACs. It could also allow parties to spend huge sums from big donors directly on candidates, potentially expanding the influence of big money compared with small-dollar contributions. Democrats in recent years have done better than Republicans at winning smaller donations.

In practical terms, a win for the Republicans could have an immediate impact on the midterm elections, shrinking one of the Democratic Party’s major financial advantages: lower costs for political candidates who directly buy broadcast advertising time.

Under federal law, broadcasters must offer political candidates low advertising rates. But they are not required to give super PACs those same low rates. Super PACs often pay double, triple and even four times as much money for the same TV spots as do candidates.

In recent years, Democratic candidates have tended to vastly out-raise Republican candidates, who have been more reliant on the support of super PACs and national party committees, which can accept larger donations. In practice, that means Democratic candidates have been able to take advantage of these lower ad rates more often than Republicans.

A ruling in the case is expected by July. If the court decides to allow unlimited spending by the parties in coordination with the candidates, party committees will suddenly also be guaranteed those cheaper rates — an outcome that campaign finance experts say would probably especially benefit Republicans and potentially save the G.O.P. tens of millions of dollars next fall.

While an individual donor can give only $3,500 to a candidate during an election cycle, a donor can give up to $44,300 to a national party committee’s general fund each year and hundreds of thousands more to specialty accounts. If the Supreme Court lifts limits on party committees to coordinate with candidates, the parties could use the large contributions they raise from wealthy donors to pay for low ad rates.

The ad price disparity is so big that Republicans have been testing various other ways to skirt the existing law while this challenge has been winding its way through the courts.

In 2026, the committees of both national parties that are focused on the House and Senate races will probably be financially closely matched. But the Republican National Committee itself has an edge over the Democratic National Committee, with far more cash on hand, about $91 million. The D.N.C. recently had only $18 million on hand after taking out a $15 million loan.

Democrats would probably make it a huge priority to raise money for the party committees should Republicans win at the court, potentially making a G.O.P. advantage short-lived.

The dispute before the Supreme Court began on Nov. 4, 2022, when national Republican leaders and two Ohio political candidates, including Vice President JD Vance, who was then running for the Senate, sued the Federal Election Commission.

The challengers argued that federal campaign finance laws unfairly limited political party committees “from doing what the First Amendment entitles them to do: fully associate with and advocate for their own candidates for federal office.”

The commission regularly updates limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates for each election cycle. According to court documents in the case, in the 2021-22 election cycle, the National Republican Senatorial Committee spent roughly $15.5 million on coordinated party expenditures with Republican Senate nominees, and the National Republican Congressional Committee spent roughly $8.3 million on coordinated party expenditures with Republican House nominees. These expenditures primarily funded political advertising.

Such spending limits between party committees and candidates were established in 1974 in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and had been previously upheld by the Supreme Court in 2001 in a case brought by Colorado Republicans.

In that case, the justices found in a 5-to-4 decision that limits on spending were necessary. Eliminating the limits, the majority concluded, could allow wealthy donors to circumvent federal limits on contributions to individual candidates.

The limits are strict — a total of $7,000 for a federal candidate every two years. Super PACs, however, face no limits at all so long as they advertise independently of the candidates they are supporting.

The case now before the Supreme Court was previously heard by a panel of 16 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, a process called en banc review.

The challengers argued that the law and facts on the ground had changed since the Supreme Court’s 2001 decision, making it no longer binding on lower courts. They pointed to subsequent decisions by the Supreme Court tightening free-speech restrictions on campaign finance regulations.

In September 2024, the divided federal appeals court rejected that argument and upheld the legality of the regulation. In an opinion written by Jeffrey S. Sutton, the chief judge of the circuit and an appointee of President George W. Bush, the court held that “the key reality” was that “the Supreme Court has not overruled the 2001 Colorado decision.”

Judge Sutton noted that the court’s more recent rulings in other cases suggested a view that limiting money in politics violated the First Amendment, but said that lower courts did not have the authority to overrule Supreme Court precedent.

“A political party exists to get its candidates elected,” lawyers for the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote in a brief asking the justices to weigh in, adding that “Congress has severely restricted how much parties can spend on their own campaign advertising if done in cooperation with those very candidates.”

The Biden administration had defended the regulation in court. But by the time the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, President Trump had been re-elected. The Trump administration flipped sides and refused to defend the campaign spending limits. At that point, the court appointed a veteran Supreme Court litigator, Roman Martinez, to argue on behalf of the current law. The justices will also hear from lawyers for Democratic organizations, who intervened in the case and support the finance limits.

In a brief, lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and other groups argued that the case was not about the First Amendment but instead about “whether the Constitution guarantees parties an unlimited right — unique among political bodies — to subsidize the campaign expenses of federal candidates.” They added, “It does not.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/09/multimedia/09trump-news-promo2/09trump-news-promo2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:27.490148

The Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to proceed with deportation flights despite that directive, prompting scrutiny of former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni, who alleges officials discussed ignoring court orders, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign, who reportedly conveyed the judge’s instructions.

The decision marks the latest development in a long-running legal clash over the government’s use of a rarely deployed wartime statute and the subsequent handling of migrant flights to El Salvador.

Why It Matters

At the center of the escalating court fight is a fundamental test of presidential power and judicial authority: whether the Trump administration can invoke a centuries-old wartime statute to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants—and whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defied a federal judge’s order to stop those removals.

The outcome will determine not only the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for immigration enforcement but also the limits of due-process protections for people on U.S. soil and the courts’ ability to enforce their directives in real time.

What To Know

Origins of the Legal Challenge

The underlying litigation stems from a class-action complaint filed in March 2025 on behalf of Venezuelan detainees who argued that the administration’s planned removals were unlawful under the Alien Enemies Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and constitutional due-process protections.

The filing alleged that the administration intended to use a forthcoming presidential proclamation to authorize ""immediate"" removals without judicial review, relying on a theory that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua constituted a ""foreign nation or government"" engaged in an ""invasion or predatory incursion.""

U.S. District Chief Judge James E. Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order the evening of March 15, 2025, barring the removal of the named plaintiffs for 14 days.

Disputed Flights and the Court’s Growing Concerns

Later filings revealed that two planes carrying Venezuelan detainees nevertheless landed in El Salvador.

The court subsequently initiated inquiries into whether that outcome violated its directive.

In a December 8, 2025 order, Judge Boasberg wrote that Secretary Noem had submitted a declaration stating she made ""the decision to continue the transfer of custody of the Alien Enemies Act detainees who had been removed from the United States before this Court issued its temporary restraining order in the evening of March 15, 2025.""

To establish a fuller factual record, Boasberg ordered that plaintiffs ""attempt to secure the presence of Erez Reuveni for testimony on December 15, 2025,"" and required the government to ""produce Drew Ensign for testimony on December 16, 2025.""

The judge found the declaration insufficient to determine whether Noem’s decision constituted a willful violation.

Because criminal contempt requires a showing that the order was ""clear and reasonably specific,"" that ""the defendant violated the order,"" and that ""the violation was willful,"" he wrote that ""the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt.""

Testimony That Could Define the Court’s Contempt Ruling

Reuveni is a former Justice Department attorney who has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging internal discussions about possibly disregarding judicial orders—allegations the administration denies.

Ensign, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, previously helped convey Boasberg’s oral and written orders to the Department of Homeland Security.

Boasberg described Noem’s filing as ""too ‘cursory’ to establish probable cause for criminal contempt"" and stated that further witness examination is necessary ""to clarify the decision-making around the flights to El Salvador before determining whether a contempt referral is warranted.""

Government attorneys have previously argued that the planes in question had already departed U.S. airspace before the restraining order was signed and that the migrants aboard them had therefore already been ""removed.""

As a result, they contend, the flights did not violate the order’s prohibition on removing ""any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days.""

The contempt inquiry runs parallel to the broader litigation over the legality of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation.

The complaint asserts that the Act can be invoked only during a declared war or an invasion by a foreign nation and argues that the administration’s application—focused on a transnational criminal group—was ultra vires [someone in power did something they had no legal authority to do].

That group was Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan-origin criminal organization that the administration attempted to treat as if it were a foreign government for purposes of invoking the Alien Enemies Act.

It further contends that the expedited removal process denied asylum rights, statutory protections under the Convention Against Torture, and due-process guarantees.

Judge Boasberg’s upcoming hearings are expected to clarify the administration’s internal communications and decision-making in the hours surrounding the restraining order.

Only after hearing from Reuveni and Ensign, he wrote, will the court determine whether the circumstances warrant a criminal contempt referral.

As the case proceeds, it continues to test the limits of executive immigration authority, the reach of wartime statutes, and the ability of federal courts to enforce emergency orders during fast-moving enforcement actions.

What People Are Saying

Kristi Noem on what should happen to the deported migrants in CECOT, said: ""We’re confident that people imprisoned there should be there…They should stay there for the rest of their lives.""

Emil Bove, DOJ, as quoted by whistleblower Erez Reuveni, allegedly told DOJ lawyers that ""the planes need to take off no matter what.""

What Happens Next

The court will now hear testimony from former DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign so Judge James Boasberg can determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem willfully violated his March 15 order halting migrant removals.

Only after evaluating their accounts and the surrounding decision-making will he decide whether a criminal-contempt referral is warranted, while the broader lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act continues on a separate track and may prompt additional injunctions or disclosures as the court works to prevent further removals during the litigation.",https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2247182200.jpg?w=1200crop=1,N,,2025-12-09 10:59:08.300748
,Policy,2025-12-09 14:08:18+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,"Democrats look to Miami mayoral race as litmus test on Trump economy, immigration policies",Cristian  Benavides,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-mayor-race-eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez/,"The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.
Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years.
The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.
Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.
""They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,"" he said.","It's been more than 30 years since Miami last elected a Democrat to serve as mayor, but the party feels this might be its best shot to reclaim victory in decades, as its candidate said a win would be a referendum on President Trump's immigration policy.

""What I will tell our congressional delegation and every person serving in Congress and the Senate is this immigration, these tactics, they're not only cruel, I grew up Catholic, I think they're also sinful,"" Eileen Higgins, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said.

Higgins, a county commissioner, is facing a runoff election against Republican hopeful Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, Miami-Dade County commissioner and director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President George W. Bush.

""My opponent would like this to be a referendum on the president,"" said Gonzalez, who has been endorsed by Mr. Trump. ""I want our voters to make this a referendum on me.""

While the race is technically a nonpartisan election, national Democrats have deployed resources for Higgins, including an endorsement video by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a visit from Arizona's Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego and a canvassing event with former Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel.

Higgins came in first in the Nov. 4 election with 36% of the vote, followed by Gonzalez's 19% — but since neither candidate reached 50% in a 13-person field, a runoff election between the top two candidates is set for Tuesday. Adding to the Democratic Party's optimism is early voting data, which shows Democrats outpacing Republicans by about 8%.

Florida Republicans have sought to downplay the significance of Tuesday's election. The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.

Yet a win for Democrats in Florida, Mr. Trump's adopted home state, and in the city that is set to become the site for his presidential library, would be a reversal in fortune for Republicans.

Mr. Trump handily won the state in 2024 by more than 13%. Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years. Statewide, Republicans have a 10-point registration lead over Democrats.

""She's certainly running a lot of high-energy efforts on the ground there, bringing in a big coalition, bringing in all types of folks to support her. I certainly think she has a great shot,"" said Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee Chair. ""Will be a big, big win if we win that.""

The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.

Mr. Trump again weighed in on the race Monday with a post on his social media platform Truth Social: ""Miami's Mayor Race is Tuesday. It is a big and important race!!! Vote for Republican Gonzalez. He is FANTASTIC! You can also vote today. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

The city of Miami has a population that is 57% foreign-born, according to the 2024 U.S. Census, and about half are naturalized U.S. Citizens who would be eligible to vote in the election. While Hispanic voters nationally trend toward the Democratic Party, in South Florida, Republicans have found a stronghold among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan exiles who fled communist and socialist governments.

However, Mr. Trump's immigration policy has come to something of a flashpoint in Florida. In addition to state troopers carrying out increased immigration enforcement, the Sunshine State is also home to the controversial ""Alligator Alcatraz"" detention center. The recent end of Temporary Protected Status for over 250,000 Venezuelans could also have considerable repercussions in a state with a large population of immigrants from the South American country, many of whom have been living in the U.S. for years and are deeply integrated in the local economy.

""It is ruining our economy,"" said Higgins. ""Sure, get the criminals out of here, but find a path to citizenship for people who deserve it and for an economy that needs it.""

Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.

""They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,"" he said. ""Why pick a fight about national immigration policy? Next, we are going to be talking about whether men should be in women's sports.""

Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground if she is elected, but warned, ""When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/09/01e72041-1aac-4b36-be3b-a81c677ff725/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e7b219ec368a3360b10698ed8a61db68/ap25342783681919.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:35.126175

But that may be little more than bluster in the eyes of the Trump administration.

Deep in the spending package that ended the 43-day government shutdown, Congress inserted a few lines forbidding USDA from using appropriated funds to close or consolidate research facilities — a provision aimed mainly at the department’s 6,000-acre flagship Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland — without approval from the House and Senate Appropriations committees.

That’s an old trick that sends a message but doesn’t have much legal bite if the administration chooses to ignore it, according to experts in constitutional law.

One of the best-placed skeptics is the USDA official running the reorganization: Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden, who as the department’s top lawyer during the first Trump administration declared similar measures unconstitutional.

The issue then was the administration’s relocation of USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture from Washington to Kansas City, which the department pursued unilaterally.

Congress can’t legally require USDA to secure approval of congressional committees to relocate offices or agencies, Vaden said at the time, since just one committee could theoretically block executive agencies from exercising an authority officials clearly have.

“USDA is not required to abide by unconstitutional laws,” Vaden said in a written response to a USDA inspector general’s report on the matter.

“Therefore,” Vaden wrote, “the Department declines OIG’s recommendation to ignore Supreme Court, Office of Legal Counsel, and Government Accountability Office precedent and seek congressional committee approval of the relocations.”

At issue is a Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chada, a 1983 case in which the justices ruled against the “legislative veto.” While the details are different — in that case, one house of Congress vetoed an executive action related to immigration — requiring agencies to obtain the permission of committees rings similar in some legal experts’ view.

“Presidents of both parties have argued that this type of oversight is unconstitutional,” said Michael Berry, an associate professor of political science at the University of Colorado, Denver, who has written on the subject.

From 1985 to 2010, Congress passed nearly 800 statutes requiring committee approval — up from 150 in the years before the Chada ruling, he said.

“Although such statutes often require approval from committees of both chambers, this type of oversight seems to violate the Constitution’s bicameralism and presidential presentment requirements, which were the central pillars of the Chadha ruling,” Berry said.

On the other hand, the idea’s never been directly tested, said Soren Dayton, director of American governance policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

“It’s a surprisingly complicated question,” Dayton said.

Political pressure

In the case of the two relocated research agencies — the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture — USDA under then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue moved swiftly enough that the relocation was locked in before Congress could meaningfully weigh in. And Republicans supported the move.

While the legal lines around congressional approval may be blurry, Dayton said, the real question comes down to political will: What’s the risk in the administration starting the gradual shutdown at Beltsville anyway, a process the agency has said will take several years?

The Beltsville closure is part of a broader reorganization the department is planning — and to the extent USDA needs money from Congress to pay for it, lawmakers have some control, Dayton said.

Officials at USDA say the facility has fallen into disrepair over the years and isn’t the stellar lab it once was, an argument for moving its work to other places.

“While BARC once used to be a state-of-the-art research facility, it is no longer worth the cost to bring it into the 21st century,” USDA said in a statement through a spokesperson.

The department added, “USDA would need $500 million to fully modernize BARC to improve the facility and an additional $40 million a year in maintenance to sustain operations. This is not a wise use of taxpayer dollars when there are other USDA laboratories across the country with the capacity to house the research being conducted here.”

‘Will of Congress’

Republicans in Congress largely support the reorganization, in part because it could mean more USDA jobs in their states or districts as employees are moved out of the national capital region.

USDA has shown some willingness to test the boundaries with appropriators this year, including blocking or rescinding grants and taking tens of millions of dollars away from certain Forest Service programs in the middle of the fiscal year to compensate employees who took deferred resignation offers, generating little complaint from Republican lawmakers.

However, ignoring congressional directives to obtain permission may be more confrontational than the administration wants to be, especially when both chambers are run by the president’s party.

Usually, departments abide by the language even though it’s legally questionable, said a former congressional appropriations aide who lobbies on related issues and requested anonymity to discuss them openly.

“We’d do it, knowing it’s not legal,” said the former aide.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) — who helped shepherd the provision into the final fiscal 2026 Agriculture-FDA bill — will continue to defend the Beltsville lab, his office said. The senator, joined by fellow Maryland Demoratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, also secured $6 million to modernize buildings there.

“BARC’s research helps farmers across our country put food on the table for millions of Americans,” Van Hollen said in statement.

He added: “The Senate on a bipartisan basis has made it clear that the Administration’s attempts to shutter BARC are not in line with the will of Congress. This is not only clear in the report language we secured, but also in the funds we included to modernize BARC’s facilities. We will continue working to support and protect the critical work being done by BARC.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/90/67/a1835023455abaeb4fb394ba21bb/agriculture-department-threats.JPEG,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:38.053283

In South Florida, thousands fleeing socialist tyrannies did it the right way: applied legally, passed background checks, waited their turn.
Their nickname encapsulates their position as an inflexible and strident trio, whose collaboration illustrates the president’s influence on South Florida politics.
The Trump administration has canceled humanitarian programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, many of them residents of Miami-Dade, to live and work legally in the country.
Salazar “has nothing to lose because in her district she has no one against her,” even if Trump reacts and decides to push a Republican opposition candidate.","Florida Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar has broken ranks with Cuban-American Republican lawmakers in Miami, calling the Trump administration’s decision to pause all immigration processes for citizens of 19 countries, including Cubans, Venezuelans and Haitians, “unfair” and “un-American.” The U.S. president announced the measure after two National Guard members were shot by an Afghan migrant in Washington D.C. before Thanksgiving.

“The United States doesn’t believe in collective punishment. We don’t punish the innocent for the sins of the guilty. Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process. That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for,” Salazar said in a statement sent to EL PAÍS.

“Background checks already exist to stop terrorists, and they should. In South Florida, thousands fleeing socialist tyrannies did it the right way: applied legally, passed background checks, waited their turn. Many of them ready to vote for democracy and freedom!” the congresswoman added.

Her statements contrast with those made by her fellow Cuban-American Republican congressmembers from Miami, Carlos Giménez and Mario Díaz-Balart, who held a separate press conference last Wednesday and said that the measure announced by the Trump administration was a consequence of the “reckless abandonment of border security” by the administration of former Democratic president Joe Biden.

For years, the three Cuban-American lawmakers have presented themselves as a cohesive political bloc, demanding a hard line against totalitarian regimes, applauding sanctions, and defending controversial measures in the public eye. In recent months, they have displayed almost monolithic unity in support of Trump and his agenda, to the point of being dubbed “the three crazy Cubans” by the president’s allies.

Their nickname encapsulates their position as an inflexible and strident trio, whose collaboration illustrates the president’s influence on South Florida politics. Last year, they joined forces to lobby the administration over an agreement that would have allowed Chevron to operate in Venezuela, a license that was subsequently not renewed. They have also publicly endorsed the president’s immigration policy, blaming the Biden administration for the migration crisis and portraying Trump’s measures as necessary for security, in line with the national Republican narrative.

A strategic shift

Salazar’s change of heart comes amid growing unrest in South Florida over the president’s immigration offensive, which has hit communities that supported him and helped turn Miami-Dade County — a Democratic stronghold for decades — Republican in the last presidential election.

The Trump administration has canceled humanitarian programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, many of them residents of Miami-Dade, to live and work legally in the country. It has also intensified operations to arrest migrants at workplaces, on highways, and in immigration courts, separating thousands of families and creating a climate of fear in these communities.

This climate has been politically exploited. The three legislators have been criticized by Democrats in advertising campaigns with billboards that have appeared on major Miami freeways, calling them “traitors” for their support of Trump’s immigration policies.

According to analysts, Salazar is adjusting her political strategy ahead of next year’s elections, aware that her district — Miami-Dade’s 27th, with 70% Hispanic voters and 20% immigrants — is particularly volatile and sensitive to the effects of Trump’s immigration policies. Experts believe this shift could strategically position her as a voice of reason within an increasingly polarized party, while also sending a clear message that immigration is a deeply personal reality in South Florida.

“Salazar is very vulnerable in her district, which is neither homogeneous nor historically Republican, but rather has a very particular and diverse demographic, with African-Americans, Haitians and Hispanics. Even a small shift among Hispanics could cause her to lose that district,” notes Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of Political Science at Florida International University (FIU). The congresswoman “is seeing in the polls that there is a negative reaction among Hispanics,” he adds.

Gamarra led a study in May on the sentiment among Venezuelans after the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and the humanitarian parole program, where 43% of those surveyed said that Miami-Dade’s representatives in Congress — Díaz-Balart, Salazar and Giménez — had not adequately defended the Venezuelan diaspora on immigration matters.

“She won’t be able to win reelection with Trump and the Republicans’ policies, especially with this new hardening that has basically frozen all applications, from marriages to naturalization ceremonies. She has to move away from that hardline position,” Gamarra says. “She knows, given the demographics of her district, that she has to react, because otherwise they’re going to elect a Democrat.”

Dr. Andrew Seele, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said that “the more indiscriminate the policies are on immigration enforcement, the more likely they are to touch on people who are American voters.”

According to Guillermo Grenier, a sociology professor at FIU, Salazar’s decision is more personal. “Salazar has been uncomfortable with the immigration situation for some time, and this time she said, ‘Enough is enough.’ She’s reading the same polls as everyone else, which indicate that Trump is overstepping his bounds, and on a personal level, she saw that her position had to change,” he says.

Salazar “has nothing to lose because in her district she has no one against her,” even if Trump reacts and decides to push a Republican opposition candidate. “Her position in the party as one of the three ‘Crazy Cubans’ — now the least ‘crazy’ of the three — is firmly established, and she’s saying something that most people — Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians, whoever — are thinking: that Trump has been overstepping his bounds legally, that is, he’s gone beyond what the law allows. What she’s said is, in fact, what the polls show and what people are talking about: that what’s happening is dangerous,” he adds.

Grenier believes the congresswoman has made “a very politically sensible decision, because she is distancing herself from Trump’s arguments that have a negative impact on Miami-Dade,” without directly pointing the finger at anyone.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/NH2UF63NJNCKPORUBZ4IEY6A3A.jpg?auth=5038368523e4a33aacbb2711119617214a0f8d38f41d62f5e27b44f26d7bf062&width=1200,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:43.178154

“I believe if we’re going to beat him, we’ve got to fight now.” On other fronts, too, there are efforts to draw lines related to immigration enforcement.","The table of immigration-related bills in the Hawaiʻi Legislature’s next session was at least partially set Monday, as advocates described measures they want to see introduced and painted a picture of legal rights being trampled under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Among the bills that died last session that advocates will be pushing for again is one to address ICE’s ability to conduct enforcement actions in what have been dubbed “sensitive places,” such as schools, hospitals and churches.

“It’s not that we can keep the feds from coming in anywhere that they want to if they followed the proper procedure,” said Liza Ryan Gill, co-coordinator of the Hawaiʻi Coalition for Immigrant Rights. “But we can set protocols on making sure that they follow the proper procedure. So you can’t just bust in if you didn’t get your warrant signed by a judge.”

Another would prohibit local law enforcement officers from being deputized as immigration agents through agreements with the federal government. Under those 287(g) agreements — there are now about 1,200 nationwide, up from 135 in January — police officers can perform immigration-related enforcement such as questioning immigrants in custody about their immigration status, and arresting and turning them over to ICE.

The police departments in all four Hawaiʻi counties already have agreements with federal agencies including Homeland Security Investigations, a division of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE. But police officials have said those agreements enable officers to take part in law enforcement operations aimed at transnational crimes such as drug or human trafficking— and that they do not allow officers to join in immigration enforcement. Critics say the agreements are a slippery slope that make that all too possible.

The hearing at the state Senate Judiciary Committee was called by Sen. Karl Rhoads, the only lawmaker in attendance. He offered the advocates a friendly forum. In the 2025 legislative session, Rhoads introduced a bill to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from collaborating with the federal government for immigration purposes except in limited cases. It died at the committee level before getting a vote.

A former lawyer, he opened Monday’s meeting by saying some of the administration’s enforcement policies and actions “appear to me to be of dubious legality.”

More Than Just Criminals

The hearing was partly an opportunity to correct narratives that undocumented immigrants are all criminals who hurt the economy, said longtime Hawaiʻi civil rights activist Amy Agbayani. “Data do not support that,” she said, adding that one in five state ​​residents is foreign-born.

The Trump administration, while claiming to be going after hardened criminals, has targeted many others, including immigrants with legal residency status and people who turned out to be U.S. citizens, she and other advocates said.

ICE officers arrested 153 people in Hawaiʻi between January and July — a 273% increase from the same period in 2024, when there were 41 arrests, said Bettina Mok, executive director of The Legal Clinic, a nonprofit that provides legal, education and advocacy services to immigrants.

But 67% of people held by ICE at the federal detention center near the Honolulu airport have no criminal record, and “very few” have been charged with a violent crime, Mok said.

Rhoads returned repeatedly to the question of whether ICE has been violating constitutionally guaranteed due process rights during arrests.

He expressed disbelief when Mok described the case of a young man from Central America who was in Florida on a student visa and was arrested for speeding. He was turned over to ICE after police found out he was not actively enrolled in college, Mok said, and was transferred six or seven times among federal detention facilities before ending up in Hawaiʻi’s.

The student, Mok said, had never been told what he was being detained for.

“The lawyer in me is just like, ‘What?’” Rhoads said.

At another point, Rhoads asked for advocates to ignore his law degree and explain due process.

“Does that apply to everybody or is that just U.S. citizens? If you get picked up for whatever reasons do you always have the right to some sort of due process?”

“It should apply to everyone but what we have seen is that the same rights that should be afforded are not being given to immigrants or detained individuals,” said Stephanie Haro Sevilla, a fellow and immigrant advocate at the Refugee and Immigration Law Clinic at the University of Hawaiʻi law school.

‘You’re Not Immune’

After the hearing, Rhoads told Civil Beat that he was concerned a lot of people “see the stuff on TV from the continent and they think, ‘Well, that doesn’t have anything to do with us here in Hawaii.’ And that’s not true. I want people to know that this kind of stuff is happening here, and that if there’s no due process, you’re not immune to it either.”

Gill of the Hawaiʻi Coalition for Immigrant Rights said based on preliminary discussions with legislators, she is confident the bills she and allies are backing — including one that would clarify the criteria under which immigrants who are crime victims can become eligible for residency — will get a hearing in the next session.

What happens next, she said, is up to legislators who should know by now that the president sees very few limits to his authority.

“I’m sympathetic to the idea that under the first Trump administration, it’s like, ‘OK, well if we don’t cross this particular line, then maybe X, Y, or Z won’t happen,’” Gill said. “What is so different about this, the second administration, is that none of that holds water anymore.”

It’s hard to forecast the prospects for immigration-related bills in the upcoming session, Rhoads said.

“There’s a big divide in the Legislature,” he said.

There are lawmakers who believe “laying low” is the best way to get through the Trump era, Rhoads said. “I believe if we’re going to beat him, we’ve got to fight now.”

On other fronts, too, there are efforts to draw lines related to immigration enforcement.

Response

It may be helpful to explain that under current constitutional arrangements in the United Kingdom (UK), asylum and immigration are reserved to the UK Parliament and handled by the Home Office. This includes the provision of asylum accommodation and support to people seeking asylum who would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application. It also includes decisions relating to UK immigration policy, including the application of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) conditions and other restrictions or conditions applied to people seeking asylum, visa holders and anyone who requires permission to enter or remain in the UK but does not have it. The Scottish Government has no control of these processes.

People who have entered the UK irregularly and have not made an asylum application would be undocumented and would be subject to immigration control, and under reserved immigration legislation and rules they would subject to NRPF.

In the UK, the term person seeking asylum, or asylum seeker, refers to someone who has lodged an application for international protection under the United Nations (UN) 1951 Refugee Convention or Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and is waiting for a decision from the UK Government. An asylum application is therefore a process to determine whether someone is recognised as a refugee. The UK has international legal obligations to recognise refugees who are present in the UK.

Asylum is the process by which someone applies to the UK Government to have their refugee status recognised.

1. How many illegal migrants have been permanently housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Stirling and Edinburgh in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

We do not hold any information on illegal immigrants that have been housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness or Stirling in the past 3 years. People who require permission to enter or remain in the UK are restricted from accessing local authority housing or homeless services.

This is a formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

2. How many asylum seekers have been permanently housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Stirling and Edinburgh in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. We do not hold information about the total number of people seeking asylum provided with accommodation by the UK Government over the past three years in Scotland or in the cities you have specified in your request.

This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

The UK Government regularly publishes statistical data online which may be of interest in relation to your request. To note, many of the data tables report the number of people at the end of a quarter, not cumulative totals, and therefore the total number of people in the asylum system over a certain time period may not be able to be calculated. Table Asy_D11 includes the number of people in receipt of asylum accommodation and/or support and is available in the quarterly immigration system statistics data tables on the UK Government website: Immigration system statistics data tables - GOV.UK.

You may also find information which has already been published under previous information requests, as part of statistical releases, or otherwise made available on the UK Government website.

Regional and local authority data, including a breakdown for Scotland, is available here: Regional and local authority data on immigration groups - GOV.UK.

3. How many have gone unchecked/unvetted by Police Scotland in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. The Scottish Government holds no information in relation to individuals known to have criminal convictions in their country of origin and also the nature of their crimes. No information is held with regards to recorded offences committed by those with no legal status since arriving in Scotland.

As such, I hereby provide you with formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

You may however find it useful to consult the UK Government website for published information which may be relevant to your request: Statistics on foreign national offenders and the immigration system - GOV.UK.

4. How much of Scottish taxpayer's money is being used to house, feed, maintain the lives of each individual asylum seeker and/or illegal immigrant?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. The Scottish Government does not hold information on how much taxpayers money is used for each individual asylum seeker/illegal migrant.

The taxpayer cost is likely to vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual needs and eligibility of the individual and any time spent in the UK asylum system. As explained above, people seeking asylum and undocumented migrants (people who require leave to enter or remain in the UK but do not have it) are subject to No Recourse to Public Funds, this means that they cannot access certain public funds as defined under the UK Immigration Rules. This includes restriction from accessing local authority housing, most mainstream benefits like Universal Credit and emergency crisis payments from the Scottish Welfare Fund.

People seeking asylum may be provided with asylum accommodation and/or financial support if they would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application from the UK Government. As provision of asylum accommodation and support is reserved, the Scottish Government does not hold information relating to the cost of this provision.

This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

You may however find it useful to consult the following link which sets out the Scottish Governments spending and tax plans for the year ahead: Scottish Budget 2025 to 2026 - gov.scot.

5. Were there public consultations with the people of Scotland to ask our permission to house them here? If so, please provide dates, locations of these meetings, minutes of these meetings including the voting ratio results of the public poll at these meetings.

As explained, the UK has international legal obligations to recognise refugees who are in the UK. This is because the UK is a founding signatory to the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. The 1951 Convention was the culmination of international cooperation to assemble a set of guidelines, laws and conventions aimed at protecting everyone’s basic human rights and the treatment of people forced to flee conflict and persecution, following significant displacement during the first and second world wars in Europe. More information about the 1951 Convention can be found on the UNHCR website: The 1951 Refugee Convention | UNHCR UK.

The UK operates an asylum application system to determine whether people who have presented to the UK Government to be recognised as a refugee meet the definition of a refugee as set out in the 1951 Convention or require protection under any other relevant legislation or conventions to which the UK is a signatory. People seeking asylum can apply to the Home Secretary for asylum accommodation and/or support if they would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application.

The UK Government is responsible for UK asylum policy, legislation and rules. The Scottish Government does not hold information about whether any public consultations were undertaken by UK Governments since the 1951 Refugee Convention was signed. This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

It may be helpful to note that the dispersal of people seeking asylum to accommodation across the UK was introduced under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. For over two decades Glasgow was the only Scottish local authority to participate in dispersal, however in 2022 the UK Government introduced full dispersal policy which presumed asylum accommodation could be procured in any local authority across the UK, rather than only in those local authorities which had voluntarily agreed to participate.

Additionally, as asylum and immigration are reserved to the UK Parliament and handled by the Home Office, you may wish to contact the Home Office at foirequests@homeoffice.gov.uk to find out whether there is further information which they would be able to provide in relation to your request.

You may also find information which has already been published under previous information requests, as part of statistical releases, or otherwise made available on the UK Government website: Home Office - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)

Arrested immigrants sue Trump administration

What we know:

Since the immigration enforcement operation started on Dec. 1, the Trump administration said it has arrested some of ""the worst of the worst,"" a phrase it has used to describe those in the country illegally, with criminal histories.

According to federal court filings, 11 immigrants have sued the administration in federal court in Minnesota in December. Four of the lawsuits were filed by immigrants who were arrested since the ongoing enforcement operation launched.

Nearly all are challenging their detention, and at least three of them face deportation. Some said they are seeking asylum or are eligible for it. Another said he has a pending visa application. And another said he is in the country legally and is eligible for naturalization.

Abdul Dahir Ibrahim, who came to the United States from Somalia in 1995 and now lives in Shakopee, was ordered removed in 2004. He was arrested on Nov. 29, shortly before the immigration operation started.

In a social media post announcing his arrest, Homeland Security officials said he was ordered deported after asylum and fraud convictions in Canada.

The agency also included photos of Ibrahim with several Minnesota Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, among others. The connection between Ibrahim and the elected leaders beyond the photographs is not clear.

According to court records, Ibrahim was granted and then lost his immigration status and is awaiting a hearing on his most recent application to renew that status. Until then, he is subject to deportation, the records said.

Another man, Mahamed Cabdilaahi Awaale, immigrated to the United States from Somalia in 2022 after a member of his wife’s tribe stabbed him and killed his mother, court records said. He is seeking asylum.

“Nearly all the alleged harms are purported injuries to the operations of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, for which Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in their individual capacities.
The “GJ Highway Hitters” group chat included officers from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol, Vail Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).","Last week, Mesa County filed a motion in federal court arguing that by preventing local law enforcement from sharing immigration information with federal law enforcement, the laws make it impossible for local law enforcement to conduct drug task force activities because the federal government maintains the national databases used in drug enforcement.

“As part of their law enforcement duties wholly unrelated to federal immigration enforcement, Plaintiffs regularly obtain and transmit information that is used to identify an individual for purposes of legitimate state and local law enforcement functions,” the document stated.

On Aug. 7, Mesa County filed a lawsuit in federal court against Polis and Weiser alleging a series of laws passed between 2021 and 2025 pertaining to disclosing personal information for the purposes federal immigration enforcement known as “Article 74” conflict with federal law and are unconstitutionally vague or otherwise unenforceable.

The lawsuit seeks an injunction against enforcing the Article 74 laws until they can be clarified.

Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell, Undersheriff Matt King and Captain Curtis Brammer are named as plaintiffs in the suit in their individual capacities.

The lawsuit was filed in response to a lawsuit from Weiser’s office against former Sheriff’s deputy Alexander Zwinck, which alleged Zwinck had violated Article 74 by providing information to federal immigration enforcement during a traffic stop that led to the detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of a college student from Utah who had lived in the United States for 12 years and had no criminal history.

On June 5, Zwinck stopped Caroline Dias Goncalves near Loma for following a semi-trailer too closely, according to body camera footage of the stop.

Zwinck shared a picture of Dias Goncalves’ driver’s license with a group chat called “GJ Highway Hitters” that included federal immigration enforcement, according to an investigation into the stop. After letting Dias Goncalves off with a warning, he provided the chat with a description of her vehicle and direction of travel.

Dias Goncalves was born in Brazil and moved to Utah at age seven. She has no criminal history but had a visa issue, according to an investigation into the stop.

In a statement, Rowell apologized to Dias Goncalves for his office’s role in the incident.

An administrative investigation by the Sheriff’s Office found that Zwinck had violated several Sheriff’s Office policies and Article 74 laws, and the deputy was disciplined with three weeks of unpaid leave. He later resigned from the Sheriff’s Office.

Weiser’s office dropped its lawsuit against Zwinck after he resigned from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office.

The county’s lawsuit against Polis and Weiser continues, however.

Polis and Weiser filed a motion on Oct. 30 asking for the county’s lawsuit to be dismissed, saying the county’s case lacks standing, and that the laws in question are not so vague to be voided in a legal challenge, and do not conflict with federal law as claimed in the county’s initial complaint.

“Nearly all the alleged harms are purported injuries to the operations of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, for which Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in their individual capacities. The remaining alleged harms involve speculation about hypothetical future enforcement actions. Emphasizing the lack of an actual case or controversy, Plaintiffs identify a list of hypothetical questions for which they seek advisory opinions. And all claims against the Governor are barred by sovereign immunity,” the motion to dismiss stated.

In a response filed Dec. 4, the county argued the lawsuit should not be dismissed, and should be allowed to proceed on its merits so the laws can be clarified.

“As drafted, the new law is both indefinite and vague, making it impossible for Plaintiffs to do their jobs,” the county’s response stated. “This flaw is especially important because Article 74 punishes those who ‘intentionally’ violate its provisions with a fine of up to $50,000.”

The response stated the laws punish actions local law enforcement officers take in the course of their regular duties not related to immigration enforcement, and gave the lawsuit against Zwinck as an example.

“Simply stated, Plaintiffs contend that performance of their duties could subject them to prosecution similar to the enforcement actions Defendants have already taken,” the response stated.

The response also said the enforcement of Article 74 laws has been arbitrary, as Weiser’s office sued Zwinck but not other officers who engaged in similar conduct. The “GJ Highway Hitters” group chat included officers from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol, Vail Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

The county’s filing stated, “as employees within Article 74’s scope facing a similar threat of litigation and enforcement, and with no other mechanism available to them to avoid prosecution, Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to obtain clarity and finality as to what conduct is or is not prohibited under the statutes, and whether they even pass constitutional muster.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/7d/c7d90487-e4cb-48d9-b002-dfaec67860a3/68ae1a61e5a89.image.jpg?crop=1344%2C706%2C0%2C194&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-09 06:57:20.817492

We began this year uncertain about what exactly would unfold, but certain of two things: the unparalleled power of the American people and the Democracy Forward community’s commitment to doing whatever it takes to harness that power to fight autocratic threats. As the Trump-Vance administration trampled on Constitutional rights, dismantled core protections, deployed the military in our communities, oversaw raids, and made it harder for Americans to make ends meet, the American people have met the moment. And, because of you, we have too.

When the president threatened lawyers and law firms, our Democracy Forward community was strong, ensuring that the American people are able to access the courts, represented by exceptional lawyers who are winning court orders at historic rates. We have been able to mount scaled responses to the Trump-Vance administration’s federal attacks — filing hundreds of legal actions and winning — while also continuing our mission-critical work in states and communities across the nation.

“In the United States there is no king.” These words appeared in the lawsuit we filed in the early weeks of this administration, challenging the president’s mission to rewrite history and stamp out free speech. The call has been repeated across the nation as millions have mobilized in the largest peaceful protests in U.S. history, determined to defend our rights. As powerful institutions have stepped back, the people have stepped forward. And, with your support, the people of this nation have been able to make their case heard both in the court of law and in the court of public opinion.

These pages provide a mere glimpse of the wins that you have supported and the impact our work has had for the American people this past year. They also show how we have used momentary setbacks to push forward, and how we are working to transform this historic crisis in our nation as a catalyst for generational change.

Uncertainty is still with us. But our work this year has made us all the more certain that the people can — and will — prevail. Courage is now the new currency — you have shown us that with your support.

We are made for this moment and we are ready for what’s next. We are so grateful to have you with us.
