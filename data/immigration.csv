According to a social media post by Trump, that census would exclude millions of people living in the country without legal status — an unprecedented change to how the country has conducted population tallies since the first U.S. census in 1790.
In a statement, the Commerce Department said: ""The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data.

According to a social media post by Trump, that census would exclude millions of people living in the country without legal status — an unprecedented change to how the country has conducted population tallies since the first U.S. census in 1790.

The 14th Amendment requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be included in a key set of census numbers used to determine how presidents and members of Congress are elected.

The Trump administration has released no details about the plan. As a result, much is unclear, such as whether Trump — who, according to the Constitution, does not have final authority over the census — is referring to the regularly scheduled national head count in 2030 or an earlier tally.

Trump said he's instructed the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to ""immediately begin work"" on a census using ""the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024."" It's unclear why the election results would matter to the census.

The press office for the White House did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.

In a statement, the Commerce Department said: ""The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

The Constitution did not grant a president final authority over the census

Article 1 of the Constitution empowers Congress — not the president — to carry out the ""actual enumeration"" of the country's population in ""such manner as they shall by law direct."" In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the secretary of commerce to follow a once-a-decade census schedule.

Under that same law, the commerce secretary can conduct a mid-decade census, in 2025, but the results can't be used for redistributing each state's share of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and votes in the Electoral College. And the question topics for such a 2025 census would have needed to be reported to Congress years ago.

Still, while the Constitution requires a census every 10 years for the once-a-decade redistribution of congressional seats, it's not clear whether a head count could be conducted another year, with results used for reapportioning each state's share of House seats and Electoral College votes.

Trump's demand for a new census appears to align with a House bill that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, introduced last month. That bill calls for not only excluding noncitizens from the apportionment numbers, but also a new census and round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election.

Asked about the bill, Trump said in July, ""It's going to get in. It's going to pass, and we're going to be very happy.""

This year, other Republicans in Congress have reintroduced bills that call for excluding either people without legal status or all people without U.S. citizenship, including green card holders, from the regularly scheduled 2030 apportionment counts.

Trump's census comments on Thursday also come after his vocal push for Republicans in various states to redistrict in an attempt to pick up more seats in the U.S. House. The GOP's gambit to redraw the congressional map in Texas has set off a national political battle, with Democrats in other states preparing potential responses, including their own partisan gerrymandering.

""It is no coincidence that President Trump wants to manipulate the census data at the same time he is pressuring Republican states to gerrymander even more,"" says John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, in a statement. ""This is a comprehensive campaign to flout the U.S. Constitution in order to predetermine election outcomes so he can consolidate his power and avoid accountability to the American people.""

Hours after Trump's post, the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that led lawsuits over Trump's failed efforts to change who was counted in the 2020 census, signaled another legal battle may be on the horizon. In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said any attempt by the Trump administration to exclude U.S. residents without legal status from a census ""would defy the Constitution, federal law, and settled precedent.""

""We won't hesitate to go back to court to protect representation for all communities,"" Lakin added.

If Trump is referring to the 2030 census, legal experts say that Trump's successor or Congress may — in 2029 — have an opportunity to get rid of any added question about a person's immigration status before it's printed on paper forms for the 2030 census.

The Census Bureau is in the middle of a years-long process to gear up for that census. Last month, it released the first version of its operational plan for that count, and it has been scheduled to start recruiting this fall for temporary workers to carry out the ""2026 Census Test,"" a major field test for its 2030 plans that's set to take place in six areas in the South and West.

Coming days after Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after the release of a weaker-than-expected jobs report, Trump's call for a census ""using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024"" resurfaces concerns about the integrity of the data the federal government produces, says Meeta Anand, senior director of census and data equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

""To me, that represents an attempt to undermine and sow doubt on existing data and to raise the specter of manipulating data going forward,"" Anand says. ""It's all part and parcel of the same playbook of telling people not to believe what is existing already and what has been collected and tabulated and reported in accordance with scientific standards and principles, and instead to believe what is being put in front of them without evidence for the purposes of political gain.""

Trump's 2020 census bid to exclude people without legal status was stopped

Trump's latest push renews similar efforts from his first administration. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately stopped a question about a person's U.S. citizenship status from being added to 2020 census forms but declined to rule on whether people without legal status can be, for the first time in U.S. history, excluded by the president from apportionment counts.

Former President Joe Biden affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in the states in those tallies with a 2021 executive order, which Trump revoked on the first day of his second term.

Using the census to ask about a person's immigration status has yet to be tested by the Census Bureau.

But research by the bureau shows that using the once-a-decade tally by the federal government to ask the question ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" is likely to produce faulty self-reported data and discourage many households with Latino or Asian American residents from getting counted. Population totals are also used for dividing up trillions in federal funding for public services in communities across the country.

The bureau's researchers have also warned that attempting to produce neighborhood-block level citizenship data with a new census question would be ""very costly,"" harm the quality of other demographic statistics the census produces and yield ""substantially less accurate"" data than information available from existing government records about people's citizenship status.

The Supreme Court found the first Trump administration's stated justification for a census citizenship question — to better enforce the voting rights of racial minority groups — appeared ""contrived.""

As a result, Trump issued a 2019 executive order that spelled out other reasons for producing citizenship data, which would be more detailed than the estimates the bureau already releases. They included informing immigration policy and eligibility rules for public benefits, and coming up with a count of people in the U.S. without legal status. Another reason the order outlined was allowing state and local governments to draw voting districts that do not account for children and non-U.S. citizens. That radical departure from current standard redistricting practices would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" a 2015 report by a Republican redistricting strategist concluded. Its legality is an open question before the Supreme Court.

A 2020 presidential memorandum ultimately confirmed another goal for Trump's first push for a citizenship question — data that would allow for the unprecedented exclusion of immigrants in the U.S. without legal status from the congressional apportionment counts.

While officials in the first Trump administration often emphasized that some past national head counts have asked about people's U.S. citizenship status in some way, census records going back to 1820 show that Trump's proposal bucks centuries of precedent. The federal government has never before used the census to directly ask for the citizenship status of every person living in every household in the United States.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4480x2520+0+382/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F08%2F5ee8064b46929c3862e04baec3f3%2Fgettyimages-1138922782.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 02:56:38.411083

“Even if they were to lose in the Supreme Court, I have serious doubts they will stop,” Segall said.","The Trump administration on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on “roving patrols” implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment.

The restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

Under the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles found in her original decision.

The Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong’s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.”

Lawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration’s arguments.

“This is unprecedented,” said Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel, part of the coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. “The brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.”

The move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck — actions some experts said appeared to violate the court’s order.

If the Supreme Court takes up the case, many now think similar aggressive and seemingly indiscriminate enforcement actions could once again become the norm.

“Anything having to do with law enforcement and immigration, the Supreme Court seems to be giving the president free rein,” said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law and a prominent scholar of the country’s highest court. “I think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.”

The Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes “manifest irreparable harm” to the government. Officials are especially eager to see it overturned because California’s Central District is the single most populous in the country, and home to a plurality of undocumented immigrants.

In its Supreme Court petition, the Justice Department alleged that roughly 10% of the region’s residents are in the U.S. illegally.

“According to estimates from Department of Homeland Security data, nearly 4 million illegal aliens are in California, and nearly 2 million are in the Central District of California. Los Angeles County alone had an estimated 951,000 illegal aliens as of 2019 — by far the most of any county in the United States,” the petition said.

President Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives.

District and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of “Alligator Alcatraz.”

But little of the president’s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.

If the outcome is unfavorable for Trump, some observers wonder whether he will let the justices limit his agenda.

Why It Matters

Trump's directive for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants from the count threatens to reshape how congressional representation is allocated across the United States. If implemented, it would mark a significant departure from long-standing census practice, potentially shifting political power, especially in states with large immigrant populations.

Legal, logistical, and constitutional questions surround the move, with historical precedent and recent court decisions casting uncertainty on its ultimate fate. The development comes as several states, led by Texas, consider early or mid-decade redistricting based on changing population data.

What To Know

Trump's directive cited the 2024 presidential election data as providing the impetus for an overhaul of current census methodologies.

Redistricting in the United States traditionally follows the decennial census, where the U.S. Census Bureau counts every person residing in the country, regardless of immigration status. This count is then used to determine how the 435 House seats are distributed among the 50 states, a process called reapportionment.

In Texas, Republicans have supported a plan, backed by Trump, that relies on new census data to propose redistricting before the end of the current decade. This plan would reportedly deliver five additional Republican seats in Congress, significantly affecting the Democratic Party's ability to reclaim a majority in the House.

The proposal echoes Trump's prior attempt in 2020 to exclude undocumented immigrants from census counts used for apportionment. This effort was blocked in the courts and sidestepped by the Supreme Court, which declared the case premature due to unresolved facts and implementation challenges.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post on Thursday morning: ""I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024. People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, at a press conference on August 1, regarding undocumented immigrants: ""I think it's wrong. I think it's unconstitutional that they're counted in the census.""

New York Law School Adjunct Professor and Senior Fellow Jeffrey Wice told Fox13: ""The Congress debated whether or not to count citizens only, and the decision was made back in the 1860s that the reapportionment was to be based on the whole number of persons, regardless of their status.""

What Happens Next

The fate of Trump's order depends on multiple factors: legal challenges, administrative capacity, and the positions of state and federal courts.

The Supreme Court previously hesitated to endorse similar measures, and lower courts have ruled such exclusions unconstitutional or illegal under federal law. If the administration attempts to move forward, renewed litigation is likely.

But the census is a massive undertaking and has huge repercussions nationally, including on congressional seat alignment — so it's not something that can be changed quickly. In fact, the Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.

Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: ""The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

Here's what to know about the census process:

The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years

Per Article I, Section 2: ""The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct."" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.

The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030

It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in 2019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the bureau's timeline has them in the ""Development and Integration Phase"" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.

Citizenship question in the Census?

In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was ""contrived"" and ""pretextual."" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.

The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting

Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the ""American Community Survey"" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a sample of households in all 50 states. This survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.

""No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,"" the Census website states.

Is political party collected in the Census?

No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.

Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census

The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.

How do Congressional seats work with the Census?

In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.

Given population changes, the number of Congressional seats each state gets is determined by the census. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in July suggested that the census should be redone since he believed Florida should have gotten two new seats instead of just one.

Based off the number of seats each state receives, the Congressional districts are then set, either by the state legislature or an independent commission. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a redistricting battle in Texas, where he has instructed the state's Republicans to redraw the districts to give the GOP an advantage in up to five more seats.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/07/7efd0f5b-9cf1-4ad8-a1ad-a160e50bccc5/thumbnail/1200x630/3ba06971291b7c03351e0c5d44a73b46/ap25013537846391.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 02:56:51.067704

Asked to clarify Trump’s plan and what information from last year’s presidential election the president was referring to, a Commerce Department spokesperson did not directly answer those questions.

“The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

The U.S. Constitution dictates certain terms for the decennial census, with Article 1, Section 2 saying that representation in Congress will be determined by “adding the whole Number of free persons” and that the apportionment of congressional representation shall be conducted “every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.”

The 14th Amendment to the Constitution expands the qualifications for being counted in the census and in reapportionment to ""the whole number of persons in each state.""

A census plan that leaves undocumented immigrants out of the count would likely face legal challenges.

In a statement, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, condemned Trump's statement and predicted the proposal would be blocked by federal courts.

""This is a comprehensive campaign to flout the U.S. Constitution in order to predetermine election outcomes so he can consolidate his power and avoid accountability to the American people,"" Bisognano said. ""The U.S. Constitution is clear: all persons must be counted every decade as part of the census. This attempt to manipulate the census data was stopped in court in 2020, and if he follows through with this authoritarian proposal, it will be stopped again.”

Trump has long pondered the question of citizenship as it relates to the census. During his first administration, he sought to have a citizenship question on the 2020 census, but was shot down by the Supreme Court.

At the time, the Trump administration planned to include all people in the U.S. in the census regardless of citizenship. But Trump and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also planned to ask whether respondents to the census were citizens of the U.S.

Independent analyses, including by the Census Bureau at the time, found that millions of people could go uncounted if they were presented with a citizenship question on the census.

In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government has the right to ask about citizenship on the census, but that the administration did not properly justify why it hoped to change the long-standing practice of not including the question in the census.

Afterward, Trump sought to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, and he was buoyed by the Supreme Court's dismissal of a challenge to that plan in December 2020. Although the decision would have allowed Trump to move forward with the plan, the subsequent swearing-in of Joe Biden as president prevented him from implementing it.

Other questions about the census — including whether it should be conducted by random sampling or by a direct count — have long plagued presidential administrations confronted with the task of counting every person in the U.S. every 10 years.

Though the next presidential administration would be in charge of administering the 2030 census, the Trump administration would still oversee the beginning of the process, including a determination about what questions would be asked.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-01/230129-census-form-jm-1608-a491c0.jpg",N,,2025-08-08 02:56:55.805342

The type of assault he suffered is included in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services list of crimes that qualify for a U visa, a measure designed for victims of criminal acts in the U.S. who agree to help authorities investigate the crime.

“I feel sad. I’m trying to gather my strength, but there are so many things happening here. Many of us are having our rights violated,” said the married father of three children, adding that he's been in the process of obtaining a visa since 2021.

Magdalena Metelska, the immigration attorney handling Mendoza Méndez’s case, said that other administrations didn’t take coercive measures against victims applying for U visas, but that has changed with the second Trump administration.

Now, if someone has a visa pending and even been given a work permit notification, like Mendoza Méndez, ""it doesn’t really matter because these people are also being arrested and detained,” she said.

In April, Jose Madrid-Leiva, a Guatemalan immigrant who was waiting for a U visa, was detained in Kansas City. That same month, Guatemalan immigrant Gerber Mazariegos Dávila, who was applying for a U visa, was detained by ICE agents in Atlanta. In June, Esvin Juárez and Rosmeri Miranda-López, a Guatemalan couple with four children whose U visa application had been approved were deported to their homeland.

A benefit and a law enforcement tool — with a big backlog

The U visa was created by Congress in 2000 through the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act and is reserved for victims of certain crimes who “have suffered physical or mental harm” and who cooperate with law enforcement or government officials “in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity,” according to USCIS.

“The U visa is a humanitarian benefit, but it’s also a law enforcement tool,"" explained Hannah Shapiro, supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal help to low-income families and individuals. ""It requires the individual to cooperate in an investigation or prosecution related to the visa-qualifying offenses, which can be recent or have occurred several years ago.”

She added the visa was designed to make communities safer by incentivizing undocumented survivors of domestic abuse and other crimes to contact police and cooperate in investigations, thus helping make abusers accountable.

The U visa's benefits include the ability to live and work in the U.S. and a chance to apply for a green card in the future. However, as with other visas for victims of abuse and crime, such as the Special Immigrant Juvenile program, the U.S. government only grants 10,000 U visas per year, which has created a considerable backlog for applicants.

There are more than 300,000 people waiting, in addition to qualifying family members, Shapiro explained, and the process can take up to 15 or 20 years.

According to USCIS numbers, the government received 266,293 primary U visa applications from fiscal year 2017 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.

“This means that if all U visa applications were halted today, it would take more than 20 years to resolve the pending cases. Since fiscal year 2009, USCIS has seen a 2013% increase in pending cases,” USCIS said in a statement sent to Noticias Telemundo.

Since June 2021, USCIS has been granting “good faith determinations” — official documents that validate the legitimacy of the U visa application and protects applicants from deportation while giving them work authorization.

Recent changes, fewer protections

Immigration experts and attorneys say the Trump administration is now asserting that “good faith determinations” do not protect people from deportation, leading to detentions of U visa applicants.

“I always carried in my wallet the letter of good faith that ICE had approved for me, which states that I have the right to be in the United States without fear of deportation. But the agents told me they were no longer respecting that. And they took me away,” said Mendoza Méndez.

Matthew J. Tragesser, chief of USCIS' Office of Public Affairs, said in a statement to Noticias Telemundo that “a good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.”

Tragesser also stated that “the U visa program is being exploited by foreign scammers and criminals, their corrupt lawyers, and law enforcement officers,” though he did not provide specific figures or cases.

Last month, USCIS announced that five Louisiana men, including four active and retired law enforcement officers, had been charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit visa fraud and mail fraud following a federal investigation that uncovered a pattern of inconsistencies in U visa applications. According to the agency, the defendants filed false police reports so that foreign nationals who were supposedly victims of the thefts could apply for U visas.

A shift away from victims' protections

Although the fundamental structure of the U visa program remains intact (since it was created by Congress, it can't be unilaterally eliminated), several experts and applicants say its practical implementation has become significantly harder.

“Shortly after Trump returned to power, they repealed a memorandum that considered victim status a discretionary factor that, except in extenuating or more serious circumstances, should not be a priority for removal. This is even true if their case was pending and had not been approved,” Shapiro said.

The attorney refers to Memorandum 11005.4, which changed the agency’s approach to immigration enforcement related to U visa applicants. Among other things, this new directive eliminates proactive victim identification, so ICE officers are no longer required to look for clues or evidence suggesting a foreign national is a victim of a crime when making enforcement decisions.

“With the new Department of Homeland Security rules, these cases are being reopened. So people who were helping the police, who had suffered some type of crime, or were victims of a very serious crime are now in deportation proceedings,” immigration attorney Benjamín Osorio said.

One such case is that of Fredy Hernández Cedillos, a Salvadoran immigrant who has lived in the U.S. since 2009. He was injured during a violent robbery in Virginia in 2010 and has been waiting for a U visa since 2020.

""My lawyer received a letter from DHS saying they’re going to reopen our case, even though we’ve already gone to court. So our fear is that we can’t return to our country because gangs are after us. And we don’t know if we’ll have to leave our children,” said Cedillos.

U.S. law allows migrants applying for this visa to continue the visa process in the countries to which they were deported. However, lawyers like Osorio warn of the difficulties involved in this process.

“Yes, they can continue their procedures. But the problem is that if the waiting list is more than 10 years long, people have to spend that time in the country to which they were deported, and they are often in danger there. Furthermore, if they have American children, they will suffer without their parents, because deportation affects the entire family,” Osorio said.

'Harmed by these delays'

The prosecution of these cases made headlines in January, when a Michigan court ruled that a group of crime survivors applying for U visas could move forward with a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for unjustifiable delays in receiving initial good faith determinations, which, among other things, has prevented them from accessing work permits.

""We have several clients who have waited nearly six years without any updates or news, not even an initial acknowledgment of the legitimacy of their case. The court ruled that our clients have been harmed by these delays,” Meredith Luneack, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said in a statement. This case is still being reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

The Trump administration has demanded a drastic increase in the immigrant detentions and deportations, with a daily quota of 3,000 arrests. Shapiro, along with other experts, says this pressure has resulted in hundreds of people being detained while attending their immigration court appearances.

""You want to do things right and work in this country, but what I see is that the government wants to remove as many people as possible. The fear is going to court and, once we’re there, they won’t let us out,” Cedillos said.

Mendoza Méndez remains detained as he battles in court to stay in the U.S. With a broken voice, he said he hasn’t lost hope of returning to his family in Minnesota. ""I still have faith and I know we’ll be able to get through all of this,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-domingo-mendoza-vl-1014a-359c80.jpg",N,,2025-08-08 02:57:00.771970

""People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS,"" he wrote in a TruthSocial post.

It's unclear if Trump is trying to tweak the current plan for the 2030 census or start a new one altogether.

The White House and the U.S. Census Bureau did not immediately respond to Axios' requests for comment.

Reality check: The Constitution laid out the Founding Fathers' vision for the census and how populations were meant to be counted.

What the Constitution text says about the census

The Constitution's Article 1, Section 2 stipulated how the population would be counted, though it also featured the ""three-fifths compromise.""

The Constitution says the census should happen ""within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.""

How it works: The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be counted in the census.

""Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,"" the amendment reads.

The text gave the government a tool to help empower the people according to the United States Census Bureau.

""The plan was to count every person living in the newly created United States of America, and to use that count to determine representation in the Congress,"" the bureau says on its website.

Yes, but: There's debate about how the ""actual enumeration"" for the census is meant to happen. Some contend the language gives Congress a wide net for its methodology.

Who is included in census population counts?

Zoom in: The US Census Bureau says the resident population includes ""all people (citizens and noncitizens) who are living in the United States at the time of the census.""

""People are counted at their usual residence, which is the place where they live and sleep most of the time,"" the bureau explains.

The intrigue: Defenders of the census say the current process helps states represent and serve everyone in their state. But critics contend that the Constitution was written ""before tens of millions of migrants resided in the country illegally,"" according to Benjamin Weingarten of RealClearInvestigations.

Can Trump order a new census?

It's unclear. Trump said in his TruthSocial post Thursday that he urged the Department of Commerce to start working on a new census without specifics.

Preparing for the census count is an arduous process that can take several years of planning.

The Census Bureau has already started preparing a test census for 2026 and a rehearsal in 2028. ""This iterative approach will give the Census Bureau an evidence-based design for the 2030 Census,"" the bureau says.

Flashback: Trump floated a similar idea during his first term. He tried to erase unauthorized immigrants from population counts, while also moved to add a citizenship question a citizenship question to the census. The latter act was blocked by the Supreme Court.

Research from the Census Bureau says that questions about one's immigration status could lead to faulty self-reported data, which could mess with population totals.

Trump also signed a memo in 2020 that aimed to omit undocumented immigrants from the census count. A lower court deemed the policy unlawful. The Supreme Court later dismissed a lawsuit that challenged the Trump administration's plans.",https://images.axios.com/Ay2XhJsEBvYL44W7HyIsSUm9TI4=/0x115:5669x3304/1366x768/2025/08/07/1754577952976.jpeg,N,,2025-08-08 02:57:04.820570

In a social media post, Trump also called for an unprecedented exclusion of millions of people living in the U.S. without legal status.

The 14th Amendment requires the “whole number of persons in each state” to be included in a key set of census numbers used to determine how presidents and members of Congress are elected.

It’s unclear if Trump is referring to the regularly scheduled national head count in 2030 or an earlier tally.

Trump said he’s instructed the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to “immediately begin work” on a census using “the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.” It’s unclear why the election results would matter to the census.

The press offices for the White House, Commerce Department and Census Bureau did not immediately respond to NPR’s requests for comment.

While Article I of the Constitution has required a census every 10 years since 1790 for the once-a-decade redistribution of congressional seats, it’s not clear whether the results of a census taken years before 2030 can be used for reapportioning each state’s share of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and votes in the Electoral College.

Trump’s latest push renews similar efforts from his first administration that sparked legal battles. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately stopped a question about a person’s U.S. citizenship status from being added to 2020 census forms but declined to rule on whether people without legal status can be, for the first time in U.S. history, excluded by the president from apportionment counts.

Former President Joe Biden affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in the states in those tallies with a 2021 executive order, which Trump revoked on the first day of his second term.

Using the census to ask about a person’s immigration status has yet to be tested by the Census Bureau.

But research by the bureau shows that using the once-a-decade tally by the federal government to ask the question “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” is likely to produce faulty self-reported data and discourage many households with Latino or Asian American residents from getting tallied in official population totals, which are also used for dividing up trillions in federal funding for public services in communities across the country.

The bureau’s researchers have also warned that attempting to produce neighborhood-block level citizenship data with a new census question would be “very costly,” harm the quality of other demographic statistics the census produces and yield “substantially less accurate” data than information available from existing government records about people’s citizenship status.

The Supreme Court found the first Trump administration’s stated justification for a census citizenship question — to better enforce the voting rights of racial minority groups — appeared “contrived.” As a result, Trump issued a 2019 executive order that spelled out other reasons for producing citizenship data that would be more detailed than the estimates the bureau already releases.

They included informing immigration policy and eligibility rules for public benefits, and coming up with a count of people in the U.S. without legal status. Another reason the order outlined was allowing state and local governments to draw voting districts that do not account for children and non-U.S. citizens. That radical departure from current standard redistricting practices would be “advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,” a 2015 report by a Republican redistricting strategist concluded. Its legality is an open question before the Supreme Court.

A 2020 presidential memorandum ultimately confirmed another goal for Trump’s first push for a citizenship question — data that would allow for the unprecedented exclusion of immigrants in the U.S. without legal status from what are known as the congressional apportionment counts.

Trump’s call for a new census comes amid growing support among Republican members of Congress in recent years to use the next decennial head count to tally non-U.S. citizens living in the country and then subtract some or all of those residents from the apportionment counts.

The action also follows sweeping executive orders by Trump aiming to curb illegal immigration and expand requirements for proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.

The Trump administration’s latest push to change the census is expected to be challenged with lawsuits.

Additionally, if Trump is referring to the 2030 census, legal experts say that Trump’s successor or Congress may — in 2029 — have an opportunity to get rid of any added question about a person’s immigration status before it’s printed on paper forms for the 2030 census.The Trump administration’s renewed focus on excluding U.S. residents without legal status from the census, however, could fuel public reluctance to participate in the national count, particularly among immigrant communities and Latinos.

While officials in the first Trump administration often emphasized that some past national head counts have asked about people’s U.S. citizenship status in some way, census records going back to 1820 show that Trump’s proposal bucks centuries of precedent. The federal government has never before used the census to directly ask for the citizenship status of every person living in every household in the United States.

The Trump administration has rescinded guidelines that previously limited immigration enforcement actions at what were considered sensitive areas, including schools.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested a parent outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista Wednesday morning as families dropped off students for the school day, according to the school district.

The arrest happened just weeks into the new school year on a “public roadway” near Enrique S. Camarena Elementary school in east Chula Vista, Giovanna Castro, a spokesperson for Chula Vista Elementary School District, told inewsource.

Immigration officials have been accelerating arrests in recent weeks under President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda. Earlier this year, his administration rolled back a policy that once limited ICE activity at schools and other sensitive locations.

Multiple district officials said this was the first they’ve heard of ICE activity around Chula Vista schools.

The district’s superintendent, Eduardo Reyes, sent an email to parents notifying them of the arrest and the district’s policy for handling interactions with law enforcement.

“We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces,” Reyes said in the letter.

ICE officials did not immediately respond to questions from inewsource about the person who was arrested and whether officers had a warrant.

By Wednesday afternoon, news of the arrest had reached some parents who came to pick up their children from school. Most who talked to inewsource said they were surprised to hear of the arrest. Some expressed more concern about the incident.

One grandparent who did not want to be named said he felt “sorry” for the family of the person arrested.

“You come to drop off your kids at school and it could be the last day,” he said.

Another parent of two Camarena students who was pushing a stroller into school that afternoon said she was scared by the news. She said she is a U.S. citizen, but she’s worried about immigration officials stopping her because she is Mexican.

Zach Rhoads, who came to pick up his son that afternoon, read the email from the superintendent aloud to his wife earlier in the day. He said he was encouraged by the district’s response and that the arrest didn’t happen inside the school campus.

Rhoads isn’t worried about immigration enforcement affecting his family, but said “we definitely feel for the people that do have to go through that.”

ICE officials in San Diego have been increasing arrests recently, mostly of people who have no criminal records, only immigration violations.

Wednesday’s arrest wasn’t the first ICE incident near a school in San Diego County recently.

In June, two parents returning home after dropping off their child at Laurel Elementary in Oceanside were pulled over by ICE officials in SUVs. The father was handcuffed and arrested, Voice of San Diego reported.

Immigration advocates have criticized Trump’s rollback of the sensitive locations policy, saying it will lead parents fearful of immigration enforcement to keep their kids home from school.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta released guidance earlier this year for schools to prepare for potential immigration enforcement on campuses. School districts across the country have released their own policies for handling interactions and requests from immigration officials and pledged to keep their schools safe for students.

“The Chula Vista Elementary School District is committed to supporting every student, regardless of immigration status, and our highest priorities are our students’ safety, education, and well-being,” Castro wrote in an email to inewsource.",https://inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_8798-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 07:57:15.374554

Reassigning employees from FEMA who likely have no experience with immigration enforcement appears to be yet another attempt to bolster the ICE head count.","A number of employees with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) were informed via email late on Tuesday that they have been reassigned, effective immediately, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The workers had seven days to accept the reassignment, under threat of being removed from the civil service.

According to sources familiar with the matter, those reassigned were probationary employees with less than one year at FEMA, who because of presumed weaker civil service protections were fired early in the Trump administration but reinstated after a court order. Like at many federal agencies, these employees had been on paid administrative leave for months, among the over 100,000 men and women across the federal government who have been collecting a salary yet doing no work.

But now, these probationary FEMA employees on leave are apparently being shifted as a stopgap maneuver to bolster the ranks of ICE, which received tens of billions of dollars in the GOP mega-bill but faces the daunting task of hiring thousands of new agents to an unpopular agency with plummeting morale.

More from David Dayen

The Prospect reviewed an email from Sara Birchenough, an acting division director in staffing at the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. The email, with the subject line “Management Directed Reassignment Effective August 5, 2025,” notified recipients that they would be reassigned to ICE “due to the mission requirements of the Department.” The Department refers to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); both FEMA and ICE are under its umbrella.

It’s unclear how many employees were reassigned from FEMA in this manner and exactly how they would serve. Employees were told that the position description would be explained to them separately. They were given seven calendar days from receipt of the letter to accept or decline the appointment; a non-response would be considered acceptance. “If you choose to decline this reassignment, or accept but fail to report for duty, you may be subject to removal from Federal service as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 7513,” the email reads, referring to a portion of the U.S. Code.

In a statement, a DHS spokesperson told the Prospect, “Under President Trump’s leadership and through the One Big Beautiful Bill, DHS is adopting an all-hands-on-deck strategy to recruit 10,000 new ICE agents. To support this effort, select FEMA employees will temporarily be detailed to ICE for 90 days to assist with hiring and vetting. Their deployment will NOT disrupt FEMA’s critical operations. FEMA remains fully prepared for Hurricane Season. Patriotic Americans are encouraged to apply at join.ice.gov.”

Under federal rules, executive branch agencies do have the authority to involuntarily reassign employees within departments, as long as the employee gets notice and has the ability to reject the reassignment. Removal is allowable as a disciplinary measure for rejecting a reassignment.

AFGE Local 4060, the union local for FEMA employees, could not be reached for comment.

Reassigning dormant employees to ICE in particular signals how difficult it has been to add employees to an agency tasked with controversial abductions throughout the country.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act more than tripled ICE’s budget, allowing for the hiring of up to 10,000 new agents. But experts immediately questioned how successful this effort would be. In Trump’s first term, a proposed hiring surge failed to come close to reaching its goals. There’s less margin for error this time, with White House officials making brutal demands to round up, detain, and deport millions of people living in the country.

Since the law’s passage, ICE has advertised hiring terms that look increasingly desperate. It has offered signing bonuses as high as $50,000 as part of a program to lure back recent retirees. It has dangled student loan forgiveness and generous repayment plans for new recruits, while tightening student loan options for everyone else. It briefly offered cash bonuses to agents for rapid deportations before canceling the proposal.

Reassigning employees from FEMA who likely have no experience with immigration enforcement appears to be yet another attempt to bolster the ICE head count. If their task is to assist with hiring and vetting, as DHS says, it suggests a deficit of human resources professionals to vet new ICE agents. But the workers coming from FEMA are not necessarily trained in human resources, particularly in vetting agents who go out into the field for immigration operations.

A rushed process to boost staffing levels by any means necessary is likely to lead to relaxed hiring standards and improper practices. Already, American citizens have been detained and deported, numerous human rights violations have been alleged, and several detainees have died in custody.

The number of migrants being placed in removal proceeds has been increasing over the last five years, but will like see larger numbers in fiscal year 2025.

Immigration courts across the United States have been in a crisis for over a decade, research shows. This comes as the number of cases reaches nearly 4 million.

The number of immigrants appearing for their immigration court hearings in El Paso is declining, courthouse observers said.

Sister Leticia Gutiérrez, the director of the Diocese of El Paso's immigrant hospitality ministry, has been visiting the immigration court in the Richard C. White Federal Building as an observer since late May. She began just after masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began arresting immigrants upon leaving the courtroom, but in the last month she said that the number of migrants appearing is declining.

""The first day we arrived, the room was full of people for their court hearing, but since then, the presence of immigrants has been declining,"" Gutiérrez said. ""I don't know if it is because people are no longer following their process out of fear, because it is always difficult to proceed. But the truth is that every day ICE agents come.""

The migrants are either choosing to appear digitally or are not appearing at all out of fear of being detained for expedited removal after the judge dismisses their case.

She documented only three of 28 immigrants with appointments on July 30 who arrived for their morning hearings. The day prior, four of the sixteen immigrants appeared, with two appearing online and only two appearing physically.

The El Paso Times also observed a near-empty waiting room in the immigration court. Of 30 individual cases, only seven appeared for their afternoon hearing on June 25.

This trend has been increasing as news spreads about ICE officers arresting immigrants following their hearings as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to ramp up arrest numbers and deportations.

In some cases, federal lawyers ask immigration judges to dismiss migrants' cases, and then ICE agents apprehend migrants as they leave courtrooms and transport them for deportation.

At least 83% majority of immigrants historically appeared for their hearings, according to research. These numbers increase to 93% if they have a lawyer representing them.

But the current uptick is likely attributed to the high-profile arrests, but also to a lack of communication from the court, Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, said.

""Arrests are deterring people,"" Bush-Joseph said. ""But also I think the lack of information and the overwhelmed DHS and immigration courts are also contributing (to people not showing up).""

Increasing 'in abstentia' removal orders

The number of ""in absentia"" removal orders — which are deportation orders issued if a migrant fails to appear for their hearing — has been increasing since 2022, with 62,791 orders being issued that fiscal year. Two years later, the number increased to 222,921 orders in fiscal year 2024, which ended Sept. 31, 2024, according to data from the U.S. Department of Justice.

'In absentia' orders have increased in fiscal year 2025, with 133,223 removal orders issued between October 2024 and March 2025. The number of orders in the third quarter of 2025 will likely be higher, Bush-Joseph said.

""Even under Biden, we were issuing record numbers,"" Bush-Joseph said, ""and they are on track to issue even more this fiscal year.""

The majority of the immigrants arriving at the El Paso immigration court lack legal counsel.

A crisis in immigration courts

The U.S. immigration court has faced a crisis over the last decade, seeing massive backlogs of cases, limited legal counsel for migrants and insufficient staffing. The Migration Policy Institute found in a 2023 report that the crisis has grown worse during the first Trump administration.

There were 1,979,313 pending immigration cases as of April 2023, according to the Department of Justice. Two years later, there were 3,923,439 pending immigration cases.

""The crisis at the immigration courts means that the system doesn't work well for anyone,"" Bush-Joseph said. ""It doesn't work for the judges who are under a lot of pressure to be quickly deciding these really complex cases, and it doesn't work for immigrants who are trying to navigate this extremely complex system.""

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" does little to ease the pressure on the courts, Bush-Joseph points out. The new law, which was approved by congressional Republicans in July, provides billions for the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement and deportations, but it caps the number of immigration judges at 800 and does not provide any more funding for the courts.

The Trump administration has removed judges as the administration seeks to carry out its expedited deportation policy. It is estimated that the courts would require 1,300 judges for at least 10 years to process the current backlog.

Lawsuits against ICE courthouse arrests

As immigrants have slowly stopped appearing for their hearings, courthouse arrests by ICE officers have continued. Ten immigrants were arrested during the afternoon hearings on July 31, Gutiérrez said.

But immigrant rights groups are seeking to block this rapid removal of immigrants following their hearings.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, UndocuBlack Network and CASA filed a lawsuit against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on June 11. The lawsuit was included in a previous complaint that looks to stop the stripping the parole that was granted to Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

The San Antonio-based RAICES, the National Immigrant Justice Center and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area filed another lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for courthouse arrests on July 16. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a dozen individuals who were detained across the country after they were arrested by ICE officers after their hearings were dismissed.

The arrests have generated fears for immigrants with hearings, as courthouse observers have noticed. It has driven them underground in attempts to avoid arrest and expedited removal.

""They are becoming more and more invisible,"" Gutiérrez said. ""They are remaining in an irregular siutation, which comes with a lot of disadvantages. It is a very big concern when it comes to families with children.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/05/PTX1/84053512007-i-ce-in-el-paso-1779.JPG?crop=3499,1968,x0,y182&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-07 04:57:00.806618

The BIA added that a social group defined by sex and nationality also fails to meet the PSG definition.
U.S. asylum law is based on the United Nations’ guidelines for refugee programs.
This three-part test is supposed to distinguish between social groups that are like race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, and social groups that are unlike asylum law’s other protected groups.
Nevertheless, to gain asylum in an immigration court or with an asylum officer, victims of gendered violence will now have to prove a more specific reason for their suffering.","A new decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) will make it harder for people fleeing gender-based violence to gain asylum in the United States.

On July 18, the BIA published its decision in Matter of K-E-S-G-, finding that people persecuted solely on account of their sex are unlikely to qualify for asylum because sex alone does not meet the definition of a particular social group (PSG), one of the five categories protected from persecution under U.S. asylum law. The BIA added that a social group defined by sex and nationality also fails to meet the PSG definition.

The case involved the asylum application of Ms. S.G., a woman who fled El Salvador for the United States after she was stalked and threatened by gang members in her community. Like many women who flee gender-based violence, she feared returning to El Salvador because of the persecution she suffered, and because her government would not protect her.

U.S. asylum law is based on the United Nations’ guidelines for refugee programs. When these guidelines were created in 1951, member states had just emerged from the horrors of the Holocaust. It is no surprise that they focused on protecting people persecuted for their race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.

However, the United Nations’ guidelines also included a broad term, PSG, to describe people persecuted on account of an identity that did not fit into, but was similar to, the listed categories. After all, societies classify people in different ways over time, so no list could account for all the ways humans target each other for persecution.

Which groups of people meet the PSG definition — and which don’t — has been the subject of debate ever since, particularly when it comes to victims of domestic violence.

To gain asylum in the United States, a noncitizen like Ms. S.G. must show she is part of a listed protected category — race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a PSG — or that other people around her think she belongs to one of these protected groups. The immigration court or asylum officer then assesses whether the harm the noncitizen suffered, or fears, is “on account of” her protected group membership, and assesses a number of other factors.

If an asylum applicant claims membership in a PSG, she must prove that her PSG meets three criteria. Since 2014, the BIA has defined a PSG as a group of people who share a common characteristic they cannot, or should not, have to change (an immutable trait). The group must have defined boundaries (particularity), and others in the same society must view the group as set apart from the rest of the population (social distinction). This three-part test is supposed to distinguish between social groups that are like race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, and social groups that are unlike asylum law’s other protected groups.

In Matter of K-E-S-G-, the BIA decided that sex fails this three-part test. Even though it found that sex is an immutable trait, the BIA ruled that the PSGs comprised of “women” or “Salvadoran women” lack particularity because these groups are too diverse and have no unifying characteristic that unites their experiences. In particular, the BIA argued that women “encompass[] a diverse cross section of society of widely varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, marital statuses, family backgrounds, and lifestyles.”

But this justificationis troubling since racial, religious, national, and political groups also contain diverse cross-sections of society. Furthermore, the idea that women encompass a diverse cross section of society may be true in some cultures, but certainly does not apply where cultural norms punish women for straying outside expected behavior and block women from accessing specific parts of society, such as positions of religious, economic, and political authority. Nevertheless, K-E-S-G- states that “[g]roups defined solely by the characteristics of sex and nationality contain no narrowing features” — regardless of context.

The BIA also reasoned that if it were to decide that sex is a PSG in Ms. S.G.’s case, it would improperly create a new protected ground in asylum law, contrary to the intent of Congress. However, the BIA itself previously noted that an asylum applicant who seeks protection based on membership in a PSG must prove the existence of her PSG using information about her own social context. Before K-E-S-G-, for example, the BIA found that whether or not “married women in Guatemala unable to leave their relationship” was a PSG depended on “the facts and evidence in each individual case” because “any claim regarding the existence of a particular social group in a country must be evaluated in the context of the evidence presented regarding the particular circumstances in the country in question.”

The BIA also justified its ruling by stating that the U.N. didn’t think about sex when it created its refugee guidelines. But the PSG category often is used to capture categories of persecuted people the U.N. failed to anticipate. The K-E-S-G- decision approvingly cites other PSGs the U.N. drafters certainly did not consider, such as the gay community and victims of female genital cutting.

Importantly, as the BIA acknowledged in its K-E-S-G- decision, some circuit courts have previously expressed skepticism about prior BIA decisions finding that PSGs defined by sex and nationality are too broad and thus lack particularity. Under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright, courts need not defer to the BIA’s interpretations of the asylum statute. Advocates whose clients are denied asylum based on K-E-S-G- and ordered removed can therefore argue in petitions for review that the agency reading of the statute warrants no deference, and instead argue for an interpretation of “particular social group” that accords with the plain text, statutory context, legislative history and purpose, and any prior helpful circuit case law.

Nevertheless, to gain asylum in an immigration court or with an asylum officer, victims of gendered violence will now have to prove a more specific reason for their suffering. For example, a Salvadoran woman fleeing an abusive partner will no longer be granted asylum at this level based on her status as a Salvadoran woman, despite El Salvador’s status as the country with the world’s highest rate of intentional female homicides. But if she can show she’s being targeted as a single mother, and that single mothers are a distinct group in Salvadoran society, her asylum claim still has a chance. As a result, people fleeing gender-based violence are placed in a precarious position where they have to explain why they were targeted for persecution in more detail than their neighbor’s fleeing on account of other protected grounds.

The BIA’s decision in Matter of K-E-S-G- gives asylum seekers persecuted on account of their gender an uphill climb, and their advocates now have a great deal of work cut out for them in an environment where more is demanded of them.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-kesg-gender-violence-asylum.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:08.646948

The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.
This prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs.","In a key win for immigrant rights organizations, a California Court of Appeal ruled that the University of California has not provided sufficient legal grounds to justify its “discriminatory policy” barring the hiring of undocumented students from on-campus jobs.

A UCLA alumnus and a lecturer filed a lawsuit in October arguing that the UC system’s hiring policy violates state law because it discriminates against students based on their immigration status.

Plaintiffs said that, without access to campus jobs, many undocumented students struggle to meet tuition costs and cover basic needs such as housing and food. These students are often forced into the underground economy and miss out on career-advancing opportunities such as research assistant positions.

Attorneys representing the UC system argued that its policy is justified because hiring undocumented students could run afoul of a federal law that bans the hiring of people without legal status and may provoke retaliation from the federal government.

A three-judge panel, however, ruled that the system’s policy violates California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act and that fear of federal litigation is not sufficient grounds to uphold it.

“The University does not assert that it relied on the requirements of a federal statute or regulation in deciding to not to amend its policy — only on the risks associated with adopting a policy that the federal government might consider unlawful,” states the ruling. “Accordingly, we conclude that the University abused its discretion by relying on an improper justification for continued application of its facially discriminatory policy.”

The panel stopped short of ruling that UC must overturn its policy; rather, it ordered that the university system reconsider the policy based on proper legal criteria.

Attorneys representing the plaintiffs consider the ruling a victory and are calling on UC to open jobs to undocumented students.

“The court’s powerful opinion rejects the UC’s attempt to justify its policy discriminating against undocumented students. It is wrong — both morally and legally — to bar our state’s most talented students from access to crucial educational employment opportunities based on their immigration status,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of UCLA’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, in a statement. “We call on the UC to comply with state law and treat all its students equally, regardless of immigration status.”

The UC system said it is reviewing the court’s ruling but has not commented on whether it will change its hiring policy.

“To the extent it’s compliant with the law, the University continues to believe undocumented students deserve the same opportunities as our other students,” said UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook in a statement.

University officials have previously expressed fear that changing the system’s hiring policy could result in civil fines, criminal penalties and the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal funding. Last week, the Trump administration announced it was freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding to UCLA, citing concerns over antisemitism and the university’s handling of pro-Palestinian protests.

Tuesday’s court ruling comes after a years-long push to open campus jobs to students lacking documentation.

The debate over whether it is legal to do so revolves around the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which bars the hiring of people without legal status.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that this federal law does not apply to government employers such as the UC system. Attorneys representing UC did not argue that the IRCA applies to public universities but said that the federal government might believe it does.

In Tuesday’s ruling, the three-judge panel noted that UC had the option to file a lawsuit against the federal government to secure a court ruling on whether the university system is subject to the IRCA.

Under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy — better known as DACA — undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children could get work permits. The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.

President Trump, however, terminated the DACA program in 2017, and although courts have challenged that decision, the program is no longer accepting new applicants.

There are now around 64,300 undocumented college students who are not eligible for DACA in California and, therefore, not eligible for work authorization — or campus jobs.

“As someone who was undocumented and a UC lecturer, I know firsthand the transformative power of on-campus work opportunities,” said plaintiff Iliana G. Perez in a statement on the court ruling. “UC must now act with urgency to dismantle exclusionary policies and ensure all students, regardless of immigration status, can fully participate in their education, contribute to their campuses, and shape California’s future.”

Students and faculty began advocating for the UC system to open jobs to all students regardless of their immigration status in 2022.

The UC regents established a working group to consider change its hiring policy in 2023, but the group suspended its work due to fear that doing so would violate the IRCA.

A year later, the California Legislature passed the Opportunity for All Act, requiring state public universities to open up employment to all students, but Newsom vetoed the bill, citing legal concerns over the IRCA.

This prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs. A court initially denied this request, but the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court, which then ordered the state Court of Appeal to rule on the merits of the case.

As with their previous earnings call, GEO Group had much to celebrate. Notably, Zoley has donated thousands of dollars to Republican candidates and PACs, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has defended Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda at every turn, is a former GEO Group lobbyist.

“Congrats on the quarter and all the positive news” and the “fantastic growth opportunities ahead of us,” one participant told executives during the question and answer session.

For the second quarter of 2025, GEO Group reported total revenues of $636.2 million compared with $607.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, although the company’s expenses increased by approximately 7 percent. The company’s net debt totals approximately $1.7 billion, compared with $1.68 billion in debt at the end of the first quarter of 2025.

“We have increased our budget to approximately $100 million in physical plant and technology improvements to better position GEO in responding to ICE’s expanding needs,” said GEO Group CFO Mark J. Suchinski.

The Trump administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda has meant lucrative contracts for GEO Group. The company is under contract for approximately 20,000 beds at 21 facilities, “the highest level of ICE utilization in our company’s history,” Zoley said. The company’s contracts represent “more than one-third of the current ICE detention levels, which we estimate to be approximately 57,000 beds nationwide.”

In 2024 alone, Zoley contributed more than $150,000 dollars to Republican candidates and causes, including Trump, the Republican National Committee, and Republican PACs, according to Truthout’s analysis of Open Secrets data.

Since January, GEO Group has entered into government contracts for an 1,800-bed immigration jail in Baldwin, Michigan, and a 1,000-bed immigration jail in Newark, New Jersey, which are expected to bring in more than $85 million and $60 million in annual revenues, respectively. In June, the company announced that it was reopening a lock-up in Georgia that can hold more than 1,800 people and, when operating at full occupancy, is expected to generate approximately $66 million in annual revenue. GEO Group also announced that month that it had entered into a five-year contract with the U.S. Marshals Service to provide transportation services across 14 states. The contract is expected to bring in approximately $29 million in annual revenue.

Zoley said that the Trump administration’s plan to detain people on military bases is another potential source of revenue for the company, and that they’re identifying “existing ICE facilities where we can add approximately 5,000 combined beds using temporary and permanent facilities.”

“All of these efforts are aimed at placing our company in the best competitive position possible to pursue what we continue to believe are unprecedented growth opportunities as a long standing support services provider for ICE with a 40 year long track record,” he said.

GEO Group also expects to profit from increased electronic monitoring of immigrants.

“We’ve stocked up the inventory of our monitoring devices, and are well-positioned to scale up the use of GPS tracking for non detained illegal aliens once the ICE detention capacity has been maximized,” Zoley said.

In July, GEO Group gave raises to Zoley and the company’s CEO. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company wrote that it had approved increasing the target bonus and target stock award from 100 percent to 150 percent of their base salary, in part because of the “unprecedented business opportunities that the Company is experiencing.” The chair’s base salary is $1.1 million, while the CEO’s is $1 million.

That good fortune comes at the expense of the thousands of people locked up in GEO Group’s immigration jails. The company has been repeatedly accused of detaining people in inhumane conditions. People imprisoned at Delaney Hall, the lock-up in Newark, New Jersey, have reported that they’re denied food, access to clean water, medication and visits with their family.

José Pineda's attorneys have filed a complaint letter with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement recounting his ordeal. The letter is a required precursor to filing a lawsuit.

Pineda's attorneys say there's no clear explanation as to why he was pulled over and held, despite having on his person paperwork showing his right to be in the U.S.

"" It seems like the only reason why they actually did this is because of their racial animus and because he looked like a Latino man,"" Pineda's attorney, Victoria Miranda, said.

Pineda, 61, was born in El Salvador and has spent the last 30 years in the U.S. He is here under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, according to Lawyers for Civil Rights, who are representing him. That humanitarian status gives Pineda and other TPS holders the right to live and work in the U.S.

Despite that, on May 27 while Pineda was driving in Weymouth to a landscaping job in a company vehicle, he was stopped by ICE, according to the complaint letter. Five armed officers surrounded the vehicle. Pineda explained he was legally authorized to be in the U.S. and presented his driver's license to an officer.

""The same officer then disrespectfully and incorrectly insulted Mr. Pineda in both English and Spanish, saying that if someone was not born in the United States, they do not have any rights,"" the complaint states.

Pineda was arrested, cuffed and taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, a site that other detainees have called ""abysmal"" and ""inhumane."" WBUR has reported that the Burlington office, which was designed to hold people for just a few hours, has been used to hold some people for days or for more than a week.

Pineda was held in Burlington for 36 hours before he was released. During that time, he said he was kept in an overcrowded room with 40 to 60 people and only a small sink and one toilet. According to the complaint, Pineda had to stand for most of his time there and there was no room to lie down to sleep.

""This is someone who has been complying for 30 years and simply got pulled over, arrested, chained, cuffed, brought to a facility with inhumane conditions for no reason at all,"" his attorney, Miranda, said.

ICE officers confiscated Pineda's license, social security card, employment authorization card and credit card. The also seized $600 in cash, which was not returned, according to the complaint letter.

ICE declined to comment on Pineda's complaint.

In June, Lawyers for Civil Rights filed a similar complaint letter to DHS and ICE for a Chelsea family. Federal agents smashed he window of the family's vehicle and pulled Daniel Flores-Martinez out of the car in front of his wife and children on the way to church.

Miranda said Pineda had to ""succumb"" in the moment to ICE agents, despite his legal status. But she hopes other immigrants worried about similar stops will know their rights and be able to state them to authorities.

Perhaps, she said, ""immigration enforcement will get the message that this type of practice is not okay.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0716_burlingtonice-3-1-1000x530.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:34.176465

Germany has its own list of safe countries of origin.
In the future, safe countries of origin are to be determined by decree.
She added that the plan to classify safe countries of origin by means of a legal directive without oversight by the Bundestag and Bundesrat is not possible.
Classifying these countries as safe would conflict with a key criterion established by the European Court of Justice's ruling: countries deemed safe third countries must ensure the safety of their entire population.","Safe countries of origin are those whose citizens do not have to fear state persecution, according to assessments by the German government or the European Union. Whether such assessments are accurate is a matter for debate that often ends up in court.

Last week, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that EU countries are allowed to designate safe countries of origin to fast-track asylum procedures if authorities disclose the sources for their assessment. The court also found that for a country to be designated as safe, it must offer adequate protection to the entire population, including minorities.

The Luxembourg-based court also said that while having a fast-track procedure does not violate EU law, the designation of safe countries must be subject to judicial scrutiny so migrants can challenge decisions made on their asylum claims.

Germany has its own list of safe countries of origin. Asylum seekers from these countries hardly stand a chance of being granted asylum in Germany. Currently, eight European non-EU and two African countries are on this list.

Safe country candidates: Algeria, India, Morocco, Tunisia

The new German coalition government of center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) had agreed to add more countries to the list. ""We are continuously assessing whether more countries meet the requirements. In particular, a country will be classified as safe if fewer than 5% of asylum seekers from that country have been accepted over at least a five-year period.""

It remains to be seen whether these plans will be as easy to implement as it sounds in the coalition agreement following the ECJ ruling. A spokesperson for the interior ministry, which is responsible for asylum policy, said that the ruling will be reviewed.

Yet the German government still intends to reform the process for determining whether a country of origin is safe. In the future, safe countries of origin are to be determined by decree. This would mean that neither the Bundestag nor the Bundesrat (the upper house of parliament representing the 16 federal states) would have a say in the matter.

Interior Minister calls for reform to asylum law

The coalition has already submitted a draft bill on this issue, which is to be voted on after the parliament's summer recess. The first debate already took place last July. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt took that opportunity to criticize what he sees as an insufficient number of deportations of rejected asylum seekers: ""Our goal now is to remove the obstacles to effectively limiting illegal migration,"" he said.

One such obstacle that the CSU politician highlighted was the fact that, under current law, people who have been ordered to leave the country are entitled to legal representation before their planned deportation can be enforced. This is one of the regulations that is to be abolished. Dobrindt hopes that this will also speed up deportations to countries already listed as safe.

Within the European Union, there are already discussions about setting up joint centers for the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers. The interior ministers of EU member states discussed this at their meeting in Copenhagen last July.

This is an idea that Dobrindt is in favor of. He pointed out that it can be difficult for individual member states to reach deals with non-EU countries, while it could be more expedient when several EU countries work together. Several countries already have concrete plans in place. ""I wouldn't rule this out for Germany either,"" said the German interior minister.

'Those who cannot stay should not come in the first place'

In Dobrindt's view, many of the people who came to Germany in the past were not eligible for asylum. He hopes that the planned reform will send a clear message: ""People who come from a safe country of origin should not make the journey. Those who cannot stay should not come in the first place.""

Some members of the political opposition in Germany hope that the European Court of Justice's ruling will force the federal government to change its course on asylum policy.

""The ECJ ruling on safe countries of origin is a major success for human rights and the individual right to asylum in Europe,"" said Green Party MP Filiz Polat. She added that the plan to classify safe countries of origin by means of a legal directive without oversight by the Bundestag and Bundesrat is not possible.

The Left Party: Georgia and Moldova are not safe third countries

Clara Bünger of the Left Party has also called on the governing coalition to carry out a comprehensive review of the list of safe countries of origin.""Georgia and Moldova should be removed from this list immediately.

The reason given was the precarious human rights situation in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Also, the EU member state Czechia considers only parts of Moldova as safe, while the Transnistria region is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and therefore considered unsafe.

The ECJ ruling, according to Bünger, ""also represents a clear repudiation of the federal government's plans to classify other countries, such as Tunisia and Algeria, as safe.""

Same-sex sexual relations are punishable by law in both Tunisia and Algeria. Classifying these countries as safe would conflict with a key criterion established by the European Court of Justice's ruling: countries deemed safe third countries must ensure the safety of their entire population.

The lawsuit, filed at a federal court in California, represents the latest legal challenge to two provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that have been key to the State and Homeland Security Departments’ so-called ideological deportation policy. In several other cases brought around the country, judges have also been asked to weigh the constitutionality of the INA provisions and the administration’s policy around them.

The California case was brought by the organization that publishes The Stanford Daily and two noncitizen former college students who fear their pro-Palestinian views or advocacy could put them at risk of being deported. Attorneys for the newspaper said in the lawsuit that international students on staff are turning down assignments related to the war in Gaza or “seeking removal of their previous articles about it.”

“Since the Trump administration began targeting lawfully present noncitizens for deportation based on protected speech in March 2025, lawfully present noncitizen students working at and contributing to Stanford Daily have self-censored expression for fear of visa revocation, arrest, detention, and deportation,” attorneys from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which brought the new case, wrote in court papers.

One of the INA provisions at issue gives Secretary of State Marco Rubio the authority to decide that a noncitizen is removable if he “personally determines” that the individual’s views “would compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” The other gives the secretary the power to “at any time, in his discretion” revoke a visa.

The Stanford Daily and the two unnamed former students are asking a federal judge to bar the administration from using the pair of provisions to deport them and any noncitizen members of the newspaper’s staff based on their “protected speech.”

“The First Amendment cements America’s promise that the government may not subject a speaker to disfavored treatment because those in power do not like his or her message. And when a federal statute collides with First Amendment rights, the Constitution prevails,” the attorneys wrote.

The lawsuit comes on the heels of a weekslong bench trial in a separate case in Boston during which members of the Trump administration testified under oath about the government’s targeting of noncitizen pro-Palestinian students and scholars.

The trial, which concluded on July 21, highlighted how DHS began taking orders from the State Department as it went after certain professors and students to change their immigration status and work to have them deported. US District Judge William Young, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, is now deciding whether the government’s “ideological deportation policy” had the effect of unlawfully chilling the speech of certain professors.

Hundreds of migrants departed from Chiapas state in southeastern Mexico on Wednesday with the intention of reaching the nation’s capital, Mexico City, to settle there.

As foreigners and asylum seekers continue to be turned away under US border and immigration policies, many migrants now see Mexico as a destination rather than just a transit country.

Local reports estimate the caravan at around 300 people, primarily from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The group departed from Tapachula -- a city on Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala that has become a key point in hemispheric migration.

Unlike previous caravans, the newly formed group aims to reach Mexico City rather than the northern border as US President Donald Trump continues his crusade against immigrants.

Speaking to Anadolu, Gabriela Hernandez, the director of Casa Tochan -- a migrant shelter in Mexico City – explained the reason for the shift in destination for many asylum seekers.

“Because Trump has been decisive. Not only did he remove the CBP One app, but he also toughened the entire process of migrating legally.

“Obviously, those coming in that caravan can't return to their countries, which is why they see Mexico as an option. Besides, we already know -- even if it’s kept under wraps -- that Mexico has been accepting deportees from the United States who aren’t even Mexican. So Mexico ends up with both those being returned and those trying to arrive,"" she said.

Beyond the dismantling of legal pathways such as CBP One -- the US Customs and Border Protection app launched during President Joe Biden’s administration to help migrants schedule asylum appointments -- the Trump administration has also resumed deporting non-Mexican migrants to Mexican territory.

“The Mexican government continues with its approach of ignoring migrants. In no speech or political discourse does it address foreign migration, as if it didn’t exist. This makes it clear that it won’t take them into account, which is the most serious issue for people who have no other option but to stay in Mexico,” Hernandez added.

Echoing the US government’s tough approach, Mexico has increasingly moved to restrict migration. In an effort to placate Trump’s threats of imposing tariffs, President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration has deployed large numbers of military troops to control both borders. Raids on migrant camps at key entry points such as Tapachula and Mexico City have also intensified.

The caravan itself has been targeted by these policies. Mexican authorities recently arrested Luis Garcia Villagran, a well-known human rights defender of immigrants and organizer of the caravan.

Villagran, who has been vocal in criticizing the Mexican government’s anti-immigrant stance, was detained by local police on Aug. 5 in Tapachula after announcing the caravan's formation.

Human rights groups and migrant advocacy organizations have condemned his arrest as part of a persistent pattern of criminalization against those who defend migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico.

“Civil society organizations, collectives and human rights defenders express our concern over a pattern of criminalization against those who defend and support migrants, as part of the growing crackdown on immigration worldwide,” said a joint statement by several civil organizations in response to Villagran’s arrest.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/08/07/thumbs_b_c_ae6e9f1e5fd6d7299f8e5bdc92077c2f.jpg?v=080609,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:57.531553

The department said in a news release that it would waive age limits for new applicants so “even more patriots will qualify to join ICE,” the agency responsible for finding, arresting, detaining and removing people who are in the U.S. illegally.

The agency is at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Earlier this summer Congress passed a spending bill that gives ICE money to hire 10,000 more staff.

The department said all recruits would have to go through medical and drug screening and complete a physical fitness test.

The agency promoted the age-limit changes on social media with enthusiastic tones, casting the immigration-enforcement efforts as not only patriotic but also epic and even cinematic.

One post was accompanied by an image that looked like a recruiting poster showing images of a young man and an older man, both wearing military style tactical gear and holding weapons with the words “NO AGE CAP JOIN ICE NOW” emblazoned on the bottom. “We’re taking father/son bonding to a whole new level,” it said.

Another showed an advertisement for a Ford Club Wagon — a large van once popular for how many people it could carry — with the words: “Think about how many criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy?”

Written at the bottom of the image was the words “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” Absolute boys is a slang term used to praise someone.

As part of that campaign the agency is offering an eye-catching bonus of up to $50,000 for new recruits as well as other benefits like student loan forgiveness and abundant overtime for deportation officers.

Until the laws are followed, environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams should issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. The suit claims the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration.

The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County.

A second lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 18.

The detention facility has ignored a review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act, and the lawsuit was meant to assert the public’s rights to make sure environmental harm does not occur, Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, testified in court Wednesday. Samples noted that her organization was founded in 1969 by environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas in response to a failed effort to build a massive airport in the same location.

An attorney for the state of Florida questioned Samples during cross examination about whether Friends of the Everglades had filed any lawsuits or taken legal action against the airport or its owner, Miami-Dade County, over the past decade. She acknowledged they had not.

“Victories are sometimes imperfect,” she said.

When the attorney asked Samples if she agreed with the political decision to detain and deport immigrants, the judge shut down the question, saying the trial would be limited to environmental issues.

Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center’s construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe.

It makes no difference that the detention center holding hundreds of detainees was built by the state of Florida since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the suit said.

“The construction of a detention center is an action that is necessarily subject to federal control and responsibility,” they said in a recent court filing. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.”

Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Judge Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Williams had yet to rule on that argument.

The lawsuits were being heard as Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.”

Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel. “The resolution of this case approved today should help to lead others engaged in discriminatory practices to cease that activity.”

As part of the agreement, preliminarily approved today, NuVision has agreed to create a settlement fund of $108,800 to compensate the class of immigrants affected by the challenged practice. NuVision has also ended the use of the challenged practice. The settlement is one of more than a dozen MALDEF has reached with financial institutions that deny services to DACA recipients and other immigrants because of their immigration status rather than their creditworthiness.

The settlement provides for $3,200 payments for each of the 34 class members. All class members are residents of California. NuVision must also pay attorneys’ fees and other costs.

“The court’s preliminary settlement approval represents a crucial step towards compensating class members and recognizing their harm,” said MALDEF attorney Luis Lozada. “Importantly, financial institutions are starting to promptly change their policies and practices, as well as resolve any lingering problems with us.”

In April 2023, Bautista Martinez applied for an auto loan from NuVision, based in Huntington Beach, California. According to the lawsuit, NuVision denied Bautista Martinez a $35,000 auto loan after giving initial approval to his application because he is not a permanent resident of the United States. As a DACA recipient, Bautista Martinez is authorized to work in the U.S. and possesses a Social Security number.

“This preliminary approval is a meaningful step toward justice, not just for me but for many others facing the same barriers,” said Bautista Martinez. “It reinforces that what happened was wrong and that financial institutions must be held accountable when they discriminate. I spoke up because I knew it wasn’t just about me, and I hope this shows others that no one should accept being denied what they’ve earned.”

The suit challenged NuVision’s denial of a loan to Bautista Martinez as a violation of Section 1981 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, immigration status, age, and other characteristics.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, Western Division.

NuVision is a federally insured, member-owned credit union serving 160,000 members in Alaska, Arizona, California, Washington, and Wyoming with $3.3 billion in assets.

Since 2017, MALDEF has filed 22 lawsuits challenging the policies of financial institutions that discriminate against immigrants.",https://www.maldef.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cropped-MALDEF_Mark_Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:30.216747

During Mr. Trump’s first term, immigration agents would separate families at the southern border as they crossed into the United States.
Now, with illegal crossings notably low, the Trump administration is focusing on immigrants who are in the United States and have been ordered to leave.
That means officials are under pressure to deport families quickly, or the United States would have to spend money and resources to track them.
For the families who are still in the United States — like Evgeny, Evgeniia, Mr. Snegir and their children — the path ahead is uncertain.","Evgeny and Evgeniia faced an excruciating choice.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers told the couple they could leave the United States with their child and return to their native Russia, which they had fled seeking political asylum. Or they could remain in immigration detention in the United States — but their 8-year-old son, Maksim, would be taken away and sent to a shelter for unaccompanied children.

In the end, they chose the agony of limbo in the United States over a return to a place where they saw no prospect for freedom or any future for their family.

“Interior separation is approved,” ICE officials concluded in writing after the couple insisted they could not return to Russia. The last time Evgeny and Evgeniia saw Maksim was on May 15, in a room at Kennedy International Airport in New York City, as ICE agents led them back to detention in New Jersey.

“A few days, right?” Maksim begged his parents that day. “A few days?”

The couple, who asked to be identified only by their first names out of fear for their family back in Russia, said they tried to keep their son calm. Maksim pleaded with his father, who told the boy what he wanted to hear. “I said, ‘Yes, yes, it will be just a few days,’” Evgeny said, recounting the moment in an interview.

Their case is an example of a little-known tactic the Trump administration is using to pressure undocumented immigrants to leave the United States. Officials have begun separating children from their families in small numbers across the country, in what appears to be a more targeted version of one of the most explosive policies of President Trump’s first term.

The New York Times has uncovered at least nine cases in which parents have been separated from their children after they refused to comply with deportation orders, according to internal government documents, case files and interviews.

The practice is not as widespread as the “zero tolerance” policy of Mr. Trump’s first term, when thousands of children were systematically taken from their parents as they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and sent to shelters and foster homes.

But the new cases suggest that the administration has decided to use family separation as a tool, at least in some instances, to persuade families to leave and to create a powerful deterrent for those who might come to the United States illegally.

“The parents had the right and the ability to depart the country as a family and willfully choose to not comply,” she said.

She denied that there was any new policy on family separations.

Previous administrations separated undocumented families for reasons including national security concerns, public safety and child endangerment. But Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations, said that previous administrations, to her knowledge, did not use the threat of family separation as leverage to get people to leave the country.

“I’m not aware of ICE previously using family separation as a consequence for failure to comply” with deportation orders, Ms. Trickler-McNulty said.

Instead, she said, past administrations typically would have released such families into the United States with ankle monitors to track them as they awaited court dates, a practice that has contributed to enormous backlogs in the immigration system.

The notion of choice touches on a key difference between the separations from the first Trump administration and now.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, immigration agents would separate families at the southern border as they crossed into the United States. Adults were criminally charged with illegally entering the country and imprisoned, while their children — some of them babies, just months old — were taken away.

The family separation policy was enormously divisive. Wrenching images of children being pried from the arms of their parents stirred global outrage, but administration officials argued privately that was the whole point — the policy was meant to deter people from making a dangerous and illegal journey.

Mr. Trump ultimately relented to pressure and ended the policy in 2018. The Biden administration later agreed to a settlement that blocked family separations at the border, with some exceptions, including if children were in danger.

Now, with illegal crossings notably low, the Trump administration is focusing on immigrants who are in the United States and have been ordered to leave.

The Trump administration insists that it is simply enforcing the law. Mr. Trump has made aggressive enforcement a key part of his deportation campaign and says the American people elected him in part to get tough on immigration.

“To be clear, refusing a judge’s deportation order is a crime,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “If law enforcement pulled an American citizen over with kids in the back seat and they chose to not comply with lawful orders, the parents would be arrested, and the children would be placed in safe custody.”

Still, deporting families has always been a struggle for presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic alike. Children, for the most part, cannot by law remain in federal custody for more than three weeks. That means officials are under pressure to deport families quickly, or the United States would have to spend money and resources to track them.

At that point, the deportation challenge only grows. ICE agents would have the difficult task of arresting people with established ties to communities, who had been working or going to school and building lives in the United States.

During the Biden administration, officials considered various ideas, including arresting one parent or fining families who refused to comply with deportation orders, although they never put those policies in place, a former U.S. official said.

Evgeniia, speaking through an interpreter from ICE detention, said her family traveled to the Mexican border in hopes of getting an appointment under a Biden-era program that allowed people to enter the United States at a port of entry after registering with a government app. Mr. Trump canceled that program on Jan. 20, so she and her husband decided that driving to a port of entry and asking for asylum was the only way to reach safety.

They were immediately put into detention.

The American Civil Liberties Union is investigating the legality of the separations, said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the group.

“That the Trump administration has found a new form of family separation is hardly surprising given they have yet to acknowledge the horrific harm caused by the original policy and are now blatantly breaching provisions of the settlement designed to provide relief to those abused families, many of whom to this day still remain separated,” he said.

The court settlement banning separations specifically referred to the practice at the southern border. Now, however, the separations are not happening at the border — they are happening inside the country, so there may be legal wiggle room.

In at least one of the cases, ICE officials wrote that the separation fell outside the scope of the settlement, saying there were no “implication/requirements” when it comes to the court case.

Ms. McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said immigrants were taking advantage of the system and in some cases creating a public disturbance.

“We have seen recently illegal alien families have started to use a tactic where they refuse to board a commercial flight, often lashing out and posing a threat to the safety of their own children,” she said. As a result, Ms. McLaughlin added, the authorities “must ensure the children are safe and not in harm’s way until the family can soon be removed from the country.”

Regarding the case of Evgeny and Evgeniia specifically, Ms. McLaughlin said the couple “were acting so disruptive and aggressive they endangered the child’s well-being.”

The couple denied those allegations, and there was no mention of such a disturbance in the internal case file describing the separation, which was obtained by The Times. The file says that “since there is no other option to enforce the removal order in a safe manner as a family unit, interior separation is approved.”

A separate document, a referral of Maksim’s case to the agency that oversees custody of unaccompanied migrant children, said, “Subject was separated from his family on 5/15/2025 due to his parent’s refusal to board an aircraft for removal from the United States in violation of US law.”

Evgeny said he was trying to save his son from a longer separation in Russia because of what he believed to be a sure prison sentence there.

“I was explaining to them, to the officers, that our lives are in danger and our livelihood would be in danger,” he said. “And at some point, I kind of lost my bearings and started to cry.”

“I was explaining that I could not be deported, because I will face grave danger in Russia,” he said.

The couple had crossed the border with another Russian family, Pavel Snegir and his 11-year-old son, Aleksandr. They, too, were hoping for political asylum in the United States after Mr. Snegir’s wife was locked up in Russia for her political views, he said.

But after several weeks in border custody together, Mr. Snegir and his son were transferred to ICE custody in May and taken to an airport in San Diego. There, he was told he could take Aleksandr to New York City for a court hearing.

But once they got to the airport, Mr. Snegir refused to board the plane, having become convinced that he would be deported to Russia once he got to New York. Later that day, after the flight had left, an ICE official told him he would be separated from his son because he refused to be deported.

“I’m not giving my son away,” Mr. Snegir said, moving to shield Aleksandr.

The ICE official, Mr. Snegir recalled, told him that he would be taken to the ground, handcuffed and taken away if he did not relent.

“I did not move. I did not agree to do what she was asking, and everything she promised happened,” he said of the ICE official.

Aleksandr, who had witnessed his mother being arrested in Russia, appeared to be in shock, Mr. Snegir recalled: “He was asking why.”

After several weeks of separation, Mr. Snegir was visited by an ICE official who offered him another option: Go with your son, or we will deport you by yourself and you might not see him again.

This time, Mr. Snegir agreed to go back to Russia with his son.

But in a twist, the next day it emerged that Mr. Snegir had passed a protection screening for his claim of fearing torture in Russia. That means he can still be deported — just not to Russia.

For now, ICE is trying to deport him to a third country, but none have agreed to take him yet, according to internal agency documents. Until then, the two are being held separately, the father in ICE detention and the son in a shelter for unaccompanied children.

As it turns out, Evgeny and Evgeniia also passed their protection screening, which means the United States has determined that they, too, cannot be deported to Russia.

But as they wait for the next step, they remain in ICE detention. And Maksim is now in a foster home.

“It’s terrible, that’s what I can say,” Evgeniia said. “I wouldn’t wish it even to an enemy. It’s a constant grief and longing.”

She is allowed to speak on the telephone to her son, but she has no real answers to the first question he asks her: “Mama, when are you going to take me out of here?”

But for some parents, the danger is too great.

An Indian couple who were separated from their three children after they refused to board a commercial flight decided, in the end, to go back to India without the children, according to internal ICE records and their lawyer.

The couple asked not to be identified, but their case records showed that the first attempt to deport the family as a group had failed. The family unit, or FAMU, “refused to board the removal flight (commercial).”

The record went on to state that the family’s failure to comply with deportation orders was “a clear violation of law and hindrance to execute the removal order.”

“This is an interior enforcement separation,” it continued.

After several weeks, the couple were deported to India. In response to a request for comment, an ICE official said the agency was working to send the children back, too.

For the families who are still in the United States — like Evgeny, Evgeniia, Mr. Snegir and their children — the path ahead is uncertain.

But inside her ICE detention facility, Evgeniia tries to think of a hopeful future.

“I’m imagining how I will hug him when we meet again,” she said of Maksim. “I even saved a couple of candies, because that’s what I was planning to give to him when I see him again. That’s what I imagine.”

Luz Rivas took her oath of office in January, she didn’t anticipate that the most devastating fires in Los Angeles history would ignite that same week.

Luz Rivas took her oath of office in January, she didn’t anticipate that the most devastating fires in Los Angeles history would ignite that same week. She knew, however, that the move from the California State Legislature to Washington – with an unpredictable president and Republican congressional majority – would test her prowess as an elected official.

Just over six months into her first year as a congresswoman, Rivas has already faced a direct attack on her community, with the increase of federal immigration raids that began in June targeting her district and other Latino communities across the Southland.

“I feel like it’s been six years,” Rivas said.

“It is challenging to be a new member of Congress during this time,” she continued. “But that’s our job – to protect and defend our communities.”

Rivas said she is “all in” on defending the San Fernando Valley community and becomes more motivated every time she is back at home in her district.

On Monday, Rivas visited the City of San Fernando City Council to speak directly with councilmembers and constituents about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and what her office is doing to combat President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy.

“It’s important for elected officials on all levels of government to stand together against the threat that ICE poses to our communities,” Rivas told the San Fernando Valley Sun/el Sol in an exclusive interview.

She noted that her office is partnering with local organizations, distributing “Know Your Rights” information, connecting constituents to legal aid and can help locate missing loved ones by calling federal facilities on behalf of residents who reach out to them for help.

Although witnesses have documented masked federal agents indiscriminately kidnapping people off the street and disregarding the rule of law, Rivas believes it’s still important for our communities to be informed of the rights available to them.

“If you don’t know that your rights have been violated, how do you know whether you can complain or file a lawsuit?” Rivas pointed out. “Someone should know if their rights were not respected. Like me – I knew that [my rights were violated] when they didn’t let me into the detention center.”

The day after federal immigration officials’ first show of mass force in LA, conducting multiple raids across the county, Rivas joined three fellow members of Congress in downtown LA at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building to exercise their right as elected officials to conduct an oversight visit of the federal detention center. The congressmen were checking on the conditions of detainees after reports surfaced of immigrants being held with limited legal access and restricted access to food, water and medicine.

They were illegally denied entry for a tour and blocked by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE personnel.

“My colleagues and I have been trying to get information regarding their operations and decision-making process before, during or after ICE raids occur,” said Rivas. “We will continue asking these questions and demanding answers.”

Rivas has also visited the Adelanto Detention Facility and has since joined colleagues in writing letters to DHS and ICE to demand accountability.

Rivas Calls for an In-Person Meeting with Immigration Authorities

Most recently, Aug. 4, Rivas drafted a letter to Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, and Rodney S. Scott, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), requesting an in-person meeting to “conduct direct and constructive oversight to ensure accountability and transparency into the recent raids that have taken place in Los Angeles.”

“ICE has used intimidation tactics that have sown fear and chaos in communities,” wrote Rivas. “This sharp uptick in arrests and detainments by agents who are masked and in unmarked vehicles has not only instilled fear in communities, it has also not met the stated goal of this administration to target the ‘worst of the worst.’”

According to ICE detention data as of July 27, approximately 71% of those detained have no criminal conviction, and many of those convicted have committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

In the letter, Rivas questions how and who is conducting the often violent operations, since agents refuse to identify themselves with visible labels or identification.

“Without the ability to properly identify agents involved, there is no way to adequately file detailed complaints or requests for investigation. In addition, the lack of transparency is leading to confusion and misinformation about the use of ‘bounty hunters’ to conduct these raids,” Rivas continued.

The congresswoman highlighted multiple incidents in the district, including inappropriate use of force by CBP agents during a raid in Pacoima, and individuals complying with government orders at the Van Nuys Courthouse having their cases dismissed and being turned over to ICE.

“As an elected official not just representing the hard-working immigrant communities of the San Fernando Valley, but as someone who grew up here, I seek transparency and accountability from all federal agencies,” she concluded.

The Push for Legislation

Lawsuits against the Trump administration have made some progress in protecting immigrants and citizens alike from being targeted and racially profiled by federal agents. Last Friday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the federal government’s appeal, upholding an LA district judge’s ruling granting temporary restraining orders (TRO) that prevent the government from stopping individuals in violation of the Fourth Amendment and require the government to provide detained individuals with access to counsel.

“It’s a good step forward. I think it gave constituents or residents of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County hope that this could end,” said Rivas about the ruling. “But we need to keep our foot on the gas pedal.”

The Trump administration is expected to eventually appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the majority of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents. If the case is overruled, the onus would once again fall on Congress to create protective legislation.

Rivas noted that she has signed off on seven bills aimed at curbing ICE’s power and holding the administration accountable. These include the No Secret Police Act, which would require ICE, DHS and CBP agents to display proper identification and would ban the use of face coverings; the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which would prevent federal agents from showing up at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals and churches; and the Born in the USA Act, which would prohibit any funds from being used to implement Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship.

The congresswoman has also cosponsored a bill, the American Dream and Promise Act, that aims to build pathways to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients.

It’s been almost 40 years – with both Democrat and Republican led legislatures – since the last comprehensive piece of legislation for immigration reform was passed.

Being the minority party in Congress, Rivas acknowledged that passing these laws can be more difficult than when she was a State Assemblywoman working with a supermajority in the state legislature.

“The mission stays the same. The issues and priorities I have are the same as I had as a state legislator,” she reassured. “It’s just going to take longer to achieve them and work towards them in Congress.”

Rivas said she is learning from and collaborating with her colleagues, and is determined to keep fighting for the Latino communities in the San Fernando Valley.

“It’s obvious that these agents are our racial profiling in our communities, and that’s one of the biggest reasons that I’m involved – because it’s directly affecting the 29th district,” said Rivas.

Constituents who are legal permanent residents and even U.S. citizens born in this country have expressed concern to the congresswoman – afraid that if they are not carrying proof of their legal status or a birth certificate, they too will be unjustly detained simply because of the color of their skin or the language they speak.

“We can’t let Trump define who an American is,” Rivas said.",https://i0.wp.com/sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_04567_Page_2-e1754535598593.jpg?fit=1613%2C1095&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-07 02:56:47.176926

The Justice Department has been suing states to end tuition breaks for students without legal residency, starting with Texas in June. It has also filed lawsuits in Kentucky, Minnesota and, most recently, Oklahoma. Last year, Florida ended its tuition break for students living there illegally,

“Federal law prohibits aliens not lawfully present in the United States from getting in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens,” the Justice Department argued in a lawsuit this month in Oklahoma. “There are no exceptions.”

The tuition breaks once enjoyed wide bipartisan support but have increasingly come under criticism from Republicans in recent years.

Here's what to know about the tuition breaks:

Texas' tuition policy was initially passed with sweeping bipartisan majorities in the Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, as a way to open access to higher education for students without legal residency already living in the state. Supporters then and now say it boosted the state’s economy by creating a better-educated and better-prepared workforce.

The law allowed students without legal resident status to qualify for in-state tuition if they had lived in Texas for three years before graduating from high school and for a year before enrolling in college. They also had to sign an affidavit promising to apply for legal resident status as soon as possible.

Texas now has about 57,000 qualifying students enrolled in its public universities and colleges, according to the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a nonpartisan nonprofit group of university leaders focused on immigration policy. The state has about 690,000 students overall at its public universities.

The difference in tuition rates is substantial.

For example, at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a 34,000-student campus along the border with Mexico, a state resident will pay about $10,000 in basic tuition for a minimum full-time class schedule in the upcoming school year. A nonresident student will pay $19,000.

Texas' law stood mostly unchallenged for years, but it came under fire as debates over illegal immigration intensified. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, Perry apologized after saying critics of the law “did not have a heart.”

The law withstood several repeal efforts in the Republican-dominated Legislature. During the legislative session that ended June 2, a repeal bill did not even get a vote.

But the ax fell quickly. After the Trump administration filed a lawsuit calling the law unconstitutional, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a key Trump ally, chose not to defend the law in court and instead filed a motion agreeing that it should not be enforced.

In Oklahoma, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, also a Republican, filed a similar motion.

“Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful,"" Drummond said in a statement.

At least 21 states and the University of Michigan system have laws or policies allowing tuition breaks for the immigrant students, according to the National Immigration Law Center, which favors them. Those states include Democratic-leaning ones such as California and New York, but also GOP-leaning ones such as Kansas and Nebraska.

Obama calls GOP redistricting plans in Texas a 'power grab'

Former President Barack Obama criticized the GOP's congressional redistricting plans in Texas on social media this evening, saying the proposed revisions would undercut democracy.

""We can’t lose focus on what matters — right now, Republicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year’s midterm elections."" Obama wrote on X. ""This is a power grab that undermines our democracy.""

Texas Democrats left the state to delay votes on the plans, which would almost certainly give the GOP five more House seats in Congress. Their departure has outraged Republicans, with Gov. Greg Abbott suing to remove Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office.

Rhode Island lawmakers grilled about Gaza during town hall

and

Rep. Seth Magaziner and Sen. Jack Reed — two Democratic lawmakers from Rhode Island — have been interrupted numerous times at a joint town hall in Johnston by people asking about Israel's war in Gaza.

Several people have asked them to take tougher stances against Israel and to call the loss of life in Gaza a “genocide” and for them to stop taking money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

Reed called the conflict “complicated,” which elicited an audible laugh from an audience member who yelled in response that it wasn’t.

Magaziner called the scenes in Gaza “horrific,” adding later that neither he nor Reed had “anything kind to say about” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Sen. Michael Bennet tells town hall he’s 'incredibly angry' at Democratic Party for losing 2024 election to Trump

and

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a supportive crowd at a town hall today that he is “incredibly angry” at his party for losing last year's presidential election to Trump.

“We should never have lost this election,"" Bennet said at the event in Durango, part of the congressional district represented by GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd.

Bennet, who is running for governor, said that the election loss has been ""catastrophic"" and that the party was unprepared last year when it came to its policy platform.

""You tell me what the Democrats’ education policy was in the last election. You tell me what the Democrats’ health care policy was. You tell me if Democrats had an immigration policy that made any sense,"" Bennet said.

Bennet added that he is ""not here to blame them for that, but that’s part of what we have to figure out, as well.""

Responding to a question about Medicaid cuts by the Trump administration, Bennet said he would fight “to the death” for protections, adding that Democrats should message on the consequences of cuts to health care programs.

“People need to know what these Medicaid cuts are doing to our community. They have to know the unfairness of the tax bill that Donald Trump just pushed through, the cult of personality that he has in the U.S. Senate and other places. And we have to carry that message forward,” he said.

An attendee said Colorado “needs” Bennet in the Senate and shared her concerns about finding “someone equally competent” to replace him should he become governor.

“This decision was, for me, a matter of conscience. This was a moral decision,” Bennet said.

“This is not about quitting. It’s not about being worn out. It’s not about giving up. It’s not about even not wanting to spend one more day in the Senate with Ted Cruz, even though I don’t honestly want to do that,” he continued as the audience laughed. “It’s about being in the fight that you want to be in and making sure we can win that together.”

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has reached out to Trump about pardon, source says

Sean “Diddy” Combs’ defense team has reached out to Trump seeking a pardon after his conviction on prostitution-related offenses, a source close to the legal team told NBC News today.

In an interview with Newsmax on Friday, Trump said “they have talked to me about Sean” when he was asked about pardons, but Trump did not announce any decision.

The source close to Combs’ legal team confirmed that it has been in contact with Trump.

Combs, a musician and hip-hop mogul, was convicted in July of two counts of interstate prostitution and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced in October.

Texas governor sues to remove Texas House Democratic Caucus chair

Gov. Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition today with the Texas Supreme Court to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office after Wu and other Democrats left the state to delay efforts by Republicans to redraw congressional district lines.

The lawsuit argues that Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus chair, violated the state Constitution and that his absence amounted to his abandonment of office.

Wu did not immediately respond to a request for comment this evening.

Abbott said in a statement that Wu and more than 50 other Democrats who left the state had failed to meet quorum requirements in refusing to return.

""Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,” Abbott said. “Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.”

Abbott had warned in a statement Sunday that he would seek Democrats' removal if they weren't present when the House convened the next day.

Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin urges fellow Democrats to ‘go nuclear’ in redistricting fight

and

Reporting from Benton Harbor, Mich.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a rising Democratic star from Michigan, told NBC News that Democrats should “go nuclear” to counter Republicans’ push in Texas and other red states to redraw congressional maps in their favor.

Slotkin, a first-term senator who was chosen to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s joint address to Congress this year, said Democrats have to fight fire with fire.

“I’m going to urge and encourage blue states like a California or Chicago or Illinois to do the same thing. I don’t want to do that. I want the country to have a completely nonpartisan drawing of the lines based on the census. But if they’re going to do that and go nuclear, so am I,” she said in an interview after her first and only town hall of the August congressional recess last night.

A Republican got jeered at a town hall. He plans to hold more.

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., faced off with a raucous crowd that hurled boos, jeers and middle fingers at him at a town hall in Lincoln yesterday.

He said he has no regrets and would do it all over again.

“I don’t regret it at all,” Flood said in a phone interview today. “Every member of Congress has to do it the way they see fit. But for me, this comes with the territory. And I feel like you got to put yourself in the town square if you want to be a member of Congress for your district.”

“And if you feel strongly about how you’re voting and the choices you’re making,” he added, “you should be able to stand on the town square and be accountable for those votes and tell people why you did it and take their input.”

Trump says FBI 'may have to' get involved in locating and arresting Texas Democrats who left state

Trump said federal authorities ""may have to"" get involved in locating and arresting Texas Democrats who absconded from the state to block Republicans from moving forward with mid-decade redistricting plans.

Asked by a reporter today whether the federal government and the FBI should get involved in locating and arresting the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, Trump said, ""Well, they may have to, they may have to.""

“A lot of people have demanded they come back. You can’t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That’s what elections are all about,"" he added.

Yesterday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state’s Department of Public Safety to arrest Texas Democrats who left the state after the Texas House voted to compel the sergeant-at-arms to “send for” the return of the lawmakers “under warrant of arrest, if necessary.”

Government agencies get access to AI from Anthropic, Google and OpenAI

The General Services Administration announced a partnership today with three artificial intelligence companies — Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT — that will allow federal agencies to use AI tools across the federal government.

“Thanks to the amazing work of the Federal Acquisition Services team, these transformative AI projects are available for agencies to procure immediately,” Federal Acquisition Services Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said.

The uses of AI technology will vary. The AI tools can support a wide variety of applications, from back-office automation to critical mission functions, such as real-time translation, cybersecurity support and large-scale data analysis, a GSA spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said GSA adopted the technology first, claiming that the use of AI has saved more than 365,000 staff hours this year. The hope is that when it spread among the federal government — and when the workforce becomes more proficient and the AI technology improves — the time savings will allow more efficiency and innovation across the government.

On concerns about Americans’ data, the GSA spokesperson insisted the government is taking a cautious, security-first approach to AI that will ensure sensitive information remains protected but did not provide specifics.

GSA’s hope, according to the spokesperson, is that it will immediately translate to agencies, giving them access to tools that can improve workflow and citizen services — and for the AI companies, going through GSA gives them an entry point for offering services and products to the federal government.

Massachusetts governor hosts fleeing Texas Democrats but rules out mid-decade redistricting in her state

Reporting from Boston

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey this afternoon hosted nine Texas Democratic legislators who’d come to Bostonafter they left theirhome state amid Republican redistricting efforts.

Healey, a Democrat, offered her support to the Texas lawmakers but also ruled out pushing for redistricting in Massachusetts.

At a news conference in the Massachusetts state House, Healey, flanked by two Texas representatives and eight senators, called Texas Republicans’ efforts to push ahead with mid-decade redistricting a “partisan, craven, political power-grab attempt” by Trump, Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton. She added that the GOP move was meant to “further an agenda that’s about protecting them and their power.”

Healey offered her “support” to the lawmakers who left Texas, though she ruled out helping fund the fines they’ll incur as a result of abandoning the in-session Legislature.

And unlike her Democratic counterparts in New York and California — Govs. Kathy Hochul and Gavin Newsom, respectively, who've said they’d move forward with efforts that would allow their blue states to possibly also conduct mid-decade redistricting — Healey said she’d let Massachusetts’ existing congressional maps stand.

“We’re going to follow the rules. We just went through a customary and orderly process just a few years age,” she said.

Massachusetts, following the process that is typical in most states, redrew its congressional maps in 2021, after the 2020 census. The redistricting process in most states occurs at the start of each new decade, when new census data is available.

“We just did that,” Healey said. “The Massachusetts maps, in my view, are fair. They were drawn after a robust process and signed into law by a Republican — Gov. Charlie Baker.”

Meanwhile, Texas state Rep. Ana Hernandez, who, like her House colleagues, has been threatened by Texas Republicans with arrest and expulsion, told reporters that when it came to those threats, “that is not what we’re concerned about.”

“When we left, it was to make sure that our constituents have a voice, because that’s what this process is doing, it’s silencing our constituents,” she said.

Trump says for now JD Vance is 'most likely' successor of MAGA movement

Trump said this afternoon that Vice President JD Vance would ""probably be favored at this point"" to take up the helm of the MAGA movement when he concludes his second term in office.

The comment came in response to a reporter's question to Trump about whether he views Vance as the ""heir apparent.""

""Well, I think most likely, in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,"" Trump said, referring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

""It's too early, obviously to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point,"" Trump added.

The president's remarks came after he signed an Olympics-related executive order at the White House.

State Department announces program requiring some foreign visitors to pay bonds of up to $15,000

Reporting from Washington

The State Department is set to launch a new pilot program later this month that will require foreign visitors planning travel to the U.S. from certain countries to post bonds of up to $15,000, according to a temporary final rule published in the Federal Register today.

The program, scheduled to begin Aug. 20 and last until Aug. 5, 2026, will specifically apply to people in certain foreign countries applying for B-1 or B-2 visas for business or tourist travel to the United States. Each of those visas allows for a maximum stay of six months, though extensions are permitted in some cases.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has another White House meeting with Trump

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she met with Trump today at the White House.

It was the Democratic governor's third meeting with the president there this year — and fourth overall when counting their appearance at an April event to announce a new mission for a Michigan air base.

In a statement provided to NBC News, Whitmer said she told Trump “and his team about the impact tariffs are having on Michigan’s economy, especially our auto industry, the harm Michigan will face due to changes in the Medicaid program, and ongoing recovery efforts following the ice storm in Northern Michigan this year.”

Whitmer, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, has faced criticism from other Democrats for cultivating a closer working relationship with Trump. And she caught grief after a New York Times photographer captured an image of her shielding her face with folders while visiting the Oval Office in April.

Whitmer and her allies have pointed to what they see as tangible wins from her visits, including the new mission for the Selfridge Air National Guard Base and a commitment to combating invasive carp in the Great Lakes.

“I’ve always said that I’ll work with anyone to get things done for Michigan,” Whitmer said in today’s statement. “That’s why I’ve continued to go to Washington, D.C. to make sure that Michiganders are front and center when critical decisions are being made.”

She added: “I will always do whatever I can to make life a little easier for Michiganders and strengthen our economy. We should do everything in our power to lower costs and grow more good-paying jobs in Michigan. I appreciate the president’s time and attention to the matters we discussed.”

Ghislaine Maxwell’s transfer to cushy prison camp is a ‘travesty of justice,’ ex-BOP official says

Not long after it was first reported that Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to one of the cushiest federal detention facilities in the country, a private Facebook group dedicated to current and former federal prison staffers erupted in shock and outrage.

The federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, is one of seven minimum security, dormitory-style federal security facilities that do not typically hold inmates like Maxwell, 63, who are convicted of sex crimes and serving lengthy sentences.

“As a retired BOP employee, this makes me sick,” wrote one person on the “Bureau of Prisons staff and retirees” Facebook page.

“Since when are sex offenders allowed at the camp?” another wrote. “I don’t care who she snitched on, she’s a damn human trafficker.”

Trump admin ends '5 things' email requirement for federal workers

The Trump administration is officially ending the Elon Musk-led “5 Things” program, which required federal employees to send five bullet points of their work accomplishments to HR each week.

“We communicated with agency HR leads that OPM was no longer going to manage the five things process nor utilize it internally,"" U.S. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said in a statement to NBC News. ""At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so.”

Since its inception in February, agencies have exercised discretion as to whether and how their employees should comply with the requirement, with many phasing it out entirely.

Texas state House still lacks quorum amid redistricting clash

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows quickly gaveled the state House in and out of session today, lacking the minimum number of state lawmakers to move on to regular business after dozens of Democrats fled the state in protest of a GOP-led bill that would redraw congressional boundaries to benefit Republicans.

Addressing the 94 members who attended today's session, shy of the 100 needed for a quorum, Burrows criticized Democrats and accused them of shirking their responsibilities in the wake of terrible floods that killed more than 100 people outside of San Antonio earlier this summer.

""Today, the disaster preparedness committee is meeting to consider five priority pieces of legislation. Each will address the catastrophic flooding that has devastated homes and entire communities,"" he said. ""That's the kind of important work that's being done in the House and all elected members should be here representing their districts in those conversations.”

Democrats have argued that the GOP's focus on redistricting over flood response in the early days of the special session undercuts Burrows' argument.

Democratic legislators in 3 states unveil bills banning use of face masks by ICE agents

Reporting from Boston, Mass.

A group of Democratic state legislators across three states unveiled a series of bills today that would ban the use of face coverings by law enforcement officers — an attempt to curtail the much-criticized use of such items by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As part of Trump’s promises to deport undocumented immigrants, ICE officers have ramped up their presence in cities and towns across the U.S., conducting an expanded number of raids and enforcement actions — and increasingly doing so while wearing face masks that shield their identities.

The bills from Democratic state lawmakers in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania would ban the use of such coverings. Enforcement of the laws, if enacted, would be overseen by the attorneys general in those states.

“The biggest problem is with ICE federal agents who are appearing as if they are masked militia,” New York Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy, who’s sponsored the bill in her state, said at a news conference on the sidelines of the National Conference of State Legislatures’ annual summit in Boston. “We think a dangerous line is being crossed here, and that immigration enforcement is really turning into more of a paramilitary type secret police,” she added.

Massachusetts state Rep. Jim Hawkins, who sponsored the bill in his state, said his proposal “is a step towards mending the divide and fostering trust between law enforcement and the public with transparency identification and reason.”

“There should be no need for disguises while performing their duties to the communities they serve,” he added.

“You don’t see our local police running around masked up,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Paul Friel, who sponsored the bill in his state, said. “You don’t see judges making decisions behind shields, behind the curtain. You don’t see lawmakers making bills anonymously.”

All three lawmakers acknowledged that their proposals have no support from Republicans in their legislatures. That might not be a problem in New York and Massachusetts, where Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governorship. But Pennsylvania’s split state government — the state has a Democratic governor and a GOP-controlled state Senate, while Democrats hold only a one-seat majority in the state House — effectively ensures no movement on the bill.

GAO says that the NIH violated law by withholding funds

The Government Accountability Office said in a report today that the National Institutes of Health ""violated"" the Impoundment Control Act by withholding funds that had been appropriated by Congress.

NBC News reported in May that an analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicated the Trump administration had cut more than $1.8 billion in NIH grants. The legality of the funding cuts is playing out in court.

The GAO, which is the watchdog arm of Congress, emphasized in its 21-page report that the president does not have ""unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.""

The report said that HHS' resumption of meetings to review grants ""alone does not ensure"" that funds were not being improperly withheld.

""If the executive branch wishes to make changes to the appropriation provided to NIH, it must propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the law for consideration by Congress,"" the report concluded.

Reached for comment, an HHS spokesperson relayed the department’s submitted response to GAO, indicating that the NIH has ""moved rapidly to reschedule and hold meetings impacted by the short pause, and to process grant applications."" The response also pointed to thousands of new grants issued by the NIH, which is housed within HHS.

Greg Abbott threatens to arrest Democrats who left Texas over redistricting

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to stall a controversial redistricting plan with national implications.

NBC’s Ryan Chandler reports for ""TODAY.""

Pritzker says he would consider a redistricting special session

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said today he would consider calling a special session to reopen his state’s congressional maps.

The state is already one of the most gerrymandered in the country, with Democrats holding 14 of the state’s 17 seats.

When asked if he would consider calling a special session to redraw the state’s map, Pritzker said, “Donald Trump is a cheater, so is Gov. Greg Abbott, and Texas Republicans are carrying out their will.”

“If they’re going to cheat, then all of us have to take a hard look at what the effect of that cheating is on our democracy, and that means we’ve all got to stand up,” he said, adding that “everything’s on the table.”

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who attended the same news conference, told NBC News that his party should use “all tools at their disposal,” noting the possibility that other GOP-controlled states like Ohio and Missouri could try to change their maps, too.

Rwanda says it reaches a deal with U.S. to take in up to 250 migrants

The United States and Rwanda have agreed for the African country to potentially accept hundreds of migrants deported from the U.S., the spokesperson for the Rwandan government and an official told Reuters, as the Trump administration takes a hardline approach toward immigration.

“Rwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants, in part because nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement, and our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation,” said the spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo.

GOP lawmaker says Speaker Johnson needs to 'show some leadership' and end redistricting 'chaos'

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., is calling on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to ""show some leadership"" and end the redistricting ""chaos"" that is unfolding in several states across the nation.

""The old saying is that voters should choose their representatives; representatives shouldn’t choose their voters,"" Kiley said in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. ""And I think that what’s happening right now across the country, and especially in California, is a very unhealthy thing for democracy.""

Kiley has introduced legislation in the House to nullify any new redistricting maps adopted by states before the 2030 census.

He argued the latest redistricting efforts in Texas and his home state of California are ""not a good thing for the current members of Congress, it’s not a good thing for voters, it’s not a good thing for either Democrats or Republicans, it’s certainly not a good thing for the country.""

""I think that the speaker and Leader Jeffries need to show some leadership here to bring this chaos to an end,"" he said, referring also to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

The speaker's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

GOP Sen. John Cornyn urges FBI to locate or arrest Democratic legislators who fled Texas

and

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is urging the FBI to assist Texas law enforcement agencies in findingor arresting Democratic legislators who fled the state over the weekend to block a Republican redistricting plan from proceeding.

In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel today, Cornyn said he wants the FBI to aid in the efforts ""to locate or arrest potential lawbreakers who have fled the state.""

""I request the FBI’s assistance, as federal resources are necessary to locate the out-of-state Texas legislators who are potentially acting in violation of the law,"" Cornyn wrote. ""The FBI has tools to aid state law enforcement when parties cross state lines, including to avoid testifying or fleeing a scene of a crime. Specifically, I am concerned that legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.""

Cornyn is running for re-election next year and is facing a GOP primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who called for the arrest of the lawmakers yesterday.

There are no plans to use federal agents to arrest the Democratic lawmakers, a Trump administration official said yesterday. “Gov. Greg Abbott can handle his own state,” the official said.

House committee subpoenas the Clintons and several top former DOJ officials for testimony on Jeffrey Epstein

and

The House committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case announced it issued subpoenas today to former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several top former Justice Department officials for their testimony.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said it had sent out the deposition subpoenas to the Clintons; former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Bill Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales; and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller “for testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein.”

DNC Chair Ken Martin says his party is bringing a 'knife to knife fight'

Reporting from Chicago area

AURORA, Ill. — Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said today that his party is “not rolling over” to Trump as he warned that Texas Republican attempts to go through with emergency redistricting would only spur other states to do the same.

Martin joined Gov. JB Pritzker and a throng of Texas House Democrats who have been taking refuge in the blue Midwestern state since Sunday to break a legislative quorum back home.

He pledged to help Democrats fight attempts by Texas Republicans to redraw the state political map to yield its party potentially up to five more congressional seats, a request that publicly came from the president.

“This is not the Democratic Party of your grandparents, who would bring a pencil to a knife fight,” Martin said. “This is the new Democratic Party that will bring in a knife to a knife fight.”

Democrats have said that if Texas goes through with its plan, they would attempt to take similar steps in California and potentially other states.

Trump says JPMorgan, Bank of America didn't want him as a customer

Trump told CNBC this morning that two of the nation's largest banks closed his bank accounts or rejected him as a customer.

Speaking in a wide-ranging interview, Trump said JPMorgan Chase told him he had to take ""hundreds of millions of dollars in cash"" out within 20 days. Trump then said Bank of America's CEO told him he could not open an account there despite what he characterized as its CEO's kowtowing to him ""when I was president.""

""So I went to another one, another one, another one,"" Trump said.

""The banks discriminated against me very badly, and I was very good to the banks,"" he said.

Bank of America declined to comment on the president's comments, but JPMorgan Chase said in a statement: “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed. We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.”

Ex-Russian president warns enemies of ‘new reality’ as Kremlin ditches nuclear treaty

Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev has warned that the country’s rivals now faced a “new reality” as the Kremlin formally announced it was no longer bound by a treaty limiting the use of short- and medium-range nuclear missiles.

Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council and is known for issuing frequent apocalyptic threats on social media, was continuing a war of words that prompted Trump to redeploy two nuclear submarines last week.

Modi was ready to ‘make India great again,’ then Trump put America first

The U.S. and India’s blossoming friendship is at risk of fracturing, observers have warned, as Trump threatens to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods over its purchases of Russian oil.

At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump’s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump’s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India, moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan, and mocked India’s “dead” economy.

State Department unveils plan for travelers from certain countries to pay thousands before entering the U.S.

The State Department unveiled plans that will make travelers from certain countries to pay a $5,000 to $15,000 bond in order to visit the U.S.

The one-year program, which targets people from countries with “high visa overstay rates” and other factors, aims to prevent people from overstaying visas, according to the documented published today in the Federal Register.

Travelers would have the funds returned if they leave the U.S. on time and comply with travel permission rules.

Most affected people will be expected to pay a $10,000 bond, although the amount can be set at $5,000 or $15,000 depending on travelers’ circumstances. The program is set to go into effect Aug. 20, and the State Department will announce affected countries on its website.

The program is “intended to encourage foreign governments to take immediate action to reduce the overstay rates of their nationals when traveling to the United States for temporary visits, and to encourage countries to improve screening and vetting and the security of travel and civil documents, including in the granting of citizenship,” the document said.

The first Trump administration also initiated a temporary bond program, but the plan was not fully implemented because of the impact of the Covid pandemic on travel.

Trump said on CNBC that Republicans were ""entitled"" to more congressional seats in Texas, where the state GOP is pushing to redistrict the state in a way that would give an advantage to the party in next year's election.

""We are entitled to five more seats,"" Trump said.

The president pointed to gerrymandering in blue states as well, claiming that Republicans should have more seats in Congress.

Trump says E.U. imports to face 35% tariff if the bloc does not invest $600 billion in U.S.

Trump said that if the European Union did not invest $600 billion in the U.S. as he previously announced, imports from the bloc would face 35% tariffs.

The tariff rate will be set at 15% for imports from the E.U. after Trump announced a trade agreement last month.

Trump takes Scott Bessent off the shortlist for Federal Reserve

Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he's taking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent off the shortlist for Federal Reserve chair.

Trump said Bessent wants to remain at the Treasury Department.

""I asked him just last night, is this something you want? 'Nope. I want to stay where I am,'"" Trump said Bessent told him.

For Fed chair, Trump said he was considering current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and at least two other unnamed people.

Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term will end in May. Powell has come under continual criticism from Trump for not moving quicker to lower interest rates.

U.S. bans travelers from Burundi, citing 'repeated' visa violations

U.S. visas for travelers from Burundi are temporarily banned, the U.S. embassy in the East African country said, citing “repeated violations” of visa rules.

“Every Burundian who travels carries the hopes of their family and community. Respecting visa rules isn’t just personal, it is national,” the embassy said yesterday in a post on X. “Sadly, due to repeated violations, U.S. visas for Burundians are temporarily banned.”

Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world, was among seven countries whose citizens were partially blocked from entering the U.S. in a June proclamation by Trump. The proclamation cited a U.S. government report saying Burundi had an overstay rate of more than 15% for business and tourism visas.

Nebraska Republican faces rowdy town hall with questions about Epstein files and fired BLS chief

and

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., held a town hall last night that started with boos shortly after he took the stage and ended with chants of “vote him out” when it ended.

In between, Flood was consistently heckled as he responded to questions about the release of more information on Jeffrey Epstein, Trump’s firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner and cuts to Medicaid in the GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Rep. Adam Smith says an aide was ‘physically assaulted’ at his town hall

and

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a post on X last night that one of his staff members was “physically assaulted” during his town hall at Renton Technical College in Washington, calling it “an act that crosses every line of civil discourse.”

“Today’s town hall was intentionally disrupted to attempt to silence a democratic conversation between a Representative and his constituents,” Smith said in the post. He emphasized that while peaceful protest is protected, “violence and coordinated efforts to shut down public dialogue are not.”

Kshama Sawant, a socialist running for Smith’s seat, posted a video on X of what appeared to be individuals being handcuffed. Sawant called them “3 peaceful anti-genocide activists” who she said were merely chanting at Smith's event.

In a statement, Sawant criticized Smith's voting record on Israel: ""Adam Smith has blood on his hands. He needs to be thrown out of office and put on trial for war crimes.""

Smith's office declined further comment.

Workers Strike Back, which Sawant co-founded, shared her post, saying the activists were from their group.

A spokesperson for the Renton, Washington, police department confirmed that three people were arrested on trespassing charges. They were booked into jail, spokesperson Meeghan Black said.

Nine protesters ""took over the stage at the town hall, shouting and disrupting the meeting,"" which was then canceled by Smith, Black said. Three of the protesters refused to leave, she said, adding, ""They were warned they’d be arrested if they didn’t leave.""

""They didn’t go and were arrested,"" she said.

Two officers were at the event when it began, and other officers began to arrive an hour later, she said.

Switzerland says it will make U.S. a ‘more attractive’ trade offer

Switzerland, which was surprised to find itself facing one of the highest U.S. tariff rates in the world, says it is determined to continue talks and that it is ready to make a “more attractive” trade offer to the Trump administration.

“Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking U.S. concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation,” its government said in a statement yesterday.

Trump said last week that he would impose a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland, below only Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%) and Syria (41%). Swiss officials said the rate is far higher than those on comparable U.S. trading partners such as the E.U. (15%), Japan (15%) and Britain (10%).

Switzerland said over 99% of U.S. goods have entered the country tariff-free since the start of last year and that its trade surplus with the U.S. is not the result of any unfair trade practices. It said it was not considering any retaliatory measures.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250802-trump-ch-1628-cb3f01.jpg",N,,2025-08-07 02:56:56.505120

On June 4, 2025, the Trump administration announced a new travel ban targeting 19 countries. This marks a significant expansion of the travel bans President Trump issued during his first term, and reflects a more aggressive use of the president’s authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals who would otherwise qualify to come to the United States. Media reports have confirmed the administration is weighing imposing restrictions on 36 additional countries—primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.

Banning immigrants from these countries, many of whom come to the United States to reunite with family, will cause hardship and emotional stress for them and their relatives. Because many also come to study or work, it will also lead to major disruptions in higher education, labor markets in essential U.S. industries, and tax revenues and consumer spending.

The targeted immigrant groups hold significant economic clout, and the travel ban will have adverse impact on local businesses and communities across the United States. This report analyzes the scope, stated rationale, and consequences of the June 2025 travel ban, drawing on recent and historical data to assess its potential impact on the U.S. economy and on American communities and families.

Which Countries Did the June 2025 Travel Ban Target?

The June 2025 travel ban is concentrated on two regions of the world: the Middle East and North Africa; and sub-Saharan Africa. The five countries covered by the new bans (full or partial) in the Middle East and North Africa are home to 45 percent of the region’s population. The eight countries affected by full or partial bans in sub-Saharan Africa are home to 6.4 percent of that region’s population.

Additionally, the administration has signaled it may further target sub-Saharan Africa for future travel bans. Twenty-four of the 36 countries that have been identified as future ban candidates are in sub-Saharan Africa. If all 24 were to be hit with bans in the future, an additional 71 percent of the region’s population would be affected.

How Many Visas Were Issued to the Affected Countries Last Year?

In fiscal year (FY) 2024, the U.S. government issued 161,987 visas in categories that would be subject to the June 2025 travel ban. These included both immigrant and non-immigrant visa categories, such as tourist and temporary worker visas, and were led by visas issued to nationals of Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba.

Half of the immigrant visas issued in the categories affected by the June 2025 travel ban, 12,738, were for extended family members of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, including adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens and spouses or unmarried children of lawful permanent residents. The next largest numbers were for diversity visas and employment-based visas.

Of the non-immigrant visas in the affected categories, 86.5 percent were for tourists and business travelers, followed by students (7 percent) and commercial sea or international airline crewmembers (2.6 percent).

What Was the Impact of the Previous Travel Bans?

The number of immigrant visas issued to the six countries most affected by the Trump administration’s previous travel bans—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—dropped by 69.9 percent between FY 2016 and FY 2019, with Iran and Somalia seeing the biggest declines.

The number of non-immigrant visas issued for these six countries plunged even further, by 84.7 percent, between FY 2016 and FY 2019, led by Libya and Yemen.

What Could Be the Direct Economic Impact of the 2025 Travel Ban?

At least 298,600 nationals of the 19 countries named in the most recent travel ban arrived in the United States in 2022. These new arrivals made significant contributions to the U.S. economy. In 2023 alone, households led by these recent arrivals earned $3.2 billion in household income, paid $715.6 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.

These nationals made important contributions in U.S. industries that are facing labor shortages and rely on foreign-born workers. Those who worked were concentrated in hospitality (15.9 percent), construction (13.8 percent), retail trade (11.6 percent), manufacturing (11.4 percent), and professional services (11.2 percent). The manufacturing industry alone could face a shortage of 1.9 million workers by 2033.

An additional 88,900 nationals of the 36 countries that might be subjected to future travel bans also entered the United States in 2022. Households led by these immigrants collectively earned more than $1.4 billion in income, paid $359.9 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $1 billion in spending power the following year.

What Could Be the Indirect Impact on the Broader Immigrant Population?

Under the June 2025 travel ban, many foreign-born individuals already living in the United States will be unable or afraid to reunite with family members living overseas. Even those who need to travel abroad will face uncertainty about whether they’ll be allowed to return.

About 4.3 million immigrants from countries affected by the ban lived in the United States in 2023, making up 9 percent of the overall immigrant population. They included 2.4 million naturalized citizens. More than one-third (41.8 percent) lived in Florida, followed by California, Texas, and New York.

The expansion of the previous travel bans for 19 countries—and potentially 36 more—will have far-reaching consequences for the country, disrupting family reunification, discouraging international talent from coming to the country to study and work, and threatening key sectors of the U.S. economy that depend on immigrant labor. It also undermines the economic and social contributions that long-standing immigrant communities have made across the country.

As this administration weighs future actions on the June 2025 travel ban, it is critical that policymakers pay close attention to the humanitarian and socioeconomic costs of such sweeping restrictions and hold the administration accountable for the consequences of its actions.

Introduction

On June 4, 2025, the Trump administration announced a new travel ban to restrict or prohibit entry for individuals from 19 countries.

It follows a series of bans President Donald Trump enacted during his first term, beginning in 2017, when the federal government barred entry for nationals from several Muslim-majority countries. That first ban set off protests at airports, sparked a flurry of court challenges, and underwent multiple revisions before a final version was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. Two years later, the administration added six additional countries to the ban, citing purported national security and screening concerns. The Biden administration fully repealed the ban in January 2021.

The newly implemented travel ban targets a greater number of countries and has a broader geographic scope than the earlier bans. But it bears structural similarities to the previous iteration—specifically in exemptions like for legal permanent residents—that was upheld by the Supreme Court and has a slower roll-out period, a combination that could make it harder to successfully challenge in the courts.

Days after the new travel ban took effect on June 9, reporting revealed that the Trump administration had written an internal memo about the possibility of adding 36 more countries—primarily in Africa—to the travel ban list, if they are unable to meet the U.S. government’s requirements on vetting and screening within 60 days. The U.S. Department of State has reportedly indicated that a nation’s willingness to accept third-country nationals deported from the United States will play a factor in the decision.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce declined to discuss the specifics of the cable. However, she confirmed that the administration is urging countries to strengthen their passport vetting procedures, cooperate in accepting deported nationals from the United States, and take additional measures to ensure their citizens do not pose a threat to American security.

The June 2025 travel ban, and its potential expansion, have broad implications for immigrant communities. Reports have already emerged about children unable to reunite with their parents in the United States, foreign doctors kept away from patients awaiting them in U.S. hospitals, and immigrant entrepreneurs hesitating to take international trips needed for their businesses. This report examines how this ban will have consequences that ripple across American society.

Which Countries Did the June 2025 Travel Ban Target?

The June 2025 order imposes a full ban on twelve countries. Individuals from these countries cannot seek either an immigrant visa, which results in lawful permanent residency after entry to the United States, or any non-immigrant visas, which are temporary in nature and for specific purposes like tourism, work, or study.

It imposes a separate, partial ban on an additional seven countries. People from countries under the partial ban may be eligible for certain non-immigrant visas only. They will still be banned from all immigrant visas as well as some non-immigrant visas.

People with current visas are exempt from the new travel ban, along with other groups, including legal permanent residents; dual nationals; immediate relatives (spouses, minor children, or parents) of U.S. citizens; refugees; Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders; and members of athletic teams traveling for major sports events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The 19 countries included in the June 2025 travel ban were home to about 429.6 million people—roughly 5.3 percent of the world’s population—in 2023. Thirteen of these countries, or 68 percent, are in Africa and the Middle East. Combined, the populations of the affected countries made up 45 percent of the total population of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and 6.4 percent of the total population of sub-Saharan Africa.

Adding the 36 countries being considered for the travel ban would add 1 billion people to the affected population. These countries include a higher representation of sub-Saharan Africa, with 24 of the 36 making up 71 percent of the region’s population.

Furthermore, the administration will have the option to add or remove countries from the list of banned nations. Starting on September 2, 2025 (90 days after the announcement of the June 2025 ban), the secretary of state can forward recommendations to the president every 180 days with any suggested adjustments to the order. As a result, the number of people ultimately affected by the ban could fluctuate.

What Are the Stated Justifications for the Travel Ban?

In the text of the June 2025 order enacting the travel ban, the Trump administration gives three main reasons for targeting the 19 countries: inadequate vetting and information sharing; high rates of visa overstays; and recalcitrant countries refusing to accept their nationals who have been ordered deported from the United States. Specifically, the order claims that 10 of the 19 countries conducted inadequate vetting and information-sharing; 15 had high overstay rates; and eight were recalcitrant.

While the first justification, claiming inadequate vetting and information sharing, has legal precedent—affirmed by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii—the others are new and are arguably questionable. To start, existing immigration law already provides mechanisms to address recalcitrant countries, such as visa sanctions. This proclamation appears to bypass those statutory tools in favor of a more aggressive use of presidential authority.

Next, the connection between visa overstay rates and the imposed restrictions is often tenuous. For example, the administration bans the issuance of immigrant visas for several countries based solely on non-immigrant overstay rates, even though immigrant visas are intended for permanent immigrants and are therefore not subject to overstays.

Moreover, the administration’s claims rely on Department of Homeland Security estimates that have faced criticism for failing to accurately reflect unrecorded departures or instances where individuals legally extended or adjusted their immigration status. The government is limited in its ability to match immigration records across agencies, leading to some individuals falsely being deemed “suspected overstays.”

Finally, most of the countries cited for high overstay rates (all but Haiti and Venezuela) actually have a relatively small number of overstayers that is likely an overcount: In FY 2023, an average of 545 people per country reportedly overstayed their visas. As an example, Chad, with a population of over 19 million, had only 451 suspected visa overstays in FY 2023.

Exemptions in the current travel ban raise additional questions. While the ban exempts immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who can prove identity through DNA, it denies similar flexibility to individuals in other family-based categories, such as the children of green card holders or the siblings of U.S. citizens.

Taken together, these inconsistencies cast doubt on the ban’s stated purpose of improving vetting and reducing visa overstays. The policy’s overinclusive design sweeps in individuals whose entry poses no clear risk, while its exceptions allow many others to continue entering the country—undermining the administration’s own security rationale. Rather than a narrowly tailored national security measure, the ban appears to function primarily as a tool to restrict immigration from countries disfavored by the administration.

How Many Visas Were Issued to the Affected Countries?

In FY 2024, the U.S. government issued 161,987 immigrant and non-immigrant visas to nationals of the affected countries in the categories that would be subject to the new travel ban, excluding immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders, and visas covered by the exemptions. These visas included 68,557 visas issued to individuals from countries under the full travel ban and 93,430 visas issued to countries under the partial travel ban. The highest number of visas were issued to nationals of Venezuela (39.4 percent), followed by Iran (12.6 percent), and Cuba (10.7 percent).

The number of all visas issued included 25,086 immigrant visas: 14,263 to people from the 12 countries under the full travel ban; and 10,823 to people from the seven countries under the partial travel ban.

About 51 percent (12,738) of the immigrant visas were issued in the family-based categories, including adult children and siblings. The greatest number of these were to people from Cuba (5,540), Yemen (1,714), and Haiti (1,485).

More than one-third of the immigrant visas (42 percent) were diversity visas, granted through lottery to people from countries with low immigration rates. These primarily went to people from Sudan, Iran, and Cuba. Just 4.7 percent were employment-based immigrant visas, for individuals sponsored by a U.S. business, notably to nationals of Venezuela and Iran.

In the same fiscal year, the U.S. government issued 136,901 non-immigrant visas to people from these countries: 54,294 to individuals from countries subject to full visa restrictions; and 82,607 B-1, B-2, F, M, and J visas to individuals from countries under the partial travel ban.

About 86.5 percent of the non-immigrant visas were B-1 and B-2 visas, for visitors like tourists, business travelers, and those visiting family temporarily, with Venezuela and Iran receiving the largest number.

F visas, for international students, made up 7 percent of non-immigrant visas issued to affected countries; D visas, for crewmembers (workers on commercial sea vessels or international airlines), made up 2.6 percent; J visas, for exchange students and scholars, comprised 1.9 percent; and K visas, for the fiancés of U.S. citizens, comprised 1.3 percent. These are diverse groups of people who would not have been allowed into the country had they entered after June 9, 2025, constituting an abrupt shift that would disrupt international tourism and transportation, hurt educational and cultural exchanges, and separate families.

What Was the Impact of the Previous Travel Ban?

To fully understand the implications of the June 2025 travel ban, it’s essential to revisit the effects of the travel ban issued by the first Trump administration.

The executive order was signed on January 27, 2017, and went into effect mere hours after the text was published. Within 24 hours, around 375 travelers were affected, with 109 people detained while in transit and 173 people prevented from boarding flights to the United States before a court blocked the order. Within the first seven days, the State Department said, “roughly 60,000 individuals’ visas were provisionally revoked.” The ban was later revised, going through four iterations during the first Trump administration. The third version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, and in 2020 a fourth version added six more countries. Many of these countries saw their visa issuance drop significantly, even before the COVID-19 pandemic heavily restricted international travel.

The third version of the travel ban had targeted eight countries, although Venezuela was included only in a limited form, banning travel for government officials and their families; and Chad was removed in 2018 after the White House claimed that the country improved its information-sharing and identify-management practices.

The remaining six countries—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—were under a broad travel ban for at least 30 months, until the Biden administration repealed it in January 2021. These six countries bore the brunt of the ban and are the focus of the Council’s subsequent analysis.

Between FY 2016 and FY 2019, the total number of immigrant visas issued to nationals of these six countries dropped by 69.9 percent. Iran saw the biggest decline, of 79 percent, from 7,727 visas to 1,634 visas, while Yemen’s visa issuance dropped to one-third of its FY 2016 level, from 12,998 visas to 4,379 visas.

The issuance of non-immigrant visas to these countries plunged even further, by 84.7 percent between FY 2016 and FY 2019. Under a full travel ban, Iran saw the number of non-immigrant visas issued to its nationals fall from 29,404 in FY 2016 to 4,244 by FY 2019, a decline of approximately 85.6 percent. Meanwhile, Libya, under a partial travel ban, experienced a drop of business and tourism visas issued to its nationals from 1,445 to 96.

The relatively few visas that were issued in this time period were due to the limited exemptions and waivers set for the previous travel ban, such as the exemptions for dual citizens and representatives of international organizations.

Meanwhile, these sharp declines in visa issuance highlight the immediate and profound impact of the administration’s travel ban.

Because the first Trump administration’s travel ban primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries—and was sometimes known as the “Muslim Ban”—it may have affected travel decisions throughout the Middle East. For instance, research from 2017 revealed that after the first travel ban, tourism from the Middle East to the United States dropped by one-quarter.

If tourists were anxious about traveling to the United States, so, too, apparently were students. A study of two Texas universities found that the 2017 travel ban significantly reduced the number of applications from international graduate students, especially those from Muslim-majority nations. Most notably, the universities experienced more than a 50 percent drop in applications from nationals of the seven countries specifically named in the first version of the travel ban. Prior research also revealed that the previous travel ban alarmed international doctoral students, leading to stress, confusion, and worries about travel, visa stability, and future job prospects.

International students often fill critical gaps in the workforce—particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields—furthering the ability of American researchers and businesses to succeed. Policies that limit their ability to study and work in the United States not only hamper local economies but also hamstring the research and innovation pipelines in American universities and companies—ultimately undermining U.S. global competitiveness.

What Could Be the Direct Economic Impact of the June 2025 Travel Ban?

While government records provide the most up-to-date counts of visa issuance, their insights into the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of those new arrivals are limited. To fill in the gaps, we use the latest American Community Survey (ACS) microdata, from 2023, which provides detailed information about the non-citizens who entered the United States in 2022 and lived in the country in the following year. This approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the populations most directly comparable to those who will likely be affected by the new travel restrictions.

At least 298,600 nationals of the 19 countries targeted by the June 2025 travel ban arrived in the United States in 2022.i

About 69,700 nationals of countries named in the full travel ban arrived in the country in 2022, with the majority from Haiti (34.9 percent), Afghanistan (33 percent), and Iran (17.4 percent). About 228,900 people from countries named in the partial travel ban arrived in the country in 2022, with almost all from Cuba (65.2 percent) and Venezuela (33.8 percent).

At least 5 percent of these new arrivals, or 15,700 people, were enrolled in colleges and universities in 2023. This population represents a significant pipeline of international talent tapped by American businesses and organizations.

About 34 percent of the new arrivals had already received at least a bachelor’s degree, and 10 percent held an advanced degree.

Banning people like this from coming to America to study, work, and reunite with family will not only cause hardship; it will also lead to a loss in tax revenues and consumer spending that could support local American businesses and communities.

In 2023 alone, households led by recently arrived nationals of the affected countries earned $3.2 billion in income, paid $715.6 million in combined federal, state, and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.

These new arrivals were also more likely to be of working age than U.S.-born residents, and, as such, were key contributors to the U.S. labor force. About 77 percent were between the ages of 16 and 64, compared with 60.9 percent of the U.S.-born population, and most worked.

These new arrivals had an employment rate of 82.8 percent, helping to ease critical labor shortages in America’s vital industries.

These workers were mostly concentrated in hospitality (15.9 percent), construction (13.8 percent), retail trade (11.6 percent), manufacturing (11.4 percent), and professional services (11.2 percent). The June 2025 travel ban threatens to exacerbate labor shortages in these industries, many of which have trouble recruiting enough U.S.-born workers and rely on foreign-born employees.

The most common occupations for these new arrivals included construction laborers (6.1 percent), cooks (4.3 percent), truck drivers (3.7 percent), maids and housekeeping cleaners (3.7 percent), and janitors and building cleaners (3.3 percent)—jobs vital to the construction, transportation, and hospitality industries.

The manufacturing industry alone is projected to experience a shortage of 1.9 million workers by 2033. Meanwhile, construction laborers, janitors and building cleaners, and cooks are among the top occupations with the most potential for job growth between 2023 and 2033; they are projected to add 115,400, 75,800, and 244,500 jobs, respectively.

In 2023, there were already 1.7 job openings for every available worker nationwide, with an aging population expected to exacerbate the labor crisis. A drop in the number of new arrivals due to the June 2025 travel ban could further strain the workforce, hindering business growth, destabilizing wages, and intensifying inflation—raising prices for goods and services for American consumers.

Furthermore, 88,900 people from the 36 countries that may soon be added to the travel ban entered the United States in 2022; 24.1 percent were from Nigeria, 18.6 percent were from Ghana, and 9.2 percent were from Ethiopia.

Collectively, households led by nationals of these 36 countries who arrived in 2022 earned $1.4 billion in income, paid $359.9 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $1.0 billion in spending power in the year after their arrival. Placing more countries on the new travel ban would significantly amplify the economic consequences.

What Could Be the Indirect Impact on the Broader Immigrant Population and the U.S. Economy?

In 2023, about 4.3 million immigrants from the 19 countries named in the June 2025 travel ban lived in the United States, making up 9 percent of the overall immigrant population. They included 2.4 million naturalized citizens and 1.9 million non-citizens.

Under the June 2025 travel ban, many of these people will not be able to see family members living abroad. Even those who need to travel internationally will have to worry about whether they can return.

Under the June order, existing visas cannot be revoked, but those who need to leave the United States and renew their visas after they expire could be subjected to the ban instead of being allowed to return.

Foreign-born residents from Cuba make up the largest share of those affected by the June 2025 travel ban, with over 1.4 million individuals: 832,600 naturalized citizens and 598,900 non-citizens. Haiti follows with 775,000 foreign-born residents, 58.8 percent of whom are naturalized citizens. Venezuela ranks third, with 766,400 individuals, while Iran and Afghanistan have 421,600 and 226,100 people, respectively. Myanmar and Laos also have sizable numbers, particularly among naturalized citizens.

The majority of foreign-born residents from the affected countries (60.9 percent) have been in the United States for at least a decade, building their lives and raising families.

These immigrants and their families hold significant economic clout. In 2023 alone, households led by immigrants from the affected countries earned $175.7 billion in income and paid $45.3 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. After taxes, they retained a spending power of $130.4 billion, money used to pay for food, housing, and supplies from American businesses, fueling broader economic activity across the country.

Households headed by Cuban immigrants stood out, with $12.3 billion in tax contributions and $39.6 billion in spending power, followed by households headed by immigrants from Iran and Haiti, who combined paid $17.9 billion in taxes and held $45.8 billion in spending power.

Nearly 95 percent of immigrants from the countries affected by the June 2025 travel ban were employed in 2023, most often in healthcare (16.3 percent), professional services (11.7 percent), transportation and warehousing (11.1 percent), manufacturing (10.3 percent), and retail trade (10.3 percent).

These foreign-born residents were heavily concentrated in a few key states. In 2023, 41.8 percent of immigrants from the affected countries—including both recent arrivals and long-term residents—lived in Florida, an immigrant hub due to its established support networks, economic opportunities, and proximity to countries like Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela.

California, Texas, and New York also have significant populations, together making up nearly a quarter of the immigrant population from the affected countries. The travel ban’s effects—such as family separation, labor shortages, and reduced tax contributions and consumer spending—will be felt most acutely in these regions.

If the administration expands the travel ban to the 36 additional countries listed in the leaked memo, the shocks will be even more far-reaching. About 2.2 million foreign-born residents from those countries lived in the United States in 2023, including 1.4 million naturalized citizens. The following year, households led by these foreign-born residents collectively earned more than $107.3 billion in income, paid $29.1 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $78.1 billion in spending power.

Conclusion

Unlike the public outcry following the first travel ban in 2017, the response to the June 2025 travel ban has been notably subdued. However, this muted reaction does not mean the public approves.

Legal advocates and civil rights organizations remain engaged, but many are stretched thin by a dizzying volume of immigration-related challenges, from visa revocations to arrests and deportations. Additionally, the more deliberate rollout of the June 2025 ban—with exemptions and a publicly announced implementation timeline—has both removed the element of surprise that fueled the 2017 backlash and made the ban harder to successfully challenge in the courts.

However, this quieter reception should not obscure the policy’s far-reaching implications. The expanded scope of the June 2025 ban means it will affect an even larger and more diverse population, and it will bring significant consequences for American families, educational institutions, and labor markets. The absence of mass protests should not be mistaken for the absence of harm.

Furthermore, the ban—and its consequences—may be expanded even further, with 36 more countries under consideration and the potential for more to be added at each mandated 180-day review.

Each country added to the ban compounds the strain on American communities, institutions, and economies. A broad ban not only deepens the economic and humanitarian consequences already observed but also threatens to undermine U.S. diplomatic relations and global standing. This underscores the urgent need to ensure that future decisions are grounded in evidence, aligned with national interests, and mindful of the broader socioeconomic costs.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airport-passengers-1024x385.png,N,,2025-08-07 02:57:03.434336

“A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Washington DC currently operates under “home rule”, established in 1973, which grants the city an elected mayor and council while maintaining ultimate congressional oversight.
The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the federal district, though completely suspending local governance would probably require congressional legislation.
The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed.","Donald Trump is threatening to strip Washington DC of its local governance and place the US capital under direct federal control, citing what he described as rampant youth crime following an alleged assault on a federal employee who worked for the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president said he would “federalize” the city if local authorities failed to address crime, specifically calling for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults.

“Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,” Trump wrote. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run.”

The threat received backing from Elon Musk, after the billionaire described an incident in which a member of the Doge team was allegedly “severely beaten to the point of concussion” while defending a woman from assault in the capital.

“A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC,” Musk posted on X. “A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC.”

The victim was identified by friends and the police as Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old known as “Big Balls”, one of Doge’s most recognizable staffers who joined Doge in January. He reportedly left in June, and is currently employed at the Social Security Administration. According to a police report obtained by Politico, Coristine was assaulted at approximately 3am on Sunday by about 10 juveniles near Dupont Circle.

Police arrested two 15-year-olds from Maryland, a boy and a girl, as they attempted to flee the scene, and charged them with attempted carjacking. A black iPhone 16 valued at $1,000 was reported stolen during the incident.

Trump’s post, which included images of a bloodied and shirtless Coristine, concluded: “If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Washington DC currently operates under “home rule”, established in 1973, which grants the city an elected mayor and council while maintaining ultimate congressional oversight. No president has attempted to revoke this arrangement since its creation.

Trump’s threat could theoretically take several forms. The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the federal district, though completely suspending local governance would probably require congressional legislation. Trump could also deploy federal law enforcement officers or national guard troops under executive authority, as he did during 2020 protests when federal forces cleared Lafayette Square outside the White House over local officials’ objections.

But fully stripping the city’s home rule would probably face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress. Any such move would require congressional legislation that Democrats could block or attempt to challenge in federal courts.

The president targeted DC’s juvenile justice system specifically. “The Law in D.C. must be changed to prosecute these ‘minors’ as adults, and lock them up for a long time, starting at age 14,” he wrote, referring to alleged attackers he described as “local thugs” and putting the word “youths” in quotation marks.

Washington DC, with a population of about 700,000, has seen violent crime decline in the first half of 2025 compared with the previous year, and 2024 marked a 30-year low, according to a pre-Trump January report by the Department of Justice. The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed.

The office of the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined a request for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c7d4709cd11f9a042d85495903f4fab17c50033/240_0_3587_2870/master/3587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b68f4772fae6ec44a999ab424301bede",N,,2025-08-07 02:57:07.708745

The big picture: An April Department of Homeland Security notice stated that recipients were prohibited from ""limiting commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies"" in order to qualify for assistance, but this wording was not included in a later August version outlining the terms and conditions for FEMA applicants.

The latest: The change became apparent after the DHS pushed back on Axios' earlier report on the matter via a post to X.

What they're saying: DHS did not immediately answer Axios' questions on when and why it changed its terms and conditions, but the URL indicates it was in August.

However, a DHS spokesperson told Axios, ""There is no FEMA requirement tied to Israel in any current [Notice of Funding Opportunity]. No states have lost funding, and no new conditions have been imposed.""

The spokesperson added, ""FEMA grants remain governed by existing law and policy and not political litmus tests. DHS will enforce all anti-discrimination laws and policies, including as it relates to the BDS movement, which is expressly grounded in antisemitism. Those who engage in racial discrimination should not receive a single dollar of federal funding.""

State of play: States rely on these funds to cover search-and-rescue equipment, emergency manager salaries and backup power systems, among other expenses, according to a Reuters analysis.

The requirement targets the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led movement advocating for Palestinian rights and ""urges action to pressure Israel to comply with international law,"" per its website.

At least 34 states passed anti-BDS laws between 2014 and 2023, according to a University of Pennsylvania law journal report.

Representatives for emergency and disaster agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment earlier on Monday.

Flashback: President Trump has threatened to withhold disaster relief aid from California over political differences with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Why it matters: The decline followed protests over the waves of raids by masked immigration agents in June — particularly in Southern California — that led to court orders that have hindered some Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, at least for now.
By the numbers: ICE agents booked an average of 990 arrests per day from July 1 to July 27, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).
That was down from an average of 1,224 daily arrests in June — and well short of senior White House adviser Stephen Miller's stated goal of at least 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

Why it matters: The decline followed protests over the waves of raids by masked immigration agents in June — particularly in Southern California — that led to court orders that have hindered some Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, at least for now.

Another factor in the falling arrest numbers: Trump's own flip-flop on whether to pause raids targeting the agriculture and hospitality industries.

Meanwhile, removals of immigrants from the U.S. rose in July to an average of 84 more per day compared to June. NBC News reported that more than 18,000 immigrants were removed in June.

By the numbers: ICE agents booked an average of 990 arrests per day from July 1 to July 27, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).

That was down from an average of 1,224 daily arrests in June — and well short of senior White House adviser Stephen Miller's stated goal of at least 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

The Trump administration appears to have backed off that goal — at least in court.

In a case challenging expedited removals of immigrants, a Justice Department attorney told the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last week that ICE leadership hasn't been directed to meet any numerical quota for arrests, Politico first reported.

The 56,945 people currently in ICE custody also mark a slight decrease from the 57,861 detainees reported four weeks earlier, according to the TRAC data.

State of play: The stepped-up campaign of raids that began in June — dubbed the ""Summer of ICE"" by immigration activists — generated protests across the nation.

The raids, in which masked agents in plain clothes swept into communities to make arrests, left many immigrants no choice but to abandon their children, their vehicles, work tools and family dogs and cats.

U.S. citizens — many of them Latinos — reported being detained for various periods by immigration agents in what critics say were instances of racial profiling and overzealous policing.

Last month, immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of deliberately targeting brown-skinned individuals in Southern California as part of its crackdown.

A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a lower court's order halting many of the tactics the administration has been using in immigration stops and arrests in Southern California.

What they're saying: The Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin confirmed to Axios that arrests were down in July but said they were only down 10% — from 31,000 in June to 27,000.

""Despite a historic number of injunctions — including the (temporary restraining order) in Los Angeles — ICE continues to arrest the worst of the worst,"" McLaughlin said.

""From gang members and terrorists to pedophiles, everyday ICE is removing these barbaric criminal illegal aliens from American communities. Secretary [Kristi] Noem has been clear: nothing will stop us from carrying out the President and American people's mandate to carry out the largest deportation of criminal illegal aliens in American history.""

Variety has reached out to Comedy Central for comment on Homeland Security’s decision to use “South Park” to promote ICE.

It remains unclear whether or not the ICE-related footage in the “South Park” teaser will actually be included in the upcoming episode, as series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone often create new episodes of “South Park” in the days leading up to airtime so they can be as timely as possible. The duo recently admitted that a Season 27 trailer that dropped in April included footage created specifically for the promo and not from actual episodes in the season.

“South Park” Season 27 kicked off July 27 with an explosive episode that made national headlines for targeting Trump. The premiere featured the president begging for sex from Satan and included a Deepfake-assisted PSA where Trump stripped naked. The PSA ends with the slogan: “Trump. His penis is teeny-tiny, but his love for us is large.”

Trump’s White House blasted the “South Park” in a statement after the premiere, saying: “This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”

In responding to the Homeland Security tweet, the official “South Park” X account posted: “Wait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofdicks.”

Yeonsoo Go, 20, reunited with her family Monday night in downtown Manhattan. It comes after Go, who was handcuffed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents upon leaving her visa hearing, spent several days in a facility in Louisiana, according to the ICE database.

Go came to the U.S. in 2021 on a religious dependent visa for children or spouses of religious workers temporarily in the country, Marissa Joseph, Go’s attorney, told NBC News. Go, whose visa had been extended until December, was attempting to renew the visa because her mother had changed employers. It isn’t clear why the student was targeted for detention, Joseph said.

“I’m just so grateful for the support that I’ve had,” Go told the crowd of supporters after she hugged her family.

ICE did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request to comment on the reasons behind Go’s detention. And the Department of Homeland Security did not provide the family a reason for Go’s release, Joseph said. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously described Go in a statement as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed her visa that expired more than two years ago.

Go, who lives in Scarsdale, New York, with her mother, Kyrie Kim, came to the U.S. for Kim’s work. Kim, who became the first woman ordained in the Seoul Diocese of the Anglican Church of Korea, had been invited to develop the Episcopal church’s connection to Asian communities, said Mary Rothwell Davis, an attorney for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, where Go’s mother is a reverend.

“It was an initiative to begin a new ministry, reaching out to Asian clergy, Asian families, and … to help strengthen and grow that aspect of our Episcopal and Anglican community,” Davis said, just hours before Go’s release. “Rev. Kim is the person who was chosen to do that.”

Go, a rising sophomore at Purdue, had a smooth, uneventful visa hearing, Davis said, and was given a date to return to court.

“Everything seemed to go perfectly well,” Davis said. “So she had no idea this was coming. None.”

Davis said she has seen the visa herself and was unsure why McLaughlin had claimed Go overstayed her visa.

“We have no idea why they are alleging this, because we have a piece of paper that says she has a visa till December 2025,” Davis said. “This is what lack of due process does. We have evidence on our side. They’re making allegations. We are not being given the opportunity to sort it out.”

Go’s detention drew massive backlash across faith and local New York communities. Over the weekend, friends, loved ones and more gathered in downtown Manhattan to rally around the student. Davis said that as Go was being transferred to Louisiana from the facility in New York, she caught a glimpse of the supporters.

“She was leaving the building by bus, and she saw the Episcopal Diocese rally that was taking place in front of the courthouse,” Davis, who’s been in constant communication with the family, said. “It was very bittersweet.”

New York Assemblymember Amy Paulin, who spoke to Go on the night of her release, said in a statement that she is “overjoyed” that so many individuals spoke out for Go.

“The pain, fear, and uncertainty she and her family endured over the past five days should never have happened,” Paulin said in the statement. “But tonight we celebrate her freedom and the strength of a community that refused to stay silent.”

Kim told reporters that though she’s relieved that her daughter is back home, it’s also critical to remember that many others continue to contend with circumstances similar to Go’s detention.

“There’s more who need the support,” Kim said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250805-Yeonsoo-Go-ch-1047-e7e5f5.jpg",N,,2025-08-06 08:56:29.720950

DHS’ attempt to cherry-pick Bible verses to justify its policies is a battle it can’t win.","Ostentatious religiosity is often an attempt to overcompensate for some decidedly less-divine behavior. The Trump administration’s draconian deportation regime’s defending such evil with Bible verses is a recent example of this timeless tradition.

Twice in the past month, the Department of Homeland Security has posted Bible-themed propaganda on its social media accounts. Isaiah 6 was the first passage DHS bastardized. As images of helicopters and tactical agents ominously scroll, the narrator says: “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?’ And I said, ‘Here am I; send me.’”

The Department of Homeland Security has posted Bible-themed propaganda on its social media accounts.

The second hype video mirrors the first. Dark images of militaristic immigration enforcement actions are paired with Proverbs 28: “The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.”

In addition to the Bible memes, another recent DHS social media post displayed the painting “American Progress” with the caption “A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending.” The 1872 painting is one the most famous images of Manifest Destiny, which gave a religious justification to the unchecked westward expansion of the United States and the genocide of Indigenous people.

These posts come as DHS begins a hiring spree to add an additional 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel authorized by the megabill Trump signed into law July 4.

Why the sudden biblical references from the militarized Trump immigration machine as it creates a concentration camp in Florida? As the brutal cruelty and injustice behind its actions comes more clearly into view, perhaps it feels the need to give the rank and file a sense of religious fervor.

Imbuing millions of deportations with a divine mandate acts as a sort of pre-emptive pardon for actions that would otherwise be condemned by basic morality. Nothing girds the conscience like saying you’re on a mission from God.

DHS’ Bible craze also arrives at a time when the department is facing increasingly vocal opposition from a broad spectrum of religious groups in the United States.

A growing number of Americans are souring on Trump’s deportation policies, according to an NBC News analysis of recent polling.

A fourth lawsuit from religious groups was filed last week in federal court demanding that ICE stop desecrating houses of worship by storming in to make immigration arrests. There’s already a federal order in place preventing ICE from targeting a group of Baptist, Quaker and Sikh houses of worship on religious freedom grounds. When the National Guard and the Marines were needlessly deployed in Los Angeles, faith groups protested. And Leo XIV, the first American pope, has consistently criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

There is growing pressure on DHS to release two clergy members, Imam Ayman Soliman and Maryland pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal, from immigration detention. Soliman served as a chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital before his asylum status was revoked. Fuentes Espinal pastored for 15 years and was detained for overstaying his visa. A growing number of Americans are souring on Trump’s deportation policies, according to an NBC News analysis of recent polling.

From “Alligator Alcatraz” to a South Africa refugee resettlement plan that reportedly welcomes only white people, the Trump administration’s blatant cruelty stands in stark contrast to the message of welcome consistent across faith traditions.

DHS’ attempt to cherry-pick Bible verses to justify its policies is a battle it can’t win. Anyone who has a basic understanding of the Bible understands that God’s concern for immigrants and refugees is clear throughout Holy Scripture. No fewer than 92 verses in the Old Testament refer to the Hebrew word for immigrant. In the New Testament, Jesus makes it clear that how we welcome immigrants is a reflection of how we would welcome him.

The Trump administration officials who created this propaganda either don’t understand basic concepts in the Bible or are attempting something much more sinister. What if they do understand the consistent call across faith traditions to welcome immigrants? What if they understand it so deeply that they need to create this propaganda to muddy the waters? The religious appeal would then become less than some benign Christian nationalism and morph into a state-sponsored attempt to undermine a core religious teaching.

Let’s be clear: U.S. immigration enforcement agents aren’t on a religious mission.

Let’s be clear: U.S. immigration enforcement agents aren’t on a religious mission. Implying so undermines the secular nature of government. But there’s more going on here: invoking God’s name is a desperate attempt to sanctify an agenda that is abominable.

DHS’ Bible-quoting recruitment video is a confession of moral bankruptcy. A government confident that its policies are just wouldn’t need to borrow God’s authority to sell them. By wrapping itself in scripture, the Trump administration has only confirmed what its critics, including many devout believers, have been saying all along: This deportation crackdown isn’t a divine mandate, it’s a national disgrace, and faith communities will not be fooled into blessing it.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250718-noem-ch-0909-3d7863.jpg",N,,2025-08-06 08:56:35.228883

Gretchen Whitmer published Tuesday is asking her to reject federal grant funding for new immigration enforcement detention centers in Michigan.

The letter was drafted by the No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition following the July announcement of a nationwide support grant program operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with $608 million for the construction of new centers like Florida’s “Alligator Alacatraz.” Opponents have called the facility’s conditions inhumane, but it has been lauded by supporters of President Donald Trump and his administration’s immigration policies.

More ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ centers to be built by states flush with cash, experts predict

With the Florida facility already facing lawsuits challenging rights violations, as well as prisoner reports on the lack of food and water at Alligator Alcatraz, the No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition is asking Whitmer to back away from any deal offering federal money to build new centers in Michigan.

“Conditions such as these are endemic to the U.S. immigration detention system. They will only worsen as the Trump administration continues its push for an unprecedented expansion of the detention and deportation machine, with increasing reports nationwide of death, medical neglect, discrimination, abuse, and punitive transfers,” the letter said. “We know that whatever new prisons are built will come with their own incentives to be filled, and that the continued growth of this cruel apparatus represents a key facet of an emboldened white nationalist program.”

The federal government has already allocated more than $150 billion for immigration enforcement, which includes money to reopen previously-shuttered prisons, including the former North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan.

Now referred to as the North Lake Processing Center, it was a federal immigration-only prison beginning in 2019. It was shut down in 2022 but reopened with an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract in June of this year. The facility is now the largest ICE detention center in the Midwest and one of the largest in the nation.

Advocates noted that immigration raids in Michigan have escalated in frequency in recent months, which trends with the reopening of the Baldwin center. They have also cited Whitmer’s lack of a public commitment to not participate in FEMA’s grant program. The coalition said it had concerns that the state-funded Michigan Works! employment agency has collaborated with the Florida-based GEO Group on hiring staff for the North Lake center.

The letter also urged Whitmer to ensure that Michigan Works! no longer collaborates with GEO Group.

“The Trump administration’s current attempt to weaponize FEMA as an additional tool of mass imprisonment and deportation is emblematic of a white supremacist agenda that prioritizes the sadistic scapegoating of immigrants over the provision of resources needed for all people’s safety and flourishing,” the letter to Whitmer said.

Richard Kessler, a member of the coalition that sent the letter, said the last thing Michigan needs is more prisons – for immigrants or otherwise.

“It’s already unacceptable that Michigan Works! is funneling taxpayer money and resources toward the GEO Group so they can cash in on tearing families apart and locking up our immigrant neighbors in Baldwin,” Kessler said in a statement. “The news about FEMA is another reminder that private prisons aren’t the only problem. What allows companies like GEO to swoop in and profit from suffering is the agenda set by the federal government. And it’s very clear to us that this administration will go after immigrants with whatever methods they can.”

Whitmer’s office deferred comment to the Michigan Department of Corrections.

Jenni Riehle, public information officer, said the North Lake Correctional Facility located in Baldwin is owned and operated by the GEO Group, a privately-owned company.

“The federal Department of Homeland Security has contracted with this facility,” Riehle said. “The facility has never been owned or operated by the State of Michigan, or the Michigan Department of Corrections, and the state of Michigan has no authority over its operations.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6669-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 04:56:40.369931

But that too had to be reworked when the High Court ruled the cohort could not be treated punitively.
In the interim, the government has promised the High Court that the man would not be removed from Australia until his case was resolved.
It is unclear when the High Court will make a judgement in the case.
""It must demonstrate that respect by following this direction from the UN Human Rights Committee and halting these deportations.""","The United Nations has urged Australia to halt plans to deport a man to Nauru while it investigates the human rights implications of his case.

Australia is seeking to deport three people released under the NZYQ decision to the tiny Pacific nation in exchange for an undisclosed payment but their removal has been stalled since February due to court challenges.

The men, one of whom has a prior murder conviction, were among a group of hundreds released into the community following the High Court's dramatic 2023 ruling that their indefinite detention was unlawful.

The United Nations' Human Rights Committee wrote to the Australian government last week requesting the deportation of one of the trio be halted while they consider his complaint to the body, which was submitted days earlier.

It cannot compel the government to follow its direction, which it issued as an interim measure while the matter is under investigation.

""The principle is simple; if your visa is cancelled, you have to leave Australia,"" Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement.

""That's a pretty consistent principle, applied in every functioning immigration system around the world.""

But the Human Rights Law Centre, which is representing the man, argues the government has an international legal responsibility not to deport people to places where they might be killed or suffer inhumane treatment.

Their complaint to the United Nations on behalf of their client argued that sending him to Nauru breached this obligation because he would not be able to access adequate medical treatment, would be separated from his family, could face violence or discrimination and there is no guarantee the Nauruan government would not deport him back to Iraq, where he faces the risk of persecution.

""This insidious plan affects more than just three people. It shows the Albanese government believes that some people in this country deserve fewer rights than others, and deserve repeated, lifelong punishment,"" associate legal director Josephine Langbien said.

""These deportations would set a dangerous new baseline for how all migrants and refugees can be treated. We must demand better from our political leaders.""

Nauru deal first test of new laws

In February, the government announced it had struck a deal with Nauru, which offered to grant visas to members of the NZYQ cohort in exchange for payment.

The group — many of whom were convicted of violent offences but have served their sentences — were previously being kept indefinitely in Australian immigration detention because they had failed character tests but also had no reasonable prospects of deportation.

That was until the high court's landmark decision in the case of one man, identified only as ""NZYQ"", triggered the cohort's release into the community.

The judgement sent the government scrambling to find an alternative solution, which included attempts to monitor the cohort using ankle bracelets and curfews. But that too had to be reworked when the High Court ruled the cohort could not be treated punitively.

Announcing the deal with Nauru, Mr Burke said he expected that more than the three men would eventually be deported after the initial legal challenges were cleared.

It is the first test of the new laws that the government passed last year to strengthen its powers to send people without a visa to a third country for resettlement.

In the interim, the government has promised the High Court that the man would not be removed from Australia until his case was resolved.

Court documents show he was convicted of a crime and sentenced to a total of five years' jail before being released on parole and taken into immigration detention.

His lawyers argue the ruling about his visa was not made lawfully. It is unclear when the High Court will make a judgement in the case.

""The Albanese government claims to respect international law and urges other countries to do the same,"" Ms Langbien said.

The agreement cleared the way, for now, for Mr. Suri to return to his job and life at the university, where he has also taught undergraduates, even as his case challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to remove him from the country moves forward.

Most immediately, the settlement headed off a hearing scheduled for Friday in which Mr. Suri’s lawyers were set to argue that the Trump administration should reinstate records of his legal status in a Department of Homeland Security database and cease efforts to deport him. Officials had terminated those records in March, claiming without evidence that he had worked to spread “Hamas propaganda” on Georgetown’s campus.

Mr. Suri, an Indian national, had previously faced detention in an immigration facility in Texas as one of a handful of prominent students and academics the Trump administration detained in a wave of arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators in March. The arrests and threatened deportations of legal immigrants on campuses have set off a series of court clashes, with judges freeing many of those targeted, and raised fears that the Trump administration is chilling free speech.

Like several others, including Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi, Mr. Suri was abruptly arrested by masked immigration agents and shuttled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a number of facilities in Virginia and Louisiana in what his lawyers have said in court was an attempt to prevent them from immediately locating him.

Unlike some who took on more visible roles in campus demonstrations, Mr. Suri appears to have been arrested based on a vague combination of social media posts and his association with his wife, a U.S. citizen whose father, Ahmed Yousef, formerly served as a senior political adviser to the Hamas leadership in Gaza.

Mr. Suri was never charged with a crime and said in a statement after his arrest that he had “never even been to a protest.”

In May, a federal judge ordered Mr. Suri released from detention in Texas, and a federal appeals court allowed him to remain free while he continued litigation fighting for his ability to remain in the country on constitutional grounds.

By terminating Mr. Suri’s records, the government also jeopardized the legal status of his two children, whose student status remains tied to Mr. Suri’s.

As part of the deal on Tuesday, the government agreed not to terminate his children’s records and to provide at least 21 days’ notice before acting again based on “newly discovered, independent legal grounds” for canceling those records in a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

While Mr. Suri and his contemporaries at other schools who faced arrests on similar grounds have notched a string of legal wins, the more overarching fight over the Trump administration’s student deportation policy is only just now reaching a crescendo.

The question of whether the Trump administration abused its power in seeking to deport a number of like-minded student demonstrators over their criticism of the Israeli government was the focus of a two-week trial before Judge William G. Young in Boston in July.

Lawyers in that case had argued that the administration set a policy of pursuing “ideological deportations” against those students in violation of their freedom of speech and association. The groups suing also filed a post-trial brief summarizing that argument on Tuesday evening.

But Judge Young expressed some skepticism throughout the trial that the Trump administration had misused the narrow but real power afforded to the secretary of state to cancel noncitizens’ visas or even to designate green card holders deportable. He is expected to rule in the coming days.

""The deal that we've struck will allow people with us to send people back to France who have human rights claims”, the culture secretary said.

The “one-in, one out” deal coming into effect on Wednesday will see migrants ineligible to stay in the UK sent back across the Channel, in exchange for taking those who have links to Britain.

But the terms of the treaty indicated that migrants who had arrived in the UK via small boat could frustrate attempts to deport them to France, as the agreement contains a clause that says in order for people to be returned to France the UK must confirm they do not have an “outstanding human rights claim”.

Critics have argued this could risk bogus applications being made to frustrate the deportation process and cause delays.

But speaking to Sky News on Wednesday morning, cabinet minister Lisa Nandy claimed this was not the case, instead saying human rights cases would be heard in France.

""The deal that we've struck will allow people with us to send people back to France who have human rights claims”, the culture secretary said.

“Those claims will be heard in France. So I know that the Conservative Party has been saying that this is a loophole. It isn't, and we're really confident about that.""

However, Home Office sources said that migrants with an ongoing human rights claim would not be removed from the UK until their claim is complete in UK courts.

If, however, a claim hasn’t been commenced then an individual can be removed, with any further legal challenges being dealt with in the French courts.

It is also understood that people with claims that have been ruled as unfounded can be removed even where there is a possibility of future legal challenge.

The row came after shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the treaty offered “an easy loophole for lawyers”, adding that “France will not give us any data on the people they are sending our way… so we have no idea who they really are”.

On Tuesday, borders minister Dame Angela Eagle hit back at his remarks, claiming that the clause was included “precisely to ensure no-one can use ‘clearly unfounded’ human rights claims to avoid being returned”.

She added: “And we will do full security checks on any applicants, and reject anyone who poses a risk.”

The treaty also appears to give France and other EU member states an effective veto over which individuals are returned, as well as stating that the UK will pay all costs of transporting asylum seekers to and from France.

“If France considers that an individual would be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen States...France shall refuse the readmission request”, the document says.

When the agreement was announced by Sir Keir Starmer in joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, the prime minister said it was a “breakthrough moment” which would “turn the tables” on the people smugglers who bring them here.

This week home secretary Yvette Cooper conceded that the accord is not a “silver bullet” to stop small boat crossings, but said it marked a step change as migrants will be sent back across the Channel for the first time.

Speaking to the BBC, she declined to put a number on how many people would be returned under the agreement ahead of time, saying that she believed it could aid criminal gangs.

She added: “We will provide regular updates, people will be able to see how many people are being detained, how many people are being returned, and it is right that we should be transparent around that.”

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal would likely result in only small numbers of migrants being swapped with France and is “not going to make any difference whatsoever”.

Asked whether the Conservatives were partly to blame for the immigration and asylum situation, she told reporters: “No I don’t accept that at all, because what Labour are doing is just rubber-stamping all of the applications and saying they’re processing.”

Bruno Retailleau, France’s interior minister, said the agreement “establishes an experimental mechanism whose goal is clear: to smash the gangs”.

The treaty was ratified on Monday, meaning that anyone entering the UK on a small boat can be detained immediately on arrival and returned to France by the UK government – with the Home Office expecting detentions to begin within days.

The EU Commission, Germany and other member states have also given the green light to the agreement - quashing previous concerns that the bloc could oppose the deal.

Immigration Enforcement have set aside space at immigration removal centres, the government said, while Border Force have an operational strategy ready to identify and process groups of inadmissible migrants for removal.

The Home Office also said it had learnt lessons from the lengthy legal challenges which hampered the Tories’ failed Rwanda scheme, saying it is “prepared to robustly defend any legal challenges to removal within the initial trial phase”.

Labour has put a pledge to crack down on the number of people coming to the UK on small boats at the centre of its plan for government.

But with boat crossings at a record high, and the asylum backlog still above 75,000, there is mounting pressure on ministers to take more drastic action - pressure which is exacerbated by the success of Reform UK in the polls.

Last week figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel topped 25,000 – the earliest point in a calendar year at which the 25,000 mark has been passed since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018.

It comes amid escalating protests across the UK opposing the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with a number of people arrested after a protest outside a hotel in Canary Wharf in London on Sunday.

Massachusetts neighborhoods seeing impact of ICE arrests ICE’s embrace of public arrests is particularly pronounced in Massachusetts.","The Trump administration is apprehending hundreds of immigrants every day across the country – but there’s a stark split in where Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes those arrests in blue states and red states.

In states that voted for President Donald Trump, ICE agents are far more likely to arrest immigrants directly from prisons and jails, a CNN analysis of data from the agency found.

In Democratic-leaning states, by contrast, ICE is frequently arresting immigrants from worksites, streets and mass roundups that have sparked protests and intense backlash in cities such as Los Angeles. Most of those arrested don’t have any criminal record.

The ICE data shows that overall, more immigrants are being arrested in red states than blue states – both in the community and, especially, in prisons and jails. But there is a clear divide in where ICE is apprehending people: 59% of arrests in red states took place in prisons and jails, while 70% of arrests in blue states took place in the community. That partisan gap between red and blue states existed before Trump’s second term began – but it has widened since last year.

Trump officials say the differing tactics are simply a downstream effect of sanctuary policies in many Democratic-controlled states and large cities, which can limit prisons and jails from cooperating with ICE. In many of those states, local authorities can’t hold immigrants in custody based on ICE orders alone – so they’re often released before immigration officials can arrest them.

“Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement,” Trump border czar Tom Homan told reporters last month. “Why is that? Because they won’t let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail.”

But advocates for immigrant rights say the community arrests – from raids at factories and restaurants to surprise detentions at ICE check-ins – are punitive measures aimed at instilling fear in blue states and cities.

The aggressive tactics reflect “a deliberate federal strategy to punish Massachusetts and other immigrant-friendly states for standing up against Trump’s reckless deportation machine,” argued Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, the executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based nonprofit that represents immigrants in court.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on CNN’s analysis.

The divide is especially dramatic in Massachusetts, where 94% of immigrants arrested by ICE were apprehended in the community, and 78% of them had no criminal record.

The state has a court decision and local policies that limit law enforcement from cooperating with ICE. The agency’s regional office was also led until March by Todd Lyons, who is now the acting ICE director, and who has described the focus on community arrests in Massachusetts, his home state, as a direct response to sanctuary policies.

“If sanctuary cities would change their policies and turn these violent criminal aliens over to us, into our custody, instead of releasing them into the public, we would not have to go out to the communities and do this,” Lyons said at a press conference in June.

Regardless of the cause, the varying local laws and ICE tactics are creating a “patchwork system” across the country, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute.

Immigrants are facing “really divergent outcomes based on where people live,” she said.

Different playbooks for arrests

CNN’s analysis is based on ICE records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Deportation Data Project, a research group associated with the UC Berkeley law school. The analysis covers the period since Trump took office through late June.

In its annual reports, ICE defines arrests in two categories: those that happen in prisons and jails, and “at-large” arrests in the community. In prisons and jails, ICE typically sends a detainer request to corrections officials for undocumented inmates, and then agents come to the facilities to arrest them before they leave custody.

Community arrests, by contrast, include everything from workplace raids to teams trailing and apprehending immigrants.

In 2024, under President Joe Biden – whose administration said it was prioritizing arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records – about 62% of ICE arrests were from prisons and jails, while 27% were in the community, the data shows.

So far in Trump’s term, arrests overall are up, and the balance has changed: 49% have been in prisons and jails, and 44% in the community.

But those percentages diverge widely between the 31 states won by Donald Trump and the 19 states won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, which have similar total undocumented populations, according to 2023 estimates from the Center for Migration Studies, a nonprofit.

In the Trump-voting states, ICE is not only more likely to arrest immigrants already in custody, but they’re also more likely to have a record: 41% of those arrested in red states had a prior criminal conviction, compared to 36% of immigrants arrested by ICE in Harris states. Most prior convictions are for lower-level crimes like traffic offenses, immigration violations and other non-violent charges, a CNN analysis of internal ICE data found earlier this summer.

In part, that disparity comes from how states and cities without sanctuary policies respond to ICE detainer requests. In most red states, those detainers are honored, allowing ICE to pick up thousands of undocumented immigrants directly from jail or prison.

But in many blue states and cities, sanctuary policies direct officials to refuse ICE detainer requests without a court warrant. Some states go further in limiting local police’s collaboration with ICE: Boston prevents officers from even asking about immigration status, for example.

The ICE data suggests that some sanctuary policies are blocking the agency from arresting immigrants – to a point.

In Mississippi, for example, which has banned the establishment of sanctuary policies in the state, 87% of immigrants ICE filed a detainer request for through the end of May were later arrested by the agency in prisons and jails. In New York, which has state and local policies limiting cooperation with ICE, only 4% of the immigrants that ICE had requested detainers for were arrested in prisons and jails.

So in blue states, the Trump administration has instead relied more on a different policy: immigration raids and community arrests. In Los Angeles, where those raids sparked unrest earlier this summer, Trump deployed the National Guard. The administration later sued the city for its sanctuary policies, saying the city was contributing to a “lawless and unsafe environment.”

Many activists, though, say the nature of those blue-state raids – and especially ICE’s efforts to promote and publicize them – show they serve a broader purpose beyond just evading sanctuary policies.

Those aggressive tactics are “shocking and they’re such a departure from the norm,” Bush-Joseph said. “But their intent might be more so about deterrence and trying to dissuade people from coming to the US-Mexico border, as well as trying to get people to self-deport.”

Overall, ICE’s arrest and detention machine may just be ramping up. The recent budget reconciliation bill signed by Trump includes billions in new funding for the agency. And a growing number of local and state law enforcement agencies – largely in red states – are signing up for an ICE program that allows them to help enforce immigration laws.

Massachusetts neighborhoods seeing impact of ICE arrests

ICE’s embrace of public arrests is particularly pronounced in Massachusetts.

While Massachusetts doesn’t have a formal sanctuary law at the state level, a 2017 state supreme court ruling bans law enforcement from holding anyone beyond the time they would otherwise be released on the basis of an ICE detainer request. Boston and several other cities also have policies that go further, preventing law enforcement from coordinating with ICE more broadly.

Lyons, the acting ICE director, led the Boston ICE office – which is responsible for arrests in Massachusetts and five other New England states – before being elevated to his current role. In interviews and statements, he’s decried sanctuary policies in the state.

“Boston’s my hometown and it really shocks me that officials all over Massachusetts would rather release sex offenders, fentanyl dealers, drug dealers, human traffickers, and child rapists back into the neighborhoods,” he told reporters this summer – without addressing the fact that a large majority of immigrants arrested in the state this year had no criminal convictions.

In May, ICE carried out what officials described as the largest enforcement operation in the agency’s history, arresting more than 1,400 people in communities across Massachusetts. Around New England, other high-profile cases have included ICE officers detaining a Tufts PhD student who co-wrote a student newspaper op-ed critical of Israel and smashing the window of an immigrant’s car and yanking him out of the passenger seat in front of his wife.

ICE’s aggressive tactics in the region have been defined by “a general level of mean-spiritedness and brutality,” said Daniel Kanstroom, a Boston College law professor who founded the college’s immigration and asylum law clinic. “We’ve never seen masked agents before. We’ve never seen students arrested for writing op-eds before. We’ve never seen people dragged out of immigration court before.”

Stepped-up community arrests are having a marked impact on immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in the Boston area, local advocates say. In suburbs like Chelsea and Everett, which have large Salvadoran and Central American communities, some immigrants are staying home out of fear of ICE raids.

“We’re seeing people not going to their doctor’s appointments, kids not going to school, folks not going grocery shopping,” said Sarang Sekhavat, the chief of staff at the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition. “You’re seeing a lot of businesses in some of these neighborhoods really suffering because people just don’t want to leave home… bustling, active neighborhoods that have become very quiet now.”

ICE’s dragnet has picked up people like Geovani Esau De La Cruz Catalan, who was arrested by immigration agents on the street outside his Chelsea home in June – just days after he crossed the stage at his high school graduation.

The 20-year-old, who has no criminal history, came to the US from Guatemala in 2022. He told CNN his hopes to build a new life in America were dashed when he was detained.

“I thought they were going to take away all the dreams I had,” De La Cruz said in Spanish. “I was in shock.”

De La Cruz spent two weeks in ICE custody before being released with a future immigration court date. His stepmother, Mayra Balderas, said he has a work permit, but it’s unclear whether he’ll be allowed to stay or deported back to Guatemala.

Balderas, an American citizen who immigrated to the US more than three decades ago, said ICE agents were frequently patrolling her Chelsea neighborhood, something she’d never seen before Trump took office.

“Since I’ve been here, I never have any experience like that – going into the neighborhoods and pulling people and doing what they’re doing,” Balderas said. “They are scaring people.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-07-17t173959z-413476354-rc2cofai6u1w-rtrmadp-3-migration-usa-new-york-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-06 04:56:56.328203

A state trial judge and the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal rejected that argument, ruling there was no need to delay adjudication of the case. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that presidents were not immune from lawsuits against themselves while in office.

Trump filed the defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer board, the group that decides who wins Pulitzer prizes, after it bestowed a joint award in 2018 to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their reporting on alleged Russian interference in Trump’s first election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that his investigation uncovered insufficient evidence of collusion between the Russians and Trump campaign, “despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Mueller left unresolved whether Trump committed obstruction of justice.

At trial and before the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals, the Pulitzer board had argued the case should be dismissed or at least halted until Trump leaves office. Trump, who brought the case, argues the case should carry on. Both courts sided with Trump.

“When the president is a willing participant, courts do not risk improperly interfering with the essential functioning of government,” the the 4th DCA concluded.

“The president — by virtue of his exceptional position — is uniquely equipped to determine how to use his time, to assess the attention a lawsuit will require, and to decide whether the lawsuit will divert him from his official business. When an officeholder chooses to initiate litigation, courts must assume the officeholder already has weighed the burdens on their official duties.”

Pulitzer attorneys argue that halting the case would avoid constitutional conflicts they believe could arise from Trump serving as plaintiff in a case that could involve official acts as president.

In a Tuesday filing in the Supreme Court, Trump’s attorneys counter that the high court should decline review because the lower courts “chartered no new territory, the issues are unlikely to recur, and petitioners’ arguments are so obviously wrong.”

“The two courts below resolved Petitioners’ motion to stay the litigation against them on the not-so-novel proposition that a party generally lacks standing to assert the constitutional rights of others,” Trump’s St. Petersburg-based lawyers wrote.

“This Court only has jurisdiction to exercise its discretionary review of a district court’s opinion when the court below ‘construes’ a constitutional provision.

The USDOJ list follows a U.S. Department of Homeland Security list published last May of sanctuary jurisdictions that included 23 of New Mexico’s 33 counties, along with the City of Albuquerque and the City of Santa Fe. That list followed President Donald Trump’s executive order in April requiring such a list.

The DHS list prompted confusion from some jurisdictions and outcry from local sheriffs, and was subsequently taken off line within a few days.

The Department of Justice also published a list of “sanctuary jurisdiction characteristics,” which include public declarations of sanctuary status; local laws or rules limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and restrictions on information about “immigration status of detainees with federal authorities” to name a few. The DOJ notes the jurisdictions included in Tuesday’s list “were made after a thorough review of documented laws, ordinances, and executive directives by the listed jurisdictions. This initial list of designated Sanctuary Jurisdictions will be reviewed regularly, to include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws. Each state, county, and city will have an opportunity to respond to its placement on the list.”

Sanctuary studies

As of the beginning of July, 34 cities and counties, including Chicago and Los Angeles, had asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda, including Albuquerque (Santa Fe is already part of the suit).

Filings for that suit note that Albuquerque “has been a welcoming city” since 2000, when the city council passed “its first immigrant-friendly city resolution,” which states that “municipal resources cannot be used to apprehend individuals solely on the basis of their immigration status, unless required by law.”

On July 21, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller signed an executive order reaffirming the city’s position as an “immigrant-friendly city,” as some members of the City Council said they would push further protections in city ordinances later this year.

New Mexico’s largest city affirms ‘immigrant-friendly’ status

“In the face of federal actions and proposals that undermine human rights and respect, sow fear and destabilization among our families, and damage our economy and threaten our public safety, the City of Albuquerque reaffirms its moral, legal and policy duty to uphold civil rights, public safety and serve all residents with dignity,” Keller said during a signing event for the order.

In a news release announcing the new USDOJ list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement that “sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design. The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

A statement provided to Source NM by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Director of Communications Michael Coleman said the Trump administration’s “designation of Albuquerque as a sanctuary city invites the same kind of federal overreach we’ve seen play out disastrously in cities like Los Angeles. Gov. Lujan Grisham fundamentally opposes this administration’s approach to indiscriminate detention and deportation. It’s cruel, inhumane, and unconstitutional.”

The question remains, Coleman’s statement continued, as to “how the City of Albuquerque plans to manage this situation. Those questions should be directed to the mayor’s office. The Lujan Grisham administration will continue fighting unconstitutional federal overreach in court. But right now, what Albuquerque needs most is for [the Albuquerque Police Department] to focus on real crime in real neighborhoods across the city—not to get pulled into immigration enforcement battles that distract from public safety.”

Source requested comment from Keller on Albuquerque’s inclusion on the list and received a statement from him that said: “Albuquerque is a welcoming city and where crime is now actually going down in every category this year. So we are proving that we are safer and stronger when residents trust law enforcement enough to report crimes, send their kids to school, and seek services without fear.

X’s design choices and opaque practices continue to pose human rights risks that demand greater accountability, not just scrutiny.
Amnesty International is calling for effective regulatory enforcement and robust accountability measures to address the systemic harms created by X’s design choices.","Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, played a central role in the spread of false narratives and harmful content which contributed to racist violence against Muslim and migrant communities in the UK, following the tragic murder of three young girls in the town of Southport, Amnesty International has established in a technical explainer which was published today.

A technical analysis of X’s open-source code (or publicly available software) reveals that its recommender system (or content-ranking algorithms), which drives the “For You” page, systematically prioritizes content that sparks outrage, provokes heated exchanges, reactions and engagement, without adequate safeguards to prevent or mitigate harm.

“Our analysis shows that X’s algorithmic design and policy choices contributed to heightened risks amid a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-migrant violence observed in several locations across the UK last year, and which continues to present a serious human rights risk today,”

Pat de Brún, Head of Big Tech Accountability at Amnesty International.

On 29 July 2024, three young girls – Alice da Silva Aguiar, Bebe King and Elsie Dot Stancombe – were murdered, and 10 others injured, by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana. Within hours of the attack, misinformation and falsehoods about the perpetrator’s identity, religion, and immigration status flooded social media platforms, and were prominent on X.

Amnesty International’s analysis of X’s open-source recommender algorithm uncovered systemic design choices that favour contentious engagement over safety.

X’s algorithmic ranking system, revealed in X’s own source code published in March 2023, reveals that falsehoods, irrespective of their harmfulness, may be prioritised and surface more quickly in timelines than verified information. X’s “heavy ranker” model – the machine-learning system that decides which posts get promoted – prioritizes “conversation” – regardless of the nature of the content. As long as a post drives engagement, the algorithm appears to have no mechanism for assessing the potential for causing harm – at least not until enough users themselves report it. These design features provided fertile ground for inflammatory racist narratives to thrive on X in the wake of the Southport attack.

Further analysis of the system also uncovered built-in amplification biases favouring “Premium” (formerly Blue) verified subscribers whose posts are automatically promoted over those of ordinary users. Before official accounts were shared by authorities, false statements and Islamophobic narratives about the incident began circulating on social media. Hashtags such as #Stabbing and #EnoughisEnough were also used to spread claims falsely suggesting the attacker was a Muslim and/or an asylum-seeker.

An account on X called “Europe Invasion”, known to publish anti-immigrant and Islamophobic content, posted shortly after news of the attack emerged that the suspect was “alleged to be a Muslim immigrant”. That post garnered over four million views. Within 24 hours, all X posts speculating that the perpetrator was Muslim, a refugee, a foreign national, or arrived by boat, were tracked to have an estimated 27 million impressions.

The Southport tragedy occurred in the context of major policy and personnel changes at X. Since Elon Musk’s takeover in late 2022, X has laid off content moderation staff, reinstated previously banned accounts, disbanded Twitter’s Trust and Safety advisory council, fired trust and safety engineers and restored numerous accounts which had been previously banned for hate or harassment, including that of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist better known as Tommy Robinson.

Inflammatory posts

Tommy Robinson told his 840,000 X followers that there was “more evidence to suggest Islam is a mental health issue rather than a religion of peace” further stoking hostility against Muslims.

X’s owner Elon Musk – who has 140 million X followers on his personal account – also notably amplified the false narratives that were exchanged regarding the Southport attack. On 5 August 2024, as the riots were spreading, he commented on a video posted by Ashley St Clair, saying “civil war is inevitable.”

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer intervened, calling for the protection of Muslims amid waves of targeted attacks by mobs on mosques, refugee shelters and Asian, Black and Muslim communities.

In response, Elon Musk publicly retorted: “Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?”

Amnesty International’s analysis shows that in the two weeks following the Southport attack, Tommy Robinson’s posts on X received over 580 million views – an unprecedented reach for a figure banned on most mainstream platforms for breaching hate speech rules.

We wrote to X to share our findings in a letter dated 18 July 2025 and provided the company with an opportunity to respond. The company had not responded by the time of publication.

Time for Accountability

Amnesty International’s analysis of X’s design and policy choices raises serious concerns about how the platform’s recommender system functions in crisis situations. The way the system weighs, ranks, and boosts content, particularly posts that generate heated replies or are shared or created by “blue” or “premium” accounts, can result in harmful material being shared with larger audiences.

“Without effective safeguards, the likelihood increases that inflammatory or hostile posts will gain traction in periods of heightened social tension.

Pat de Brún.

Where such content targets racial, religious and other marginalized groups, this can create serious human rights risks for members of these groups. X’s failure to prevent or adequately mitigate these foreseeable risks constitutes a failure to respect human rights.

Whilst regulatory frameworks such as the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) and the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) now establish legal obligations for platforms to assess and mitigate some systemic risks, these obligations must be robustly enforced to have any effect. X’s design choices and opaque practices continue to pose human rights risks that demand greater accountability, not just scrutiny.

Amnesty International is calling for effective regulatory enforcement and robust accountability measures to address the systemic harms created by X’s design choices. The UK government must also address remaining gaps in the current online safety regime to hold platforms like X accountable for broader harms caused by their algorithms.

A new immigration detention camp just opened in Florida.

The conditions at the camp are, reportedly, “horrible.” Prisoners are denied water and food for long stretches; the food they are given has pests in it. The lights are kept on 24/7, I assume to keep the prisoners awake. Prisoners aren’t allowed to bathe.

Even if you have a zero-tolerance policy toward violating immigration law, that doesn’t automatically justify jailing all your suspects, and it could never justify such conditions. This treatment is unsafe, unsanitary, unconstitutional and unconscionable.

The camp is part of the Trump administration’s policy of mass deportation. The White House set a quota of 3,000 new detainees per day nationwide. Government agents are attempting to meet this target via widespread racial profiling, arresting random brown people off the street —- often with no pre-existing suspicions about their actual immigration status, no evidence demonstrating they require jailing. Legal residents and U.S. citizens have been imprisoned and removed from the country in this dragnet.

But also, many of those arrested who did enter the country illegally have lived here peacefully for years; most have committed no crimes since arriving. In fact, research shows that immigrants generally commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born people, and that crime doesn’t rise (there’s evidence it may actually decrease) in communities where immigrants settle. Nor is crime rising in the U.S overall. Quite the opposite: Crime’s been going down for decades. As Pew Research states: “Both the FBI and [Bureau of Justice Statistics] data show dramatic declines in U.S. violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s.”

So using the supposed “danger of crime”, whether by immigrants or in general, as an excuse for these civil and human rights violations, is deceitful. Worse, it’s fear mongering to justify ethnic cleansing in America. This country’s long pattern of scapegoating and dehumanizing immigrants has been escalated by Trump’s movement to a militarized program of internment.

The agreement contains a clause that says in order for people to be returned to France, the UK must confirm they do not have an “outstanding human rights claim”.

Critics have argued this could risk bogus applications being made to frustrate the deportation process and cause delays.

Mr Philp said on Tuesday this section offered “an easy loophole for lawyers”, adding that “France will not give us any data on the people they are sending our way… so we have no idea who they really are”.

Borders minister Dame Angela said he was wrong, and that the clause was included “precisely to ensure no-one can use ‘clearly unfounded’ human rights claims to avoid being returned”.

She added: “And we will do full security checks on any applicants, and reject anyone who poses a risk.”

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper conceded earlier that the accord is not a “silver bullet” to stop small boat crossings, but marked a step change as migrants will be sent back across the Channel for the first time.

Speaking to the BBC, she declined to put a number on how many people would be returned under the agreement ahead of time, saying that she believed it could aid criminal gangs.

She added: “We will provide regular updates, people will be able to see how many people are being detained, how many people are being returned, and it is right that we should be transparent around that.”

Speaking to reporters earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal would likely result in only small numbers of migrants being swapped with France and is “not going to make any difference whatsoever”.

Asked whether the Conservatives were partly to blame for the immigration and asylum situation, she told reporters: “No I don’t accept that at all, because what Labour are doing is just rubber-stamping all of the applications and saying they’re processing.”

The Tuesday sanctuary list is updated from a May effort that included more of Colorado’s cities and counties.
On Tuesday, El Paso County, which was not included in the most recent sanctuary list, didn’t have anything fresh to say about it.
The lawsuit between the administration and top state and city of Denver officials is ongoing in federal court.","The Trump administration again took aim at Colorado on Tuesday, calling the state a “sanctuary” for people not authorized to be in the country.

In a new list issued by the Justice Department, Colorado and Denver are listed with the designation of “sanctuary jurisdiction,” among 35 counties, cities and states and the District of Columbia nationwide.

And in an updated complaint filed in a lawsuit against Gov. Jared Polis, state Attorney General Phil Weiser, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and the Denver Sheriff Elias Diggins, federal attorneys cited the Caroline Dias Goncalves case as proof the state is still unfriendly to the federal government’s efforts to step up deportations.

Dias Goncalves was pulled over in Mesa County earlier this summer by a sheriff’s deputy, who then notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on a Signal chat that she may be in the country without authorization. She was eventually pulled over by ICE and detained for more than two weeks.

Weiser has since sued that deputy for cooperating with ICE, and the Mesa County Sheriff has sanctioned him, though he criticized state officials for their actions.

The federal government also thinks the state is wrong to seek sanctions against a deputy cooperating with ICE.

“When officers choose to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agencies to keep their communities safe and enforce federal law, the state of Colorado hauls them into court as punishment for doing their jobs,” the updated complaint in USA v. Colorado said.

Federal attorneys also called out a new law passed earlier this year that broadened the group of state and local employees prohibited from sharing Coloradans’ personal information with immigration officials for the purposes of deportation.

Now, in addition to law enforcement officers, pretrial officers and pretrial services office employees are now on the list of employees covered by the statute.

“This hampers local law enforcement’s ability to arrange interviews between federal immigration authorities and inmates,” the lawsuit said. “The … bill severely restricts employees from collecting or sharing information with federal immigration enforcement authorities.”

In the new “sanctuary” list released by the U.S. Department of Justice, the administration argued that state and Denver policies jeopardized the safety of U.S. citizens.

“Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi, in a statement. “The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

Weiser had no comment on the updated list due to the pending litigation. A spokesman for the Denver mayor, Jon Ewing, said, “And here we thought the Trump Administration didn’t like lists!”

“Denver protects the rights of all residents while enforcing federal, state, and local law. Any suggestion otherwise is untrue,” Ewing noted in an email.

The Tuesday sanctuary list is updated from a May effort that included more of Colorado’s cities and counties. Then a number of counties embarked on a heavy lobbying effort to remove themselves from the list, including El Paso County, and it was amended.

Within a short time, the May list was scrapped entirely by the Trump administration and the Justice Department started over. The list currently has no implications beyond the court of public opinion, but could eventually be cited as justification for denying or clawing back federal funds.

The list draws curious distinctions between communities, though every place in Colorado is bound by the same state laws.

Denver does not allow ICE agents to access non-public areas of the jail, for example, as is the policy in several other counties. Denver, like other counties, also won’t hold people beyond the posting of bail or the expiration of their sentences strictly at the request of ICE on civil immigration violations. That’s state law, and it is followed across Colorado. But only Denver, where Trump won less than 21 percent of the vote in the 2024 election and officials have been vocal about welcoming newcomers, was singled out.

On Tuesday, El Paso County, which was not included in the most recent sanctuary list, didn’t have anything fresh to say about it. They re-released a statement from May, when members of Congress and local leaders worked with the Department of Justice to remove themselves from the initial sanctuary list.

“We are working to reverse Colorado’s sanctuary laws, and we are fully collaborating with ICE officials, as state statute allows. Together, we have provided testimony, called attention to the rising crime rate, and fortified El Paso County as an anti-sanctuary,” said spokeswoman Natalie Sosa, in a statement. “Let us be clear, we will not pander to Denver politicians, whose political agenda has made Colorado less safe for everyone.”

Major categories of crime have fallen across the state in recent months, including in Denver.

Garcia said he spotted vans pulling into the store’s parking lot, and began filming as federal agents started breaking the window of a truck with a man sitting behind the wheel. Videos taken by Garcia and other bystanders show several masked men in green vests that read “POLICE” and “U.S. Border Patrol” approach Garcia and tackle him to the ground.

More from Capital & Main

“Give me your fucking hand! You want it, you got it,” one agent said. “You want to go to jail? You got it.”

The agents took Garcia to Dodger Stadium, where he told Capital & Main he was held for hours before being transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A. The federal prison’s basement has been turned into a detention facility for people apprehended by federal immigration enforcement officers, where civil rights advocates say detainees are being kept in grossly overcrowded, dungeon-like conditions. One of the Border Patrol agents who detained Garcia is the same man who was subsequently arrested and charged with assaulting a Long Beach police officer and resisting arrest in a separate incident, according to Capital & Main’s review of the footage. “This matter is under investigation,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to Capital & Main.

“This is a case of Border Patrol and ICE essentially punishing citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights. It goes against the values of this country,” said Ernest Herrera, an attorney at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who is representing Garcia in a claim against Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol, and ICE. “It looks more like the behavior of a crackpot military dictatorship in a different country. But it’s here. This is happening right now in our country.”

It’s unclear how many U.S. citizens federal agents have arrested since undertaking a series of immigration raids in Southern California starting in June. Federal officials did not answer Capital & Main’s questions about the detention of U.S. citizens.

“Threats or acts of violence toward law enforcement officers will NOT be tolerated,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, adding that Secretary Kristi Noem “has made it clear: If you threaten or attempt to harm a law enforcement officer, we will find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.”

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the law firm Public Counsel, said that ICE agents are not permitted to detain citizens. “Are they permitted to do that? Absolutely not, absolutely not. But in Los Angeles, citizens … are carrying around their passports in order to substantiate that they are citizens.” Rosenbaum is representing Southern California residents, workers and advocacy groups who are suing the Department of Homeland Security. The complaint alleges that the agency has unconstitutionally arrested and detained people in order to meet arbitrary arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

In a landmark decision in the case on July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that the roving immigration patrols were conducted without reasonable suspicion of lawbreaking, and that the government was denying detainees access to counsel.

In at least three instances reviewed by Capital & Main, Los Angeles Police Department officers were present as federal agents took U.S. citizens into custody. Immigration rights and press freedom advocates have pointed to officers establishing traffic blocks around immigration raids and officers’ brute force during anti-ICE protests as evidence of collaboration with federal immigration agents. The LAPD has prohibited its officers from initiating action to determine someone’s immigration status since 1979.

Many immigration raids and protests have occurred in Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado’s district.

“We don’t want our local government to look like the oppression that’s coming from our federal government. … It may not look like we’re getting a lot of answers and sometimes the answer is we don’t have one yet,” Jurado said of LAPD’s actions.

“This is the way a democracy dies. … Local officials should not be handmaidens to the federal government,” Rosenbaum said.

The Guardian reported that U.S. immigration officers have made false and misleading statements in their reports about several Los Angeles protesters they arrested during protests. The Justice Department has charged at least 26 protesters, but prosecutors have been forced to dismiss at least nine cases.

The ongoing raids led a group of six California Republican state legislators to send a letter to President Donald Trump asking for ICE and DHS to change course.

“We have heard from employers in our districts that recent ICE raids are not only targeting undocumented workers, but also creating widespread fear among other employees, including those with legal immigration status. This fear is driving vital workers out of critical industries, taking California’s affordability crisis and making it even worse for our constituents,” the legislators said in their letter.

“No one wants to be caught up in the pathway of those raids because it could compromise the family as a whole,” California State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh told Capital & Main. “From what we’ve heard and understood is that they don’t want to be exposed to that so they won’t send their children to school or they won’t go to work because they don’t want to be placed in a scenario where the family could be compromised.” She supports removing undocumented people who have been classified as public safety threats, and advocates that California rescind a state law that prevents state and local law enforcement agencies from using their resources to investigate or arrest people for federal immigration enforcement purposes.

Garcia and other citizens who were detained said they and their families are both dealing with considerable trauma.

“My mom was so relieved to see me. She had not slept,” Garcia said. “I’ve had nightmares multiple times of being arrested again. I see a lot of these officers. I know their faces.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23333/download/Cap%20and%20Main%20080525%20home.jpg?cb=026ac4d5fd1dd43bb65d662ebdfefeb6&w=717,N,,2025-08-06 03:56:44.251980

President Donald Trump’s administration argued that Oklahoma state law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to find the statute invalid.

Oklahoma Attorney Gentner Drummond, a Republican, whose office represents the state and public officials in litigation, filed a motion Tuesday in support of the lawsuit.

Attorneys for the Department of Justice argued that the law extends eligibility for in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants while not extending that treatment to U.S. citizens in other states.

“This unequal treatment of Americans is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law, which expressly provides that ‘an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident,’” the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit references executive orders from the Republican president, this year that “emphasize that federal and state governments must not grant greater benefits to individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States than to American citizens.”

Oklahoma is one of 23 states and Washington D.C. that provides in-state tuition and financial aid benefits to undocumented students, according to an analysis by the Higher Education Portal, which is a platform for data, resources and policy analysis regarding immigrant student populations.

Oklahoma law allows requires in-state tuition be offered to anyone who graduates high school in the state and resides in Oklahoma for at least two years prior to graduation.

The lawsuit also argues that under the law, undocumented immigrants are eligible. Students who meet the residency requirements and provide one of Oklahoma’s colleges and universities with their application or a petition to legalize their immigration status can be eligible for state scholarships or financial aid, according to the lawsuit.

Angela Caddell, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said in a statement Tuesday that the Regents are in the process of determining how many students will be impacted.

“The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education will follow federal law,” she said. “State system institutions will determine their next steps in concert with their respective campus governing boards.”

Drummond, in his motion, sided with the Trump administration and requested that the court prevent the state statute from being enforced.

“Today marks the end of a longstanding exploitation of Oklahoma taxpayers, who for many years have subsidized colleges and universities as they provide unlawful benefits to illegal immigrants in the form of in-state tuition,” Drummond said in a statement. “Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trumpdojmarch142025_1-2048x1401.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 03:56:48.315106

SACRAMENTO – Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the California Department of Justice (DOJ) have acted as a first and last line of defense against an onslaught of illegal executive orders, baseless actions, and wholesale dismantling of our government and the rule of law. Today, Attorney General Bonta reported on DOJ’s progress in safeguarding California’s funding, protecting programs and services, and defending California’s values amid ongoing illegal attacks from the Trump Administration. In just over six months, Attorney General Bonta has filed 37 lawsuits, leading or co-leading 23 of them, and separately filed more than 40 amicus briefs in support of other litigation against the Trump Administration. In the 19 cases where he has sought and a district court has ruled on early relief, he’s succeeded in 17 of them, with 13 orders blocking President Trump’s illegal actions currently in effect. He’s also secured concessions and reversals outside of court, including the Department of Education’s recent decision to restore funding it had illegally frozen just days after California filed a lawsuit.

Attorney General Bonta has ensured that roughly $168 billion continued to flow to the state through a single early lawsuit challenging the President’s illegal and sweeping freeze of federal funding. He has also protected an estimated $11.1 billion in federal grant funding from successive targeted efforts by the Trump Administration to terminate, impound, or condition specific funding for education, healthcare, transportation, and more; defended constitutional rights like birthright citizenship and the right to vote; and stopped the dismantling of federal agencies like U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) and AmeriCorps, among other relief to the states. Looking ahead, Attorney General Bonta and CADOJ remain committed to holding the President and his administration accountable each and every time they break the law.

“In his first week in office, President Trump went after a full-third of California’s budget – and we went to court less than 24 hours later and stopped him in his tracks. When the Administration’s first effort to freeze all federal funding to California failed, it changed course, flooding the zone with near-constant attempts to cut off funding like a dangerous and unruly game of wack-a-mole. But this is not a game. We’re talking about people’s livelihoods, their health, their education, and in some cases, even their lives. That’s why every time the President breaks the law, my office stands ready to take him to court,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. “For every dollar we’ve been given by the Governor and the Legislature in Special Session funding, we’ve returned more than $33,600 for the state. I’m proud of my incredible team who has been working around the clock to protect California’s people, values, and resources in the face of relentless attacks. We know that this work is just the beginning, but we are not backing down. Too much is at stake, whether it be school programs for our kids, research for our future, medical care for our sick, or infrastructure that keeps our cars driving and planes in the air. California will continue to fight at every turn to hold the President and his Administration accountable to the Constitution they swore to uphold.”

“California’s early, proactive, and defensive actions have helped California maintain its values in the face of wholesale attacks against our families and communities, while also serving as a backstop against tyrannical actions by President Trump and those who aim to ignore the rule of law,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “As the federal government continues to attack our state, California will keep defending itself, its values, and its people.”

WHAT WE’RE SAVING

1/3 of the State’s Budget: After the Office of Management and Budget issued a directive that purported to freeze nearly $3 trillion in federal funding, Attorney General Bonta led a multistate coalition in filing a lawsuit. He secured an immediate temporary restraining order and subsequent preliminary injunction, preserving roughly $168 billion in federal funding for California, representing about one-third of the State’s budget. These are tax dollars coming back into California, which contributes to the federal budget as a net-donor state.

Transportation Funding: California receives approximately $7 billion in grant funding from U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) each year to support and maintain the roads, highways, railways, airways, and bridges that connect our communities and carry our residents to their workplaces and their homes. In June, Attorney General Bonta secured a court order blocking the DOT from imposing unlawful immigration enforcement conditions on this grant funding.

Education Funding: Attorney General Bonta protected $939 million for California schools last week when the U.S. Department of Education reversed its decision to withhold vital education funding just weeks before the school year was set to start in the face of a multistate lawsuit. This funding supports key programs for after school and summer learning, teacher preparation, and to support students learning English.

Public Health Funding: Attorney General Bonta also protected approximately $11 billion in critical public health funding nationwide, including roughly $972 million for California through litigation challenging and subsequent court orders blocking the abrupt termination of federal funding for grants that provide essential support for a wide range of urgent public health needs, including identifying, tracking, and addressing infectious diseases; ensuring access to immunizations; and modernizing critical public health infrastructure.

Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Funding: After the Trump Administration sought to withhold billions of dollars in funding approved by bipartisan majorities in Congress for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Attorney General Bonta filed a lawsuit and secured a court order restoring more than $300 million in funding previously awarded to California.

WHAT’S AT STAKE

Stopping the Dismantling of the Federal Government: From his first days in office, President Trump has made clear his desire to eliminate many federal agencies and has sought to do so by dismantling the federal government from within. Attorney General Bonta has fought to halt these efforts, securing court orders restoring AmeriCorps programs and funding; blocking the mass firing and restructuring of HHS; and reversing the dismantling of several smaller agencies including the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

Defending Birthright Citizenship: In the Attorney General’s first case against the second Trump Administration, just one day after President Trump took office, he filed a lawsuit challenging the President’s unconstitutional executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. At stake are an estimated 24,500 children born in California each year that would be denied the citizenship they are entitled to under the U.S. Constitution. Attorney General Bonta, with a coalition of attorneys general from across the country, has won multiple court orders barring implementation of this order nationwide while litigation continues.

Safeguarding California’s Sensitive Private Data: Attorney General Bonta has filed multiple lawsuits to protect Californians’ personal and private data from misuse by the federal government. He secured a court order blocking the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Americans’ financial data; sued the Trump Administration for illegally sharing Medicaid data with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and challenged the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s illegal demands that states turn over the sensitive and personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients.

OTHER WORK

Filing Amicus Briefs: Attorney General Bonta has filed more than 40 amicus briefs, including briefs defending law firms against President Trump’s retaliatory attacks; pushing back against the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal agencies; demanding ICE end unconstitutional immigration stops in Los Angeles; and standing up for our immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities.

Sharing Guidance: Attorney General Bonta issued guidance to law enforcement, prosecutors, public institutions, school officials, and more to assist them in complying with state laws like SB 54, which limits the use of state and local resources for immigration enforcement.

Issuing Consumer Alerts: Attorney General Bonta is committed to ensuring that Californians understand their rights and protections under state law in the face of the Trump Administration’s attacks. The Attorney General has issued a number of consumer alerts helping immigrants understand their rights and the public to avoid notario fraud and other scams, watch out for fake ICE officers, and understand tenant protections.

Providing Resources: Attorney General Bonta and a multistate coalition advised businesses and nonprofits of the ongoing viability and importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives. A similar coalition issued separate guidance clarifying that despite the Trump Administration’s recent efforts to mislabel and undermine these critical efforts, public and private entities can still lawfully engage in environmental justice work.",https://oag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/og-link-card-24.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:08.448867

As part of that allocation, the Legislature required that Bonta provide regular reports on how the money is spent.
They also challenged Trump administration efforts to end birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and restrict voting access in California, among other things.
On Friday, Bonta’s office filed its 37th lawsuit, challenging the administration’s efforts to block gender-affirming care for transgender youths nationwide.
California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times, and knew it would need to sue the second Trump administration too.","California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said Monday that his office has spent more than $5 million fighting the Trump administration in court over the last six months, but saved the state nearly $170 billion.

“That means that for every one dollar we’ve been given by the Legislature and the governor from special session funding to do this work — and we are very grateful for that funding — we’ve returned $33,600 for the state,” Bonta said during an afternoon news conference alongside Gov. Gavin Newsom. “Just to put it in perspective, if you told a Wall Street investor they’d get a $33,000 return on every one dollar invested, they would trip over themselves to get in on that deal.”

Bonta’s calculations are based on a mountain of litigation his office has filed against the administration since President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, including 37 lawsuits — many alongside other liberal-led states — and 47 amicus briefs backing other litigants’ lawsuits against the administration.

The vast majority of the savings Bonta claimed were the result of one particular lawsuit, in which California and other states successfully challenged a Trump administration effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal funding to the states — including what Bonta said was $168 billion for California alone.

“In his first week in office, President Trump went after a full third of California’s budget — and we went to court less than 24 hours later and stopped him in his tracks,” Bonta said.

Bonta also cited court orders his office has won protecting $7 billion in transportation funding to maintain roads, highways, bridges and other infrastructure; $939 million in education funding for after-school and summer learning and teacher preparation; $972 million in healthcare funding for identifying, tracking and addressing infectious diseases, ensuring immunizations and modernizing public health infrastructure; and $300 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. However, it has previously derided California’s efforts to block Trump’s agenda in the courts. Last month, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Times that Newsom was “destroying” the state and that Trump has been trying to “step in and save Californians from Gavin’s incompetence.”

The state Legislature during a special session in February allocated Bonta’s office an extra $25 million to staff up and fight Trump in court. As part of that allocation, the Legislature required that Bonta provide regular reports on how the money is spent. Bonta and Newsom’s news conference Monday followed the first of those reports being submitted to lawmakers.

Bonta said much of the $5 million his office has spent to date was used to pay for in-house attorneys and paralegals, and that none has been spent on outside counsel. He also said that, given the pace and scope of the work to date, his office will eventually need more funding.

“We’re grateful for the $25 million and the ability to draw down that $5 million so far. We do think we will need more going into the future, and I’m hopeful that through the conversations that we have — talking about what we would use it for, our success so far, what the continuing threats are down the road — that we’ll get to a place that will work for everybody,” Bonta said.

Newsom, citing Bonta’s financially consequential wins in court already, promised he’ll get the funding.

“Let me assure you, he will not be in need of resources to do his job,” Newsom said. “This report only highlights why I feel very confident in his ability to execute and to deliver results for the people of this state.”

Bonta’s report outlined 36 lawsuits his office had brought against the Trump administration through Wednesday. Those lawsuits challenged Trump’s efforts to slash the federal workforce, cut healthcare funding and research, dismantle the Department of Education and reduce education funding. They also challenged Trump administration efforts to end birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and restrict voting access in California, among other things.

On Friday, Bonta’s office filed its 37th lawsuit, challenging the administration’s efforts to block gender-affirming care for transgender youths nationwide.

Newsom said Bonta’s work to date shows exactly why it was necessary for him and other California leaders to call a special session and allocate the additional funds. California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times, and knew it would need to sue the second Trump administration too.

“We were mindful that past is prologue,” Newsom said, and the added resources provided to Bonta’s office “have come to bear great fruit.”

Bonta said there is no time to slow down now as the Trump administration continues to violate the law, and that his team is ready to keep fighting.

“We know that this work is just the beginning,” he said, “but we are not backing down.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/694eafc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2F07%2F0d007d784dd49f0a43cb49300e8d%2F1497898-me-bonta-office-behind-the-scenes-05-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:12.792252

Harris learned she was fired for a third time during her daughter’s high school graduation. It was a gut punch, she said, on what was meant to be a happy occasion.

The former chairwoman of an obscure but critical panel that mediates federal employee discipline, Ms. Harris was among an early slate of federal employees President Trump fired without cause. She sued the administration and went through four months of employment limbo before the Supreme Court ordered that she remain fired while her case wound through the legal system.

“Right now, I’m really laser-focused on getting my case to a win, however long it takes,” Ms. Harris said in a recent interview.

As she carves a path expected to lead back to the Supreme Court, she has added a new law firm to her team of lawyers. The four-lawyer firm, called the Washington Litigation Group, is the latest to join a coterie of pro bono organizations that have emerged in recent months to challenge the Trump administration, which is already facing about 375 lawsuits, according to The Times’s latest count.

The firm plans to focus on clients with cases likely headed to the appeals process with the potential to set precedents strengthening civil service protections and reining in executive power. Two of its lawyers, James I. Pearce and Mary Dohrmann, even share Ms. Harris’s experience of being fired by Mr. Trump. Mr. Pearce and Ms. Dohrmann were fired from the Justice Department in January because of their work on Jack Smith’s special counsel team investigating Mr. Trump.

The new group aims to bring appellate expertise to the very beginning of a client’s case, an approach that its founders say will improve the odds of making a successful argument before the Supreme Court.

It’s a game plan straight out of the Big Law playbook. But when many large firms receded from this type of work to avoid drawing Mr. Trump’s wrath, it created a void.

“Our purpose is to help fill that gap,” said Peter Keisler, one of eight members on the firm’s steering committee.

“We’ve just never before seen this kind of systematic effort by a government to use all possible levers of government power against perceived opponents,” said Mr. Keisler, a founder of the conservative Federalist Society and a former assistant attorney general and acting attorney general for President George W. Bush. The firm is applying for tax-exempt status and is seeking donations from foundation and donors. It has received some initial funding to cover the salaries of the four lawyers, a spokesman said.

The left-leaning group Democracy Forward, one of the biggest nonprofits fighting the Trump administration, has also recognized the gap in appellate expertise. The group is opening its own appellate shop this week, designed to mirror those at the big law firms, and has already hired more than a dozen lawyers, said Skye Perryman, the group’s president. The group is funded by foundations and donations.

The shift in pro bono representation is subtle but potentially significant in the legal challenges against Mr. Trump’s assertions of executive power, including the ability to carry out mass and targeted firings of civil servants and the elimination of federal programs authorized by Congress.

Now is a natural time to start thinking more about appeals, said Jeffrey L. Fisher, a professor at Stanford Law School, where he is a director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic.

“Once the cases get up to the appellate level, that’s when people start to think about which one is going to have the right timing and package of arguments and facts that’s going to be well positioned” for a hearing before the Supreme Court, Mr. Fisher said.

The appeals-focused model was intriguing to Mr. Pearce, one of the firm’s four lawyers who was previously a longtime Justice Department prosecutor. Last year, Mr. Pearce presented the government’s argument in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against Mr. Trump’s claim that he was immune from charges of plotting to subvert the 2020 election. He was among more than a dozen Justice Department lawyers who worked on the two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump who were fired in January.

Mr. Pearce is disputing the firing at the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal employee discipline panel that Ms. Harris served on before her own termination.

“I think that a lot of the fighting will be on the scope and extent of a president’s Article II powers,” Mr. Pearce said, referring to powers outlined in the Constitution. “You see this in the independent board cases. You certainly see it, I think, in my firing and in the firing of other civil servants.”

Those powers are at the heart of the case pursued by Ms. Harris, who argues that the president did not have the authority to fire a member of a congressionally mandated independent board without cause. She said her challenge, as she waits for a decision from the federal appeals court in Washington, was not simply about getting her job back.

“It’s about much bigger principles of democracy and the balance of powers,” she said.

The Supreme Court's most recent term reshaped the legal landscape on immigration, transgender rights, and free speech. But behind the decisions, procedural shifts like limits on nationwide injunctions and expanded use of the emergency docket signal a court increasingly driven by politics.

At the ACLU we believe that information is power, and that informed opinions make a more perfect union. That’s why we’ve taken a hard look inside this Supreme Court term and analyzed what the court’s cases reveal about its values, and how its direction and influence impacts our civil liberties.

In this installment, our legal director, Cecillia Wang, answers your most pressing questions on the Supreme Court.

Some have said the Supreme Court is conservative. Is the Supreme Court affiliated with a political party or ideology?

The Founders designed the Supreme Court to be an independent judicial body, not a political one. Justices are not elected and don’t represent political parties. They are appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate, and hold lifetime appointments. This structure ensures that Supreme Court justices make decisions based solely on the Constitution and the law. But in practice, presidents typically nominate justices based on how their judicial opinions align with an administration’s political beliefs. The Senate confirmation process has also become increasingly partisan.

What is the emergency docket?

The emergency docket refers to cases that reach the court through a request to temporarily block a lower court’s decision from going into effect, or order relief the lower court denied, while litigation continues. It’s possible that more cases could end up on the emergency docket outside of the Supreme Court’s regular term.

The emergency docket was particularly fraught this term because of the large number of cases challenging the Trump administration’s actions. The Supreme Court sided more often with the Trump administration on emergency docket cases, allowing the government to move forward with actions the lower courts said were unlawful.

For example, the Supreme Court issued emergency orders in two of the ACLU’s cases challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to rationalize the detention and deportation of Venezuelan nationals without due process. In Trump v. J.G.G., the court granted the Trump administration’s request to pause a lower court order that blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The court ruled that the case should have been filed in the districts where our clients were detained, not in Washington, D.C. The ACLU then brought 10 new cases in district courts around the country.

The Supreme Court ruled on birthright citizenship. Did it eliminate this constitutional right?

No. The court only considered a technical — but important — question about when federal courts can block a law or policy nationwide, instead of for a particular person or group of people.

The Supreme Court ruled in June that federal judges should tailor injunctions, or blocks on a law, to reflect how the plaintiffs who brought the case are harmed. It disapproved of injunctions that block a law or policy nationwide without making that analysis. While it is clear that certain kinds of nationwide relief are still available under the court’s decision — including injunctions in nationwide “class actions” brought on behalf of groups of people — none of the existing birthright citizenship injunctions fit those molds. The Supreme Court ultimately did not answer the question of whether the existing injunctions were enough, leaving it to the lower courts to decide that.

This opened the door to the possibility that the government could partially enforce Trump’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship, putting thousands of U.S.-born children at risk of being denied their constitutional rights based on the citizenship status of their parents. The ACLU filed a new nationwide class-action case, Barbara v. Trump, seeking a nationwide injunction — so that even if the court orders were cut back, the unconstitutional executive order would not be applied to anyone born in the United States. We won that injunction in early July.

The government continues to try to argue that the executive order is lawful in various courts nationwide, including in its appeal of our first birthright citizenship case, which is being heard by the First Circuit Court of Appeals on August 1. The nationwide injunction in Barbara helps to ensure that babies are not wrongly stripped of their citizenship while the litigation continues.

Why is it important to fight for our rights before the Supreme Court – regardless of how the court rules?

The Supreme Court is the highest court in our nation. It’s charged with ensuring equal justice under the law, as well as upholding rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The court’s decisions shape how our rights are interpreted over the course of generations, and in some cases even centuries. That's why at the ACLU we believe any case we argue before the court has a direct impact on our rights.

For example, in U.S. v Skrmetti, the court ruled against protecting gender-affirming care for minors in Tennessee. Yet this loss still elevates how discriminatory efforts are impacting the trans community and why we must keep fighting to protect LGBTQ individuals in all states, including Tennessee.

A loss can still help lay the groundwork towards shaping a future that better reflects our civil rights and liberties. For example, In 1872, the court upheld a state law barring women from becoming lawyers in Bradwell v. Illinois. The court said that the “natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfit it for many of the occupations of civil life.” A century later, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged a different law that heightened scrutiny towards laws that discriminate based on gender. We’ve come a long way. At the ACLU, we recognize that the path to upholding our civil rights and civil liberties can sometimes be a long and complex one.

If the Supreme Court rules against our rights, what do we do?

The U.S. Supreme Court is not our only option to protect and expand civil liberties and civil rights. State supreme courts have the highest judicial authority in each state and make final decisions on state-based laws targeting constitutional issues. The ACLU launched the State Supreme Court Initiative to fight for the expansion of rights through state supreme courts. With lawyers in every state, the ACLU is dedicated to using state supreme courts to affect change at the state level to, ideally, influence federal or national policies.

The Supreme Court term is over, what happens now?

This term, the court served as an essential check on executive power at key moments. But in several high-profile cases, the justices issued rulings that favored the president. As a result, legal scholars and commentators have raised concerns about “the very real possibility that at least some of the justices . . . are worried about how much capital they have to expend in confrontations with President Trump.”

As the term concludes, attention now shifts to what lies ahead. The court may be in recess, but the constitutional stakes remain high. With the Trump administration continuing to press the boundaries of executive authority, fresh legal battles are all but certain. We expect the administration to continue to pursue its agenda through the emergency docket, forcing the court to act and limiting transparency into its procedures.The next term promises renewed challenges to the separation of powers, individual rights, and the rule of law.

The ACLU will be ready. Already we’ve filed challenges to expand and protect transgender rights, to end Trump’s assault on birthright citizenship and preserve free speech for all. Whether in federal courts or through public advocacy, we will stand at the front lines to defend civil rights and civil liberties from governmental overreach.",https://www.aclu-nm.org/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_og_image_1200x630/public/protest-in-front-of-scotus-s.jpg?itok=4xgE_g-e,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:20.811794

“I was being driven back to school and started talking with the cabdriver, and he said, ‘What do you do?’” the chief justice recalled at Georgetown’s law school in May. “I said, ‘I’m a history major at Harvard.’”

The cabdriver responded that he, too, had been a history major at Harvard.

The exchange was a turning point. “I decided — nothing against cabdrivers — that law school seemed like a reasonable alternative,” Chief Justice Roberts said.

The chief justice might have tried to leave history behind, but it has caught up with him. As the Supreme Court’s decisions increasingly turn on their understanding of the distant past, the number of supporting briefs from historians has exploded and their influence has grown.

Indeed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in 2023 that such filings, which lawyers call amicus briefs, are “probably today the most important kinds of briefing,” considering “the composition of the court and the direction it’s been moving in and its jurisprudence.” She was referring to originalism, which seeks to determine the meaning of the Constitution when it was adopted.

Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, a prominent federal appeals court judge, was already marveling at the beginnings of the phenomenon in a 2009 law review article, noting that “honest-to-goodness historians, as opposed to lawyer historians,” had filed supporting briefs in major Supreme Court cases on the Second Amendment and efforts to combat terrorism.

“By my count (an admittedly rough count),” he wrote, “historians filed more amicus briefs in the last four years than they filed in the preceding seven decades combined.”

Since then, bona fide historians have filed scores of additional briefs, according to a recent study in The Journal of American Constitutional History. And those filings have been cited by the justices at a sharply higher rate than other sorts of supporting briefs, except for those filed by lawyers for the federal government.

“With the rise of history-based arguments at the Supreme Court, we’ve had a rise in briefs filed by actual historians,” said M. Henry Ishitani, who conducted the study. A recent graduate of Yale Law School, he is teaching legal history at the University of Tulsa College of Law while finishing his history dissertation at Yale.

But the intersection of two sets of domains — of history and law, of scholarship and advocacy — can pose challenges.

Richard H. Fallon Jr., a law professor at Harvard who died last month, wrote about them in a 2012 essay prompted by a request to sign a supporting brief on a historical question.

The brief was informative, Professor Fallon wrote, and “its argumentation fell well within the bounds of what lawyers could permissibly say in a brief.”

But he said no.

“The brief’s presentation of the historical evidence bearing on the original understanding was not nuanced or balanced,” he wrote. “A purportedly scholarly book or article that asserted its claims without further qualification would attract derision as one-sided if not misleading.”

“The Oxford Handbook of Legal History” devoted a chapter to an exploration of “why historians often find amicus brief writing so vexed.”

But one of its authors, Sam Erman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the rising influence of historians was heartening.

“Courts take these briefs by historians seriously,” he said. “For all the concern about how courts do bad history and never listen to the historians, actually they do listen to the historians to some degree.”

What they are hearing is a generally liberal message.

“Self-described historians have overwhelmingly chosen to file briefs where they can support progressive causes,” Mr. Ishitani wrote. Indeed, he found, 95 percent of the historians who signed supporting briefs making history-based arguments between 1987 and 2022 took liberal positions.

A far larger number of supporting briefs drawing on history were filed by lawyers and others who did not hold themselves out to be historians. Those briefs were more ideologically mixed.

What accounts for the difference? “Undoubtedly,” Mr. Ishitani wrote, “much of the discrepancy results simply from the demographics of a discipline that reportedly votes around 80 percent Democrat and 4 percent Republican, at least at the academic level.”

Another explanation runs deeper. “Leading originalists have long waged a methodological war with constitutional historians,” Mr. Ishitani wrote. One of those originalists, Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown, has objected to what he called “the priesthood of historians” who claim to have the exclusive ability to “tell us the meaning of our fundamental law.”

That stance, Mr. Ishitani wrote, “connects with the broader populist suspicion against experts that has taken hold in recent decades on the right.”

Professor Erman said the prominent role of history at the Supreme Court has had at least one positive side effect, one that might have steered Chief Justice Roberts in a different direction in his college years.

“In an age when there are declining history majors and a terrible history job market, this is an audience of powerful people that care,” he said, referring to the justices. “It’s created jobs.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/04dc-bar1-fgzl/04dc-bar1-fgzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:25.811392

Affordable housing in California zoning In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto.
“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.","East Palo Alto, like cities across California, has a law on the books that forces developers of new housing projects to foot the bill for the state’s shortage of affordable homes.

New residential projects need to set aside a share of the units they plan to build for lower-income renters and homeowners under the terms of the city’s “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Builders who refuse have to instead pay a fee, ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

An East Palo Alto homeowner filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday challenging the constitutionality of that law, likening it to “extortion” — and he had a little help from the U.S. Supreme Court.

The implications of the lawsuit range far beyond the Bay Area. A 2017 report estimated that 149 cities and counties across California have some form of inclusionary zoning rule, though the specific terms vary. That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country.

Now all that may be on the constitutional chopping block.

The case was filed in federal court in San Francisco by Wesley Yu, a husband and father between jobs, who was planning to build a home and backyard guest cottage for himself and his extended family on a neighboring parcel.

Because Yu was planning to construct two new structures, the city’s inclusionary zoning rules kicked in, requiring him to either sell or rent out one of the units at “affordable” rates or to pay a one-time fee of $54,891 to be deposited in the city’s affordable housing subsidy fund.

The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute.

That case was brought by Placerville septuagenarian, George Sheetz, who contested that the government of El Dorado County had not done enough to justify the $23,420 traffic fee it placed on his home construction project.

Sheetz’s case drew on the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which puts limits on when the government can take private property. Decades of court rulings have said that if a local government wants to base approval of a construction permit on certain conditions, those conditions have to directly relate to the costs associated with the development. A city, for example, might be able to hold off on approving a new dump until a developer pays an environmental clean up fee, but not a fee to fund local arts and recreation.

Courts have also ruled that such “exactions” on private development should be “roughly proportionate” to their cost. That is, the $23,420 that El Dorado County wanted to impose on Sheetz should match the cost of fixing the wear and tear his new home would leave on local roads.

The Supreme Court agreed that these standards ought to apply to the impact fee.

Now Yu and his legal team are asking a federal judge to apply that same rule to inclusionary zoning. For East Palo Alto’s program to pass constitutional muster, the city would have to show that the $54,891 fee or the requirement to set aside new units at a discount relates to and matches the cost that Yu’s development would impose upon the city.

The city won’t be able to show that, said David Deerson, the lead lawyer representing Yu.

“New residential development doesn’t have a negative impact on housing affordability. If anything, it has a positive impact,” he said.

A growingbodyofeconomicresearch has indeed found that local market-rate development puts downward pressure on neighborhood and city-wide rents.

Affordable housing in California zoning

In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto. Requiring private developers to toss in some added affordable housing isn’t an “exaction,” the courts have found, but a standard land-use restriction akin to any other zoning rule.

Whether a city decides it needs more schools, apartment buildings, businesses or, in the case of inclusionary zoning, affordable housing, it has broad power under the constitution to “decide, for the good of the general welfare, that we’re going to require this,” said Mike Rawson, director of litigation at the Public Interest Law Project.

The state Supreme Court ruled as such most recently in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in, a tacit approval.

“They can always change their mind,” said Rawson. “I don’t see a basis for it, though obviously that doesn’t necessarily stop them.”

The composition of the court has changed since 2015, veering sharply to the right. The Sheetz decision from last year has offered new fodder for legal challenges to inclusionary zoning.

“Sheetz really helps out here a lot” in that campaign, said Deerson. He pointed to other challenges in Denver and Teton County, Wyoming. “I would expect them to keep coming.”

Tradeoffs in housing policy

If and when the nation’s highest court takes up the issue of inclusionary zoning, it will be wading into one of the more politically charged debates in housing policy.

Evidence on the impact of these laws is mixed. Requiring private developers to build affordable units can and regularly does result in more local housing options for lower income tenants at no additional cost to taxpayers. By putting affordable and market-rate units side-by-side, they also promote economic and racial integration, supporters argue.

But inclusionary requirements can also make any given housing project less profitable, meaning that fewer units get built, leading to higher prices and rents overall. In housing markets, like California’s, that see relatively little new development, the rate at which these programs add designated affordable units to the housing stock is also quite slow.

That policy debate isn’t relevant to the legal case, which will be fought and won over abstract constitutional principles. But for libertarian-leaning groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, building industry groups and many “Yes In My Backyard” housing development advocates, an end to inclusionary zoning would be a win on both fronts.

“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.
