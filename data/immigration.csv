Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation.","SALT LAKE CITY — Immigration is a big focus of attention across the nation, and several proposals have emerged or are in the works for consideration when Utah's 2026 legislative session starts next week.

Most notably, Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, has put forward a proposal that would prevent immigrants in the country illegally from being able to tap into public benefits. The measure, HB88, would potentially make immunizations by public health officials, food at food banks and housing at homeless shelters off limits to the population. ""Benefits and welfare should go to citizens only,"" said Lee, an ardent critic of illegal immigration who also worries about the impact on U.S. culture of other classes of immigrants.

He's also considering legislation to eliminate the state program that lets Utah immigrants who are in the country illegally get driver privilege cards, which allow them to lawfully drive in the state. Another possibility, also in the works, would prohibit landlords and home sellers from renting or selling homes to those in the country illegally.

Other proposals from other lawmakers are in the works as well, including a measure put forward by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, that would add a 2% tax to international remittances by immigrants in the country illegally. Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, is proposing a measure to beef up the rules meant to prevent immigrants from voting in elections. Rep. Matt MacPerson, R-West Valley City, proposes new rules targeting those who drive without a license, which includes immigrants, among others.

Last year was a big year for legislation focused on immigration and immigrants in the country illegally, and it appears the issue is returning for 2026. With the new session starting next Tuesday, Jan. 20, here's a look at some of the measures in the works:

HB88: The measure is modeled after a bill passed by Idaho lawmakers last year, HB135, which, as Lee puts it, ""takes all benefits from illegal immigrants.""

It would require proof of legal residency in the country to access testing at public health facilities for communicable diseases and immunizations. It would also require similar proof for those seeking help at food banks, crisis counseling and lodging at homeless shelters, presumably if the services are provided by state entities.

A critic of the measure, Ciriac Alvarez, senior policy analyst at Voices for Utah Children, said it's not crystal clear exactly how far-reaching HB88 would be. Her group advocates for Utah children, including immigrant children.

Alvarez worries that food banks and homeless shelters that receive state funds could fall under its umbrella and fears its impact on the estimated 100,000 immigrants in the country illegally in Utah and their 59,000 U.S.-born kids. She also wonders whether it would apply to other classes of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and immigrants in the country under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

HB135, the Idaho measure used as a model for HB88, faces a legal challenge and, in the meantime, hasn't gone into effect, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Lee hasn't yet put forward a specific proposal to end access to driving privilege cards. But he's a critic and says he's working on it.

Access to such identification helps immigrants in the country illegally stay and work here, undermining federal laws, Lee said. ""It straight-up rewards breaking the law and costs taxpayers. Utah's one of the only red states doing this — totally clashes with our values. Repeal time!"" he said in an email.

Alvarez said the program also benefits other classes of immigrants, including those with legal parole in the United States. If it's eliminated, she warns that some will still drive.

Lee's idea of a bill to prohibit renting or selling of homes to immigrants in the country illegally is modeled after a measure passed by lawmakers in Tennessee last year, SB392, he said. That measure also faces a legal challenge.

HB141: The measure would require proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency to send money abroad. Lacking such identification, entities wiring the funds would be required to impose a 2% tax on the amount to be sent, money that would go into Utah's general fund.

The tax would potentially apply to the money that immigrants in the United States illegally send to family back in their home countries, known as international remittances. A provision in the bill allows those who have to pay the tax to get a credit for the amount when filing their income taxes.

Gricius, who didn't respond to a query seeking comment, pursued similar legislation last year, HB284, but it stalled as the session came to an end. Remittances by immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, among other countries, are a significant source of income for family and other recipients in their home countries.

HB209: The bill calls for increased steps when people are registering to vote to make sure they are U.S. citizens, not immigrants, who aren't allowed to vote in U.S. elections, whether here legally or illegally.

""As for noncitizens voting, Utah law already makes it illegal. This bill is about tightening safeguards and public confidence, not responding to widespread fraud,"" said Maloy, sponsor of the measure. ""Even rare or inadvertent registrations undermine trust in elections.""

The measure requires presentation of proof of U.S. citizenship when applying to register to vote. Utah's REAL ID state-issued driver's licenses specify whether holders are U.S. citizens or immigrants and could be used to demonstrate citizenship. Voters without Utah REAL ID identity cards, which feature a gold star, ""will have to provide proof of citizenship to the county clerks,"" Maloy said.

The measure also contains a provision allowing for ""targeted review"" of registered voters suspected of not being U.S. citizens.

Utah Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation. She cited at least two reports of noncitizens successfully registering to vote or actually voting in Utah. Maloy ended up as sponsor of the proposal.

HB136: The measure doesn't specifically single out immigrants but allows for seizure of cars operated by people without driver's licenses or driver privilege cards, which includes immigrants, among others.

MacPherson, the bill sponsor, noted 11 fatalities last year on Utah highways involving unlicensed drivers. Moreover, upward of 40% of ""vehicle interactions"" in West Valley City, where he lives, involve unlicensed drivers, he said. The pool of people without licenses includes kids, ""sovereign-citizen types"" and some immigrants, even though they are able to get driver privilege cards if not driver's licenses.

On encountering unlicensed drivers, police are ""stuck without tools to deal with it,"" MacPherson said. ""The best tool is to impound the vehicle. We already impound for DUI, reckless driving, expired registration and a host of other reasons. This gives this tool to law enforcement for this offense as well.""",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3140/314053/31405347.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2026-01-19 23:57:50.683576

ChongLy Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen who goes by the name Scott, was returned home later on Sunday without explanation or apology, he said.

""I was praying. I was like, God, please help me, I didn't do anything wrong. Why do they do this to me? Without my clothes on,"" Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, told Reuters from his home on Monday, while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Pictures of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket taken by a Reuters photographer and bystanders spread on social media, further fueling concern that federal law enforcement officers were exceeding their authority as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen some 3,000 officers deployed in the Minneapolis area.

A statement published by the family called the incident ""unnecessary, degrading, and deeply traumatizing."" The highest temperature in Saint Paul on Sunday was 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius).

The Department of Homeland Security said officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

""He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

'WHY ARE WE HERE'

DHS published wanted posters for two men targeted in the investigation who were still at large, describing each as a ""criminal illegal alien"" from Laos who is subject to deportation orders. One of the men in the wanted posters previously lived at the house but moved out, according to relatives close to the situation, who described him as the ex-husband of a member of the Thao family.

A U.S. District Judge in Minnesota on Friday issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would ""chill"" an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest.

""That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics,"" Judge Katherine Menendez wrote.

The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was four-years-old and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During the ordeal, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said that he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his four-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After taking his fingerprints and a head shot in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

""We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have a safe place to live,"" he said. ""If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?""

""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.","WASHINGTON — The Justice Department ""will pursue charges"" related to a protest in a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said Monday, specifically calling out ex-CNN journalist Don Lemon for his coverage of the event.

In an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson, Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said journalism is not a ""shield"" from a ""criminal conspiracy.""

""Don Lemon himself has come out and said he knew exactly what was going to happen inside that facility,"" Dhillon said on “The Benny Show.” ""He went into the facility, and then he began — quote, unquote — 'committing journalism,' as if that’s sort of a shield from being a part, an embedded part, of a criminal conspiracy. It isn’t.""

Dhillon did not confirm whether the Justice Department would pursue charges against Lemon in particular. NBC News has asked the Justice Department and the place of worship, Cities Church, for comment.

Reached for a response to Dhillon's remarks, Lemon said in an email that ""it’s notable that I’ve been cast as the face of a protest I was covering as a journalist — especially since I wasn’t the only reporter there.""

""That framing is telling,"" he said. ""What’s even more telling is the barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs, directed at me online by MAGA supporters and amplified by parts of the right-wing press.""

Lemon said he stood by his reporting.

""If this much time and energy is going to be spent manufacturing outrage, it would be far better used investigating the tragic death of Renee Nicole Good — the very issue that brought people into the streets in the first place,"" he wrote, referring to the woman who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer this month.

Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""

""Come next Sunday, nobody should think in the United States that they're going to be able to get away with this,"" she said. ""Everyone in the protest community needs to know that the fullest force of the federal government is going to come down and prevent this from happening and put people away for a long, long time.""

In a video posted on his digital talk show’s YouTube channel, Lemon stands outside with protesters while he explains that he is at an “operation that is a secret.”

Speaking to Lemon, one of the protesters, Nekima Levy Armstrong, refers to the protest as “Operation Pull Up."" She says the protesters are “demanding justice for Renee Good and letting them know that this will not stand.”

In a later clip of the protest inside the church, Lemon says, “We’re not part of the activists, but we’re here just reporting on them.”

Lemon reported that activists had gone to the church because, they alleged, one of its officials worked at the local ICE field office. NBC News has not verified a connection.

Dhillon said Sunday afternoon on X that the Justice Department was ""investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers,"" referring to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The law, enacted in 1994, prohibits interfering with or obstructing people from seeking reproductive health services or exercising religious freedom at places of worship.

In her interview with Johnson, Dhillon also mentioned the possibility of invoking the Enforcement Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which was passed during Reconstruction to protect Black Americans' civil rights.

""Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,"" she said.

Protesters can face restrictions on private property without the consent of the property owner.

A livestream posted on the Black Lives Matter Minnesota Facebook page showed protesters at the church Sunday chanting “ICE out” and “Renee Good.”

During the protest, Lemon reported from inside the church, interviewing a pastor who asked him to leave the building unless he was there to worship.

""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.

Tensions and anti-ICE protests have grown in the aftermath of Good's killing in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. The administration has sided with Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot her, arguing that he acted in self-defense. Protesters and Minnesota officials have slammed ICE, calling on the administration to remove its personnel.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests, which Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said would be ""a shocking step.""

""In Minneapolis, we’re not going to be intimidated,"" Frey said in an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""We’re not backing down.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260119-Don-Lemon-Harmeet-Dhillon-rs-79c13a.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 23:58:05.151035

Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.","Central Florida officials and immigrant advocates on Monday criticized a possible new ICE detention facility here as the region sees a surge in undocumented immigrants arrests.

At a press conference at Hope CommUnity Center in Apopka, Executive Director Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet and Central Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost joined others condemning the potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at a warehouse in east Orlando.

“The people of Orange County, of Orlando and of Florida’s 10th congressional district do not want, and we reject, an ICE detention facility,” Frost said.

While there already is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a new processing facility could further ramp up immigration detention efforts. The facility may be part of a national plan, first reported last month by The Washington Post, to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country.

“Let’s be clear about what’s going on across the nation,” Frost said. “They’re shopping around warehouses. This is one of many they’re looking at opening.”

As of Monday morning, roughly 183 people were detained in the Orange County Jail on an ICE hold without any local charges, but that number is likely higher when those held on minor criminal violations like traffic stops are accounted for, Rep. Anna Eskamani said.

“It’s very high,” Eskamani said of the number of people arrested. “When I visited the jail a few months ago it was at most 40 people under just ICE holds, so that’s substantially more.”

The surge in local arrests comes amid the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Minneapolis to quell immigration protests there after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in a vehicle. Those at Monday’s news conference warned that Orlando could be the Trump administration’s next target in its immigration crackdown.

“We are seeing exactly what we have seen across the country,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “We have heard from U.S. citizens that have been followed for several miles on the highway.”

Sousa-Lazaballet said ICE operations have increased locally and his organization is receiving roughly 60 calls per day, up from five, from family members of those arrested.

On Friday, Hope CommUnity Center said in a statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours. A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total because about 300 people had been booked in December.

WKMG and WFTV reported that ICE representatives toured a 439,000-square-foot east Orlando warehouse on Friday. It is zoned for industrial use and may require a zoning change if it’s pursued as an immigration facility. The Orlando City Council may have to approve such a change, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.

“This is a logistical issue as much as it’s a humanitarian issue,” Wilson said. “If local government based on the Florida constitution is where we look at that permitting, we look at that use and the underlying land use, and we scrutinize this.”

State Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis called everyone to peacefully protest ICE and said Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a day to remember what he stood for.

“If you are safe, you should be standing with those who are not,” Bracy Davis said. “Dr. King reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice, but it bends faster when the dissatisfied pick it up, put it to work.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TOS-L-ICE-presser-01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2026-01-19 19:57:53.337006

Victor Manuel Diaz dies in ICE custody

The backstory:

ICE says contract security staff found Victor Manuel Diaz unconscious in his room at Camp East Montana. Medical staff on site were immediately notified and began life-saving measures. El Paso EMS was called at 3:35 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes later to continue efforts. Diaz was pronounced dead at 4:09 p.m. on Jan. 14.

Diaz had been in ICE custody since Jan. 6 after being arrested in Minneapolis for an immigration violation. He had entered the United States illegally on March 26, 2024, and was ordered removed in absentia by an immigration judge in August if 2025.

Cause of death under investigation

What we know:

ICE says Diaz's death is presumed to be a suicide, though the official cause is still being investigated.

ICE has protocols in place to report in-custody deaths, which include notifying Congress, stakeholders and the media. Reports are also made available on ICE's public website within 90 days. Federal officials released the following statement:

""ICE emphasizes that all detainees receive comprehensive medical care, including screenings and access to emergency services. They assert that no detained individual is denied emergency care during their stay.""

Tina Smith, Jason Chavez react

What they're saying:

U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Jason Chavez of the Minneapolis City Council issued statements on the man's death via social media.

""Hearing reports that a man taken by ICE in Minneapolis died in federal custody. This is another senseless tragedy, ICE has an obligation to keep detainees safe,"" Smith said on X. ""We need a complete and impartial investigation of what is happening in these detention centers.""

""Rest in peace Victor Manuel Diaz. He was a Latino immigrant kidnapped by ICE in Minneapolis. He died in ICE custody at Camp East Montana, Texas while facing deportation. We have unjust immigration system that continues to take the lives of our neighbors while tearing families apart. Camp East Montana, is a $1.24 billion privately operated immigration detention facility funded by taxpayers. There are reports of a lack of access to medication and more. This facility needs to shut down,"" Chavez posted to Facebook.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole. On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him.

The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.

Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody this year.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him.

His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide. The local medical examiner determined the preliminary cause of death was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”, according to reports. ICE said he experienced a medical emergency after being “disruptive while in line for medication”.

Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained with him, told the Washington Post that he saw five guards choking him, and that he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he couldn’t breathe.

“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” the publication quoted Flores as saying.

After reports that Lunas Campos’ death might be investigated as a potential homicide, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Guardian that he had tried to kill himself and “violently resisted” officers who were trying to help him.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, also told the Washington Post after it published its article that Lunas Campos was trying to take his own life. The allegation was not part of ICE’s initial statement.

Another Camp East Montana inmate, Francisco Gaspar-Andres, died at a nearby hospital on 3 December. He was 48.

That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing.","Lawyers for the Trump administration said on Monday that they were appealing a judge’s injunction that imposed limits on immigration agents’ interactions with protesters in Minnesota.

In a short notice filed on Monday with the judge who issued the preliminary injunction last week, Justice Department lawyers said they would challenge those limits at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The lawsuit that led to the injunction claimed that federal law enforcement officers had repeatedly violated the rights of protesters who observed or recorded immigration enforcement actions or voiced opposition to those actions.

In her injunction, handed down on Friday, Judge Kate M. Menendez of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered agents not to retaliate against people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity,” and not to use pepper spray or other “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech. The judge also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., did not give the plaintiffs everything they had sought in the injunction. She did not include specific protection for the recording of agents, nor did she impose rules about how agents issue dispersal orders.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the appeal. Though a notice of appeal was filed with the district court, the full text of the appeal was not immediately available from the Eighth Circuit.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on Friday in a statement responding to Judge Menendez’s injunction that “D.H.S. is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

She added that despite “grave threats,” agents had “followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public and federal property.”

A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, which backed the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the appeal.

The lawsuit described a “federal campaign to besiege cities across the United States in an unprecedented attack on civil liberties,” and described the case as an effort “to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document, and criticize defendants’ activities, safely and unburdened by the fear of retaliation.”

The suit is one of several filed in recent weeks related to the surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota. The enforcement campaign has led to at least 2,400 arrests, as well as repeated clashes with protesters and two shootings, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a U.S. citizen who was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. In another incident in Minneapolis last week, a federal agent shot and injured a man who officials said was in the country illegally and had assaulted an agent with a shovel or broom.

Judge Menendez is weighing a separate lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing. The state asked Judge Menendez to issue an immediate ruling in that case, but she declined last week to do so.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:57:55.073250

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term.
Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.
The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook.
In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered.","The Supreme Court’s review this week of President Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve was always going to pose a key test of how much leeway the justices would give the president to remake and control the central bank.

Then the Justice Department issued subpoenas this month as part of a criminal investigation into the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.

Legal experts said that development threatened to complicate the Trump administration’s case, making a potentially difficult-to-win case even more challenging.

Mr. Trump’s solicitor general will argue to the court on Wednesday that the president had a valid reason to fire Lisa Cook, who has been a Fed governor since 2022, because she allegedly engaged in mortgage fraud. She sued after Mr. Trump tried to oust her in August, arguing that the law that established the Fed allowed presidents to dismiss members only “for cause.”

Ms. Cook, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, denies the allegations, which relate to loan documents she signed before joining the Fed.

Analysts say the Powell subpoenas could bolster the sense that the Trump administration ginned up a pretext to oust Ms. Cook as a way to force the central bank to lower borrowing costs.

The move against Mr. Powell “undermines the administration’s contention that this is all about Lisa Cook’s conduct and not about her votes on monetary policy,” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor who is closely tracking the case.

“It all tends to suggest that the goal here is to take over the Fed,” he said.

Mr. Powell will attend Wednesday’s arguments, along with Ms. Cook, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Central bank governors serve staggered 14-year terms “unless sooner removed for cause by the president,” according to federal law. Congress put those protections in place in 1913 and renewed them in 1935 to ensure the independence of the institution and allow officials to set monetary policy without political interference from the president.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Powell misled Congress when questioned in June about extensive renovations of the Fed’s headquarters in Washington that are running hundreds of millions of dollars over budget.

Mr. Powell has aggressively pushed back, saying the investigation is a “consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

That is the same argument Ms. Cook’s lawyers will make during Wednesday’s argument. In filings, they have said the mortgage fraud allegation is “paper-thin, unproven” and a “manufactured” pretext for policy disagreements.

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term. Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.

Despite his complaints about Mr. Powell, the president moved to fire Ms. Cook, a nominee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., citing the allegations that she falsified bank documents to acquire more favorable loan terms.

Former top Fed and Treasury officials and Ms. Cook’s legal team have warned the Supreme Court that permitting Mr. Trump to fire her while her litigation is underway would spur economic turmoil and undermine public confidence in the central bank.

The Justice Department argues that Mr. Trump has cited a “cause” to fire Ms. Cook, and that the court cannot second-guess the specific reason the president has identified.

How much discretion presidents have to remove Fed officials, what counts as cause, and whether officials are entitled to notice and process before being ousted will be key questions for the justices at Wednesday’s argument.

The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook. That distinguishes the case from one the Supreme Court heard in December, in which the administration argued that laws requiring the president to identify a rationale before firing other independent regulators infringed on the president’s constitutional authority.

The Supreme Court has been overwhelmingly receptive to Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove regulators from other independent agencies. But the justices have repeatedly signaled that they view the Fed differently.

In cases involving the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Trade Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the justices allowed Mr. Trump to fire officials while their litigation was underway, despite congressionally imposed limits on the president’s removal power.

In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered. The justices also went out of their way to suggest that the Fed may stand apart from other agencies, writing in an order in May that it is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” with a distinct history.

The newly revealed subpoenas and investigation into Mr. Powell are not officially part of the record before the Supreme Court in Ms. Cook’s case, but experts said atmospherics can matter.

In April 2004, photographs showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib were published the same day the court heard a challenge to the Bush administration’s detention of “enemy combatants” at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The court ultimately ruled against the administration, saying those deemed enemy combatants must be able to challenge their detention before a judge or other “neutral decision maker.”

“That’s not what you want the justices reading about the morning of your argument,” Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William and Mary, said of the government’s lawyers in that case. “You want to be right on the law, but it certainly helps to have atmospherics on your side.”

Those atmospherics could play a role as the justices decide how much flexibility Mr. Trump has to get rid of Ms. Cook before her term expires.

Jennifer Nou, a University of Chicago law professor, said the court ordinarily gave broad discretion to such executive branch judgments. But she pointed to a case during Mr. Trump’s first term that showed that the justices would sometimes reject what they viewed as a made-up rationale by the president or his top advisers.

In 2019, the court rejected the administration’s justification for adding a question about citizenship status to the census. The court said the commerce secretary had not been upfront when he told Congress he acted “solely” in response to a Justice Department request. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the explanation “appears to have been contrived” and that the secretary “was determined” to add the question.

The census decision “can be broadly understood to stand for the proposition that the court does not take pretext lightly,” Ms. Nou said, and “can’t be blinded to the real world.”

The revelations about the U.S. attorney’s investigation into whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress could bolster Ms. Cook’s argument, experts said.",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,N,,2026-01-19 16:58:04.149920

This kind of cooperation with ICE will only be detrimental to that feeling.","To the Editor:

I am writing to express my concern over the recent resolution to discuss the possibility of the County Sheriff’s department cooperating with ICE by way of a 287(g) agreement. We are seeing a lot of opposition to ICE’s presence in our country. If ICE were pursuing and arresting immigrants with violent criminal records or proven gang affiliation, as was promised by the President, I don’t believe there would be such widespread opposition.

The fact that there is a quota set, and that people who have lived and worked here for years are being targeted, is the reason that citizens are forming groups to watch and even interfere with ICE agents performing their duties.

There is room for a debate over whether we should be deporting people who have no criminal record, but also no legal status. I think almost everyone agrees that our immigration system is badly in need of repair. However, my objection to ICE has much more to do with their tactics. They are masked and without visible ID in many if not all cases—as far as I know that is unacceptable for any law enforcement officer.

I assume that our county deputies will not be masked and will continue to have visible ID, but I’m trying to make a point here about the public sentiment ICE has generated. Their agents are being sent into selected cities in great numbers, outfitted with military gear and weaponry, and are generating an atmosphere, not of safety, but of fear. Incidents like the tragic death in Minneapolis and in other places are bound to happen, as citizens resist these tactics. They are provoking, not protecting.

There is currently a case pending in a state appellate court in Nassau County where the plaintiff is arguing that NY law prevents the police from arresting or detaining people for civil violations of federal immigration law. This is exactly the agreement that is being considered, the 287(g) agreement. My feeling is that the legislature should at the very least wait until this case is decided by the courts. Why put our county in jeopardy of lawsuits unnecessarily, or create the kind of division and anger we see elsewhere in our country?

I think most folks in St Lawrence County appreciate and respect the Sheriff’s department and think of its deputies as neighbors. This kind of cooperation with ICE will only be detrimental to that feeling.

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear SEC vs. Sripetch, et al., a Ninth Circuit decision affirming a disgorgement award despite the SEC’s failure to demonstrate defrauded investors suffered pecuniary harm.1

The Supreme Court limited the SEC’s ability to claim disgorgement in the 2020 decision in Liu v. SEC, finding that disgorgement can be equitable relief if it is confined to the wrongdoer’s illicit net profits and is returned to victims.2 Following Liu, Courts split on pecuniary harm was needed to support a disgorgement award.3 For example, in SEC v. Govil, the Second Circuit concluded a showing of pecuniary harm was required given disgorgement’s equitable limitation that it be “awarded for victims.”4 In reaching the exact opposite conclusion, the First Circuit in SEC v. Navellier & Associates, Inc. held that disgorgement does not require a showing of pecuniary harm so long as disgorgement was “tethered to a wrongdoer’s net unlawful profits.”5 If that threshold is met, courts need not be concerned with a victim’s harm.6

The Court’s resolution in this matter will have wide implications for SEC enforcement, specifically the monetary penalties the SEC may seek both in negotiations and in litigation. If the Court finds pecuniary harm is required, it will further restrict the SEC’s powers.

Stacie Halpern, an attorney representing Palacios, told Eyewitness News that the allegations made against her client were investigated by law enforcement and the Department of Children and Family Services and said ""they were unable to find anything that corroborated the allegations and deemed them unfounded.""

She said Palacios acted in self-defense the night Porter was killed and said he was protecting the neighborhood.

The Department of Homeland Security has also not confirmed whether Palacios was involved in the shooting.

Porter was fatally shot the night of Dec. 31 in the 17700 block of Roscoe Boulevard.

According to a statement from DHS, the ICE agent said he heard gunshots outside of his apartment.

""The suspected gunfire grew progressively louder, indicating to the officer that whoever was firing a gun was approaching his apartment,"" read a statement released by Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS. ""The officer took his ICE authorized firearm and left his apartment to investigate. He moved to the ground level and went outside, where he believed the suspected gunfire was coming from.""

DHS said the agent encountered Porter holding what appeared to be a long rifle and ordered him to put it down.

""The ICE officer identified himself as law enforcement,"" read the DHS statement. ""In response, the individual pointed his weapon at the ICE officer. The officer ordered the subject to put the weapon down. When the subject refused to comply, the officer fired defensively with his service weapon at the subject to disarm him. The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer.""

Porter's family, however, disputes that account, saying his gunfire was part of a New Year's celebration. They are asking for more information as they mourn his death.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18432363_011826-kabc-7a-DHS-northridge-shooting-STRINGER-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:03.228948

Justice department officials accuse the protesters of ""desecrating a house of worship"", and say they will investigate them for civil rights violations.

Anti-ICE protests continue in the state against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, and the Pentagon reportedly placed 1,500 soldiers on standby for possible deployment.

On Sunday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to exercise the ""full force of federal law"" against the demonstrators who interrupted the service at the Cities Church in St Paul, which neighbors Minneapolis.

Later on Monday, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said on X that the justice department ""will pursue federal charges in this case"".

Protesters say that one of the church's eight pastors, David Easterwood, is a local ICE official.

Easterwood was not leading the service on Sunday.

A person by the same name is identified in ACLU court filings as the acting director of the ICE St Paul field office, according to reporting by the Associated Press and the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.

The AP also reported he appeared alongside Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in Minneapolis at a news conference last October.

The BBC has contacted the church for comment.

In a statement, DHS said it does not confirm or deny the identities of its agents as ""publicizing their identities puts their lives and the lives of their families at serious risk"".

Monique Cullars-Doty, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota and one of the protest organisers, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that ""we can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray"".

Elsewhere in the city, protests with occasional clashes have persisted at the Whipple building in Minneapolis where federal agents are headquartered.

A DHS spokesperson said on Monday that at least 3,000 people have been arrested in Minneapolis since the deployments.

On Friday, a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents toward peaceful protesters in Minneapolis.

Thousands of ICE agents are in Minnesota as part of a surge by the Trump administration after his election pledge for the biggest deportation operation of undocumented migrants in history.

On Sunday, CBS News reported that 1,500 active-duty soldiers have been placed on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, after President Trump said he may invoke the Insurrection Act to respond to protests.

The 19th-Century law allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.

Dozens of people rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul Sunday morning, interrupting the church service and leading to tense confrontations, videos posted by activists and content creators show.

“ICE out!” protesters shouted as they were confronted by the lead pastor and congregants.

The demonstrators said they were there to protest David Easterwood, who is listed as a pastor at the church and appears to be the same David Easterwood who is a top ICE official in the Twin Cities. He was recently named as a defendant in a case brought by protesters who allege immigration agents had violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights.

“David Easterwood, out now!” protesters yelled at one point.

None of the videos show Easterwood in the church, and it’s unclear if he was in the building on Sunday. In response to CNN’s inquiry about his connection to ICE, a DHS spokesperson responded, “DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers.”

Federal investigation promised

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced an investigation within hours, calling the protesters’ actions “desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

Dhillon cited the FACE Act, a federal law that “prohibits the use or threat of force and physical obstruction that injures, intimidates, or interferes with a person seeking to … exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.”

A surge in immigration enforcement around Minneapolis, known as Operation Metro Surge, brought thousands of additional federal agents to the area and prompted widespread protests, especially after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, on January 7.

The swift promise to investigate the demonstration stood in contrast to the administration’s response to Good’s death, as the Department of Justice quickly quashed an inquiry and refused to cooperate with local law enforcement agencies on their own investigation.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, a former president of the local NAACP chapter, told The Associated Press she considered the threat of an official investigation a sham.

“If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and they need to check their hearts,” she said.

Cities Church has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment. A St. Paul police vehicle was briefly seen parked outside the building Monday morning, and no one answered when a CNN crew rang the doorbell.

Who is David Easterwood?

The man targeted by protesters Sunday is the acting field office director in St. Paul for Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE. In a declaration filed in this month’s lawsuit by protesters, Easterwood said he has worked for ICE since 2015.

Easterwood argued in his statement any order from the court would “further endanger the safety of law enforcement personnel and the public.”

Judge Katherine Menendez found ICE agents had been overzealous in pulling over some demonstrators who were following agents in vehicles.

“The Court has carefully considered and weighed Director Easterwood’s account of how vehicles have been used by observers to protest ICE activity in the Twin Cities,” Menendez wrote. “But, even crediting his statements about incidents of misconduct among other people following Operation Metro Surge, it simply does not establish reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop as to these particular plaintiffs.”

Despite Easterwood’s testimony, Menendez issued a largely symbolic injunction ordering agents not to detain people “who are engaging in unobtrusive protest activity, including observing the activities of Operation Metro Surge.”

Just days after taking his current position, Easterwood appeared alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a news conference on immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities.

“Our officers demonstrate every day what it means to serve with honor and dedication,” Easterwood said in October.

Easterwood does not have a listed phone number, and requests for comment sent to his office were not immediately answered.

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. She also blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “for whipping these mobs into a frenzy and then allowing them to run rampant.”

With emotions running high and confrontational tactics escalating on both sides, Sunday’s protest highlights the growing tension between protecting free expression and silencing opposing voices.

“The question that we’re coming to is how law enforcement is going to protect the rights of protesters to engage in their First Amendment-protected activity, and at the same time not be intimidating other people for whatever rights they are engaged in,” CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero said.

WATCH: Twin Cities on edge as ICE raids ignite fear and protests

The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.

U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations ""by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.""

""A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!"" she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

""When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,"" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. ""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said. ""We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.""

Can This Lawyer Change That?,"Michael Steinberger, www.nytimes.com, michael-steinberger",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/magazine/genocide-trial-human-right-international-law.html,"“It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says.
At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters.
Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world.
“We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.
He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose.","Despite the carnage in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and even in the face of the Trump administration’s apparent determination to dismantle what remains of the liberal international order, the human rights attorney Philippe Sands insists he is not giving in to despair. “It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says. “It’s a long game.” Coming from Sands, who has devoted most of his career to trying to contain the darkest human impulses, the cautious pessimism is almost encouraging. He concedes, however, that it does feel as if the lessons of the 20th century are being cast aside and that the same sinister spirits that led to Auschwitz, Rwanda and Srebrenica are enjoying a revival. “There is definitely something in the air.”

Sands, who is 65, is among the pre-eminent figures in his field and has taken part in a number of landmark cases. He was a lawyer for Croatia in the genocide claim that it brought against Serbia, helped lay the groundwork for the prosecution of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor and was a member of the legal team that sought to hold the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet accountable for torturing and murdering political opponents. More recently, he was the lead outside counsel in the successful campaign to get Britain to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and argued for Palestinian self-determination in a case before the International Court of Justice. He also played a key role in the establishment of a tribunal to investigate Russia for crimes of aggression against Ukraine. Over the last three decades, few people have done more to shape the direction of international criminal law than Sands.

His latest book, “38 Londres Street,” was recently released in the United States. It recounts the indictment of Pinochet in 1998, his arrest in London and the ultimately unsuccessful quest to make him stand trial. The book, which takes its name from the building in Santiago that housed one of Pinochet’s clandestine torture centers, is also about the relationship between Pinochet and Walter Rauff, a senior SS officer — he developed the mobile gas chambers that the Nazis used to murder around 100,000 people — who fled to Chilean Patagonia after World War II.

The book is well timed. Scenes in the United States of masked law enforcement officers grabbing people off the street have evoked comparisons to Pinochet’s Chile and to Argentina’s Dirty War. Sands, whose wife, Natalia Schiffrin, is American (his brother-in-law is the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz), says there is “at least the embryo of a parallel.” What especially troubles him is the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision granting presidents almost blanket immunity. As Sands asks: “If a president commits crimes against humanity, tortures or disappears people, is he going to be subject to examination by the courts? The answer appears to be no.” Sands fears that the Supreme Court, 80 years after the Nuremberg trials established that political and military leaders could be held accountable for atrocities against their own citizens, has ushered in what he calls a “new age of impunity.”

On the international front, certainly, the Trump administration feels unconstrained by existing laws and norms, a point demonstrated by the U.S. military incursion into Venezuela and acknowledged with disarming candor by the president himself in a subsequent interview with The Times. “I don’t need international law,” Trump said. Amid all this upheaval, Sands is currently arguing another major case before the I.C.J.: He is representing Gambia in the genocide claim that it filed against Myanmar over its treatment of the Rohingya people. The trial opened last week in The Hague and is scheduled to run through the end of the month. If Sands and his colleagues prevail, it will mark the first time that a state has been held responsible for genocide. The I.C.J. has no direct means of enforcing its judgments, however, and in the context of the current moment, the courtroom proceedings might seem like a forlorn attempt to add scaffolding to a collapsing edifice.

Last January, Sands delivered a Holocaust Remembrance Day lecture at the University of Cambridge, his alma mater. Although his work often immerses him in stories of appalling cruelty, he is by nature very cheerful, and he exuded warmth and affability as he reflected on his Cambridge education and talked about his career. He counseled the students against cynicism. He noted that international human rights law was still in its nascency and said he remained optimistic that its core values would ultimately triumph. “I firmly believe that the arc of history will follow the arc of justice,” he said.

But he acknowledged that history seemed to be taking an unfortunate detour. Donald Trump was back in the White House, and Elon Musk had given what many observers interpreted to be a Nazi salute at an inauguration event and had also told a far-right rally in Germany that it was time to move beyond the country’s past, and Sands conceded that it was hard not to feel a sense of foreboding. “This could end very badly,” he said.

He grew up in the shadow of bleak times. His mother, Ruth, is a Holocaust survivor; as a toddler, she was spirited out of Vienna by a Christian missionary named Elsie Tilney and spent several years in France in the care of a series of Catholic families who hid her Jewish identity. Sands was raised in London (he holds British and French citizenship). His father, Allan, was a dentist; Ruth owned a children’s secondhand bookstore. He has a younger brother, Marc, who recently retired as an executive at an art auction house.

Sands entered Cambridge in 1979 intent on studying economics. But he quickly soured on supply-and-demand curves and switched to law. He found that pretty stultifying too, except for the class he took on international law. Although the professor was, in Sands’s words, “a very dry Yorkshireman,” he was enthralled by the subject matter. He says that it was “about all these things that were not talked about at home but were very, very present.”

Upon graduating, he spent a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School. In 1984, he returned to Cambridge to work as a fellow at the university’s Research Center for International Law, which was under the direction of Elihu Lauterpacht, Hersch Lauterpacht’s son, with whom he formed a close bond. At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters. After the breakthroughs at Nuremberg, international criminal law had become largely moribund owing to the exigencies of the Cold War.

By contrast, international environmental law was an emerging subfield full of promise, and Sands became one of its pioneering figures. His foray into environmental law began with a paper that he wrote on transboundary pollution after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. He helped start the Alliance of Small Island States, which has been at the forefront of the battle against climate change, seeking to ensure that the interests of island nations, which are particularly threatened, are represented in negotiations over emissions reductions and other measures. In 1995, he helped write what remains a widely used textbook on international environmental law. Sands is now active in the movement to have ecocide — loosely defined as illegal or wanton acts committed in the knowledge that they are very likely to cause severe environmental damage — recognized as an international crime.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War created an opening to finally build on the legacy of Nuremberg, and the Balkan wars and the Rwandan genocide gave added impetus to that work. Pinochet’s arrest in 1998 in London appeared to mark a turning point in the fight for accountability: He was the first former head of state ever detained on foreign soil under the principle of “universal jurisdiction” — the idea that some crimes are so egregious that every nation has a right and a duty to seek to punish those responsible for them.

The British government released Pinochet in 2000, however, citing health concerns, and Sands says that after Sept. 11, the effort to make international criminal law more comprehensive and binding became significantly harder. According to Sands, “38 Londres Street” is in part an “elegy” for the time in the 1990s when the global human rights system seemed to take another step forward.

Still, even as progress slowed, Sands gained recognition for his deep knowledge of the law and for his litigating skills, and his expertise was sought not only by victims of human rights abuses but also by a few notorious oppressors. After Saddam Hussein was deposed and captured in 2003 by U.S.-led coalition forces, intermediaries reached out to see if Sands might be willing to provide legal advice to the Iraqi dictator if he was brought before an international tribunal (Sands wasn’t, and Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death by a special tribunal of Iraqi judges).

A few years later, at the request of the Syrian government, Sands traveled to Damascus to discuss with President Bashar al-Assad the legal jeopardy that he might face as a result of the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon. There was speculation that the Syrian government played a part in his killing, and al-Assad wished to know if he, as a head of state, could claim immunity from potential prosecution. Sands told him he could not. He says that he was offering “an independent opinion” to al-Assad and was never asked to represent him. He adds that upholding international law occasionally requires speaking to the bad guys too.

To Sands, the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib was a shocking betrayal of the values that the United States claimed to represent, and President Obama’s failure to hold those officials accountable remains a source of disappointment to him. Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world. The postwar global order was principally an American creation, and this extended to the advancement of human rights. “The United States was the architect, very largely, of the rules that I have been involved with my whole life,” Sands says. “We saw it as the mansion on the hill, the guardian of the idea of the international rule of law.” But a year into Trump’s second presidency, that no longer seems to be the case. “We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.

In 2010, Sands was invited to give a lecture at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. He had never been to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, but it was where his maternal grandfather, Leon Buchholz, was born and raised. Buchholz, who eventually settled in Paris, rarely spoke of Lviv or of the family that he lost in the Holocaust, a conspicuous silence during Sands’s childhood. After accepting the invitation, Sands decided to research the family history that Buchholz had never shared. In short order, he discovered the tragic fate of Buchholz’s mother and dozens of other relatives, and he learned too that Raphael Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpacht had both attended law school in Lviv. Sands also became acquainted with the sons of two of the men responsible for the deaths of his family members: Niklas Frank, whose father, Hans, administered German-occupied Poland during World War II and who was among the Nazi officials convicted at Nuremberg and executed; and Horst von Wächter, whose father, Otto, was the Nazi official in charge of Galicia, which included Lviv.

Sands told the stories of Hans Frank and Otto von Wächter and of how their sons reckoned with their crimes in a compelling 2015 documentary, “My Nazi Legacy,” which he wrote and narrated. Niklas Frank, who became a journalist, renounced his father and wrote a book harshly condemning him. Horst von Wächter is a more complicated figure. Although he later opened his family’s archives to Sands, he could not bring himself to accept his father’s culpability. The film’s most poignant scene comes when Sands, Frank and von Wächter visit the field not far from Lviv where in 1943 around 3,500 Jews were executed and buried, including some of Sands’s relatives (as well as relatives of Hersh Lauterpacht). Troops under the command of von Wächter’s father took part in the massacre. As Frank and von Wächter stand before a memorial commemorating the atrocity, Frank says, “This our fathers did.” From von Wächter’s stricken look, it seems clear that he knows the truth, but even then, he refuses to admit it.

A year after the documentary was released, Sands published “East West Street.” Part of the book is about the Nuremberg trials and the behind-the-scenes jockeying between Lemkin and Lauterpacht over how the defendants were to be charged. Lemkin wanted them tried for what he called “genocide” — for murdering people because they were members of a particular group, for killing Jews because they were Jews. Lauterpacht didn’t dispute that Jews had been victimized because of their identity, but he pushed to have the defendants charged instead with what he called crimes against humanity — with killing people as individuals. He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose. As Sands writes in “East West Street”: “By focusing on the individual, not the group, Lauterpacht wanted to diminish the force of intergroup conflict. It was a rational, enlightened view, and also an idealistic one.”

Lauterpacht prevailed at Nuremberg: In October 1946, 18 Nazi leaders were convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity, but the judgments against them made no mention of genocide. Lemkin’s lobbying efforts did not go unrewarded, however. Two months after the verdicts in Nuremberg, the United Nations voted to designate genocide an international crime. And in the decades since, largely owing to the enduring resonance of the Holocaust, genocide has come to be regarded as the more consequential and damning accusation — the “crime of crimes,” as Sands puts it. He finds this regrettable; crimes against humanity are no less heinous than acts of genocide, and he believes they should carry just as much opprobrium. But the bigger problem, in his mind, is that because the word “genocide” has such powerful connotations, it is often used carelessly and as a cudgel.

The pitfalls of the genocide charge became apparent to Sands when he represented Croatia in the case that it brought against Serbia in 1999 (another lawyer on the team was Keir Starmer, now Britain’s prime minister). The allegation centered on the massacre in November 1991 of several hundred Croatian P.O.W.s and civilians by Serbian paramilitaries; the killings took place near Vukovar, a city in Croatia. When the I.C.J. finally issued a decision, in 2015 (the wheels of international justice are especially slow to turn), it declined to categorize the slaughter as genocide. The ruling infuriated Croats, and their outrage was compounded by the fact that the same court had earlier affirmed that the 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica, also by Serbian paramilitaries, did meet the definition. (The court ruled that those Serbian units committed genocide but concluded that the Serbian government itself could not be held responsible for the atrocities.)

Sands told me that this remains a source of resentment in Croatia. “Many people believe there will be another war because the Croats didn’t get their genocide. And their anger is against the Bosnians, who got a genocide. So you ask yourself the question: Why is that a socially useful outcome?” He says that Lauterpacht anticipated the danger in elevating genocide to a crime — that it would sharpen tribal instincts and make it more likely, not less, that eliminationist desires would be acted on — and that he has come to share this view. Intellectually, he stands with Lauterpacht.

At the same time, he admits that he is very sympathetic to Lemkin’s position. During a talk at the City University of New York last March, Sands recalled visiting the site near Lviv where his relatives were murdered. “Standing above that unmarked mass grave,” he told the audience, “it was impossible for me as someone who is Jewish not to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the people who were there simply because they were Jews who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.” They were unquestionably the victims of a genocide. So were the Tutsis in Rwanda and the Bosnian Muslims who were massacred in Srebrenica. And despite his frustration with how promiscuously the genocide charge is invoked, Sands is confident that he can make it stick in the case against Myanmar.

More than six years later, Gambia v. Myanmar has now gone to trial at the I.C.J. Under international law, genocide is difficult to prove. Sands and his colleagues must be able to show dolus specialis, or specific intent: They have to establish, through direct evidence or compelling circumstantial evidence, that the only reasonable inference the judges can draw is that the atrocities committed against the Rohingya were motivated wholly or partly by genocidal impulses. On the first day of the hearings, Sands told the court that his side would demonstrate that the violence inflicted on multiple villages by Myanmar’s military met that threshold. Just as in Srebrenica, he said, what occurred in those villages presents “the inescapable conclusion that the crimes against the Rohingya who lived there were perpetrated with genocidal intent.”

One reason the trial in The Hague is being closely watched is the implications that it might have for a case that the I.C.J. is expected to hear later this year: the genocide allegation that South Africa has brought against Israel over the war in Gaza. A determination that Myanmar committed genocide could foretell a similar judgment against Israel. If, on the other hand, the I.C.J. clears Myanmar, it would be interpreted as a positive sign for Israel. Many observers think the court would be reluctant to turn history on its head by making Israel the first nation found guilty of genocide.

What’s more, the judges will be under considerable pressure, because the case against Israel could have onerous consequences for them. The Trump administration has sanctioned a handful of judges and one prosecutor with the International Criminal Court over its 2024 decision to issue arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defense minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and it will undoubtedly seek to punish the I.C.J. if it rules against Israel. (The I.C.C. prosecutes individuals; the I.C.J. adjudicates disputes between countries.)

According to Sands, there is a simple explanation for his reticence: He hasn’t wanted to make any public statements that might prejudice the Myanmar case. What he is willing to say is that he thinks Lemkin would have regarded Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as genocidal, but so too the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack that prompted it. He also points out something else. In 2019, Time magazine published an article about Netanyahu that noted that he was reading “East West Street” and included a photo of him with the book in his hand. Sands’s son (he has three children) had the picture framed. “One thing we can say with certainty,” Sands says, “is that Benjamin Netanyahu is well aware of what Raphael Lemkin considered the crime of genocide and needs no lessons from anyone on the dangers he is likely to face on the basis of his actions.”

But even as he argues another case in The Hague, Sands has come to believe that the law isn’t the only avenue for establishing truth and accountability, or necessarily always the best one. Near the end of his talk in Cambridge, Sands took questions. One student suggested that as a condition for ending the war in Ukraine, Russia was likely to demand that any criminal charges against Vladimir Putin and other officials be dropped. (The recent peace plan endorsed by President Trump included full amnesty for all parties.) How, he asked, would Sands “balance the tension between stopping more violence and seeing justice for violence that has already happened?”

Sands said that in any situation in which a civilian population has been brutalized, the crimes must be acknowledged. “You have to find a way to address what happened,” he said. But he went on to tell the student that his work as a writer had broadened his view of how justice might be achieved. He mentioned, by way of example, the role that literature has played in helping Chile recover from the horrors of the Pinochet era. “It has had a profoundly important impact,” Sands said. He also cited Patrick Radden Keefe’s book “Say Nothing,” about sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/01/magazine/01mag-sands-HP-square/01mag-sands-HP-square-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:58:58.906844

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it’s worth speaking out, and it’s worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump’s actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump’s authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society.

""We're one of the only churches that are having in-person service. Most Latino churches don't have a service because even citizens and legal residents are afraid to come out or to go to the store,"" Pastor Sergio Amezcua said.

Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began Operation Metro Surge in December, Amezcua has been helping families who don't feel safe leaving their homes.

When he first asked his assistant to put out a call on social media, he thought they would receive a few requests.

""That was at 11 a.m. in the morning and by 7 p.m., my assistant called me and said, 'Pastor, a lot of people registered.' I was like, '20 families? 10?' 'No, 2,000,'"" Amezcua recalled.

According to Amezcua, so far they've been able to help approximately 14,000 families, but around 25,000 families are registered.

Right now, they're distributing anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 pounds of food per week with the help of hundreds of volunteers.

""It looks like they're responding to a hurricane catastrophe, but it is a mental catastrophe what the government is doing with us in Minnesota,"" Amezcua said.

DHH Church is helping families from not just the metro area but across the state. They also provide food to 20 churches, 10 schools and a refugee organization.

""Our refugees and our immigrant community... are going through hell and that's not the America... that we know,"" Amezcua said. ""I want to make clear... that from a conservative pastor, what Donald Trump and the White House is doing is horrible. We feel betrayed by him and his White House. That's the way we feel.""

Amezcua recalled getting a phone call from a mother who was reusing single-use diapers, saying, ""She was washing the diapers and I said, 'No, no, no'... I sent a text, if you can donate diapers. Our volunteer force showed up with what you see here.""

On the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, DHH Church was full of volunteers and people dropping off donations. Amezcua said once he realized food banks would be closed for the holiday, he started texting people. The community quickly mobilized. They plan to help 700-1,000 families on Monday alone.

""This is one way that takes no skill. Just takes showing up and I think we gotta keep showing up for stuff,"" said Brian McDermott, a volunteer who also dropped off food donations on Sunday.

Amezcua said with 25,000 families registered, they can't reach everyone. He's hoping to train more churches to do what they're doing.

Federal response to ICE lawsuit

The backstory:

A federal judge has fast-tracked a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul against the federal government over increased ICE activities. The judge denied an immediate halt to the activities, and Attorney General Keith Ellison has since sent a letter to the judge requesting a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order, citing what he said were escalating harms from the federal government’s actions.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud, as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. The lawsuit alleges the enforcement activities are impacting schools and businesses, with local leaders urging federal agents to stop using what they describe as excessive force and start wearing body-worn cameras.

Officials have emphasized the lawsuit is not an attempt to try and block immigration enforcement altogether, but rather to stop what they describe as unlawful federal enforcement.

The other side:

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly criticized the state and Minneapolis leaders, accusing them of protecting criminals in their opposition to ICE.

What's next:

The judge ordered federal officials to submit their response to the lawsuit no later than Monday, Jan. 19. The plaintiffs will then have until Thursday, Jan. 22, to respond to those arguments.

Federal officials have not filed a response as of Monday morning.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.
In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal.","As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon’s legacy.

In the year since Donald Trump’s second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized.

One year ago, Trump’s executive orders, “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” and “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump’s birthday.

The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city’s Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for.

Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon’s plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.

‘We’ve always strived to be a more perfect union’

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump’s comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.

“I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven’t always been perfect, but we’ve always strived to be this more perfect union, and that’s what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland’s first Black governor and only the nation’s third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration’s priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement.

“From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank is encouraging the holiday’s focus to stay solely on King himself. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago.

But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King’s ambition for the country, Hafera argued.

“I think efforts should be conducted in the spirit of what Martin Luther King actually believed and what he preached. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don’t judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.”

Groups call for holiday of reclamation, education and rallying

The NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn’t, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy.

“As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said.

The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, has planned its events under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action.” Organizers planned demonstrations in Atlanta, Chicago and Oakland, California, among other cities, over the weekend and Monday.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

For the first time in its 60-year history, Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King dinner. Over the years, the event drew notable guest speakers including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and activist Angela Davis.

The reasoning was “budget constraints,” according to a social media post by the school’s Black Student Union. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported.

Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. But a member of the church’s “social justice and peace committee” told NewsCenterMaine.com that the pastor was concerned about people’s safety amid rumors of ICE agents being in the area.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. The museum is located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968. The museum is offering free admission on the holiday, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26017756118578.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-19 12:58:04.556951

The latest ICE Out! event drew protesters who outlined specific demands for Richmond and Virginia officials regarding immigration policy.

""We need to shut down all detention centers in Virginia. We need to ensure legal and financial support from the state and from the city for those detained. We must ensure that Richmond does not renegotiate any contract with Flock surveillance cameras or any other surveillance technology,"" one protester said.

Sunday's rally continued the momentum from last weekend's demonstration on Broad Street where around 300 people protested the deadly shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Good by a federal ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Richmond protesters demand justice after Renee Good killed in ICE shooting

Last Saturday's protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend, with demonstrators braving heavy rain as they assembled underneath the Maggie Walker statue to express frustration over Good's shooting.

""This is what that actually looks like, coming together for something good instead of violence and domination and terror,"" Te'Shaun Cleckley, one of last weekend's demonstrators, said.

Good, an Old Dominion University graduate and mother of three, was shot three times by the federal agent in an encounter captured on multiple cellphone videos that have sparked nationwide scrutiny.

The Trump Administration has defended the agent's actions, with President Trump stating Friday: ""We will always be protecting ICE and we will always be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.""

Cleckley urged fellow protesters to continue fighting for justice in Good's memory.

""Our mobilization to fight for justice and for liberation and for dignity and equity for everybody, isn't necessarily rooted in the reality that we're going to win,"" Cleckley said. ""It's rooted in the fact that we love the world around us, we love the people around us and we love the people that are gonna come after us. So my message would be, don't stop.""

Spanberger's policy reversal marks a sharp departure from Youngkin's approach, which included consistent support for ICE operations.

As a result, within the Fifth Circuit, providers cannot rely on the No Surprises Act (NSA) itself to enforce Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) awards in court and face a heightened standing bar for ERISA-based claims where patients are insulated from financial harm. And the persuasive effect of the Fifth Circuit’s holding is bolstered nationwide.

Background

As we explained previously, Guardian Flight arose out of efforts by air ambulance providers Guardian Flight and Med-Trans to collect payments awarded through the IDR process under the NSA. After prevailing in multiple “baseball-style” IDR proceedings against an insurer, the providers alleged that the insurer failed to pay the awards within the 30‑day deadline required by the NSA. They sued to enforce those awards, asserting: (1) direct claims under the NSA; (2) derivative ERISA claims based on assignments from plan beneficiaries; and (3) a Texas quantum meruit claim. The district court dismissed across the board, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the NSA does not create a private right of action for providers to enforce IDR awards, that the providers lacked ERISA standing because NSA‑protected beneficiaries suffered no concrete financial injury, and that the quasi‑contract claim failed because the services were rendered for the patients, not for the insurer.

Issues Presented in the Cert Petition

The certiorari petition asked the Supreme Court to review two issues with potentially far‑reaching consequences for NSA and ERISA litigation. First, it asked whether a breach of ERISA plan terms is itself an injury in fact to a plan beneficiary even where the beneficiary is insulated from out‑of‑pocket harm by the NSA’s balance‑billing protections, and therefore whether assignee‑providers can rely on that breach alone to establish Article III standing. Second, it asked whether, when Congress made NSA IDR awards “binding” and directed that insurers “shall” pay them within 30 days, it intended to permit providers to sue in court to enforce those awards, rather than leaving enforcement exclusively to administrative agencies. The petition argued that the Fifth Circuit’s answers to both questions deepen existing splits among the circuits on what constitutes a concrete injury under Spokeo and Ramirez, and on how to read statutory “binding” and “shall pay” language in the private-right-of-action context.

Practical Impact in the Fifth Circuit

With the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari, the Fifth Circuit’s analysis now firmly governs within Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and will be influential elsewhere. In practical terms, providers in the Fifth Circuit cannot bring standalone NSA claims to compel payment of IDR awards, and must instead look primarily to federal and state regulators (such as Health and Human Services) or to contract‑based remedies to address nonpayment. ERISA‑based claims will continue to face heightened standing scrutiny where patients are shielded from financial liability, as the Fifth Circuit treats the plan’s alleged failure to pay as a “technical” breach insufficient, by itself, to constitute a concrete injury to the beneficiary. And state‑law quasi‑contract theories remain constrained by the court’s view that services performed for patients do not satisfy Texas’s requirement that services be rendered for the defendant’s benefit.

Numerous other district courts throughout the United States have followed the Fifth Circuit’s lead in finding providers lack a private right of action to enforce IDR awards, and we expect the denial of certiorari will add further support for district courts considering the issue in the future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14355_0412.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:58:25.579400

Martin Luther King Jr., communities in the Bay Area will celebrate the legendary civil rights activist’s legacy by making their voices heard, amid the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and deport historic numbers of immigrants.

“This year is not just about honoring history, it’s about practicing for the future,” said Gina Fromer, CEO of San Francisco social justice organization GLIDE. “I have no doubt that we need to march many times this year in defense of our rights. Dr. King said hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

Fromer said GLIDE’s annual march, which gathers at the San Francisco Caltrain station at Fourth and King Streets and has been a local tradition for 41 years, is intended to mirror the Selma to Montgomery protest marches of 1965.

Across the Bay Area, activists are seizing the moment and transforming what is typically a yearly opportunity to give back through acts of service into a day of political action. Throughout the Bay Area, residents are honoring MLK’s desire to strengthen community and building local resilience through shoreline cleanups, food distributions and interfaith gatherings.

This year, Fromer said, Glide’s march will advocate for “radical inclusivity” at a time when the rights of LGBTQ+, unhoused and immigrant communities are threatened. She noted that the current administration’s attacks make the late leader’s message of “unconditional love” more important than ever.

In the East Bay, the Freedmen Federation and Faith In Action East Bay have organized a Unity Vigil at Richmond’s City Hall to address what they call “state-sanctioned violence.”

Kira Lee, a professor and organizer with the collective, said the recent death of Los Angeles resident and U.S. citizen Keith Porter Jr. in ICE custody and sightings of federal immigration agents in Richmond have made it impossible to separate the holiday from the current political moment.

Lee called the surge in enforcement an “exercise in othering” that targets residents across race and citizenship status. “I don’t view this as an immigration issue. I view this as a racial issue,” Lee said.

“I view it as slave catching, where state violence is being used to decide who belongs and who doesn’t. Black and brown families have been screaming for protection this entire time.”

In the tradition of giving back, South Berkeley high school students with the youth design nonprofit Girls Garage will unveil their renovation of a home for an older Black couple this weekend.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday will mark the culmination of a year-long project to repair damage done by an unlicensed contractor that had left the family home unlivable and them at risk of displacement.

Emily Pilloton-Lam, the nonprofit’s founder, said that community-led projects offer people realistic ways to take action during periods of national uncertainty. And encouraging young women and gender-expansive youth to lead the remodel, she said, sends a powerful message.

“It is a very, very difficult time to maintain hope when we see what’s going on all over the country,” Pilloton-Lam said. “Projects like this bring us back down to a really human scale of one family, one neighbor and local organizations. It’s a reminder that we still can make a really big difference in the lives of individuals in our immediate community.”

While President Donald Trump scrapped free entry to National Parks on MLK Day, adding his own birthday to the calendar, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Friday that visitors can enjoy free entry at more than 200 of California’s state parks for MLK Day.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:11.862244

“Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting?","Advances Election Integrity Investigation with Legal Action

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to compel the release of public records showing whether, and to what extent, it is guarding against voting by illegal aliens. The suit, filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on January 16, stems from the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles’ (DC DMV) failure to respond to FAIR’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted on November 12, 2025.

This legal action is a direct follow-up to FAIR’s ongoing investigation, launched in November 2025, into jurisdictions with policies that pose a high risk of facilitating voting by illegal aliens. To date, the investigation has focused on states like California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington—all of which engage in automatic voter registration, universal mail-in voting, and the issuance of driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. FAIR’s investigation seeks to determine whether adequate measures are in place in these jurisdictions to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote, and to ensure compliance with federal laws like the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the REAL ID Act.

FAIR’s FOIA request to the DC DMV specifically sought records, policies, and communications detailing how the agency distinguishes between U.S. citizens and noncitizens during voter registration processes, verifies citizenship status before transmitting data to election officials, and handles data from non-REAL ID-compliant credential holders. Since FAIR submitted its request in early November 2025, the DC DMV has provided no substantive response, determination, or records—an egregious violation of DC FOIA’s mandatory timelines.

“American citizens deserve confidence that their elections are secure and free from interference by those who are not eligible to vote,” said Dale Wilcox, FAIR’s Executive Director and General Counsel. “The District of Columbia’s refusal to provide these basic records raises serious questions about whether safeguards exist to protect election integrity. FAIR is committed to holding governments accountable and ensuring transparency in how voter rolls are managed, especially in jurisdictions with policies that invite abuse.”

“The DC DMV’s stonewalling is unacceptable and undermines public trust in our democratic processes,” added Mateo Forero, FAIR’s Director of Investigations and counsel of record in the case. “Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting? By forcing the release of these documents through litigation, we aim to expose any vulnerabilities and push for reforms that prioritize lawful participation in elections.”

The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years is being tested as it has never been in modern times,” according to videos that circulated online.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

Undeterred, Mr. Springsteen released a six-track EP that offered a mix of songs and his political remarks from the show in England.

Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney.","An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, on Jan. 7 when she attempted to drive away as agents tried to get her out of her vehicle. Two days later during a vehicle stop in Portland, Oregon, a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded two Venezuelans. One of them, Luis David Nino-Moncada, recently pleaded not guilty of aggravated assault against a federal officer and damaging federal property.

Soon after, protests erupted across the country in both blue states such as California and New York and red states like Texas — which saw large demonstrations in Houston, Austin, Dallas and other cities.

Trump, who made mass deportations a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, reiterated his administration's commitment to the policy in a press release on Wednesday, linking higher deportations to lower housing costs, higher wages and lower crime.

During his second term, Trump has shifted the government's focus from border enforcement to arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants from the nation's interior. Daily ICE arrests in Texas have jumped from an average of 85 per day during the final 18 months of the Biden Administration to 176 per day in the first six months under Trump, according to a Tribune analysis.

Undocumented immigrants in Texas have reported staying home as much as possible to avoid being targeted by immigration officers or police.

Meanwhile, ICE facilities in Texas and elsewhere have been targeted: In September, a 29-year-old man fired on an immigration enforcement office in Dallas, killing two detainees and wounding another. Just a few months earlier, a group of nearly a dozen people attacked a detention center in Alvaro with tactical gear and weapons, injuring a local law enforcement officer.

Here's what to know about how ICE is operating in Texas and what rights people have when approached by an agent.

How is ICE arresting people in Texas?

The most high-profile operations are street raids, where ICE agents, often accompanied by state troopers and local police, target a particular area or business and arrest groups of undocumented immigrants.

Some of the biggest raids have taken place in and around Houston: In May, ICE said it deported more than 500 people and arrested more than 400 suspected undocumented immigrants in and around the city in roughly one week. In October, ICE carried out another massive operation in Houston over the course of 10 days, in which they said they arrested more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.

ICE has focused mainly on the state's large urban areas, but earlier this year, according to Border Report, the head of the South Texas Builders Association said agents have been raiding construction sites along the border.

But the most common way ICE agents track down undocumented immigrants is through the local criminal justice system. Immigration agents can request that jails hold an undocumented person who has been jailed, then turn them over to ICE for deportation. The Harris County Jail leads the country for such immigration holds, also known as ICE detainers, according to a Tribune analysis.

ICE is also increasingly targeting immigrants when they arrive for court hearings or routine immigration appointments; ICE agents have arrested people at federal buildings in El Paso, immigration courts in San Antonio and probation offices in Dallas.

How and why does ICE work with local police departments?

Early in Trump's second administration, Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to support federal immigration enforcement operations in tracking down and deporting undocumented immigrants.

Some sheriffs in Texas have signed agreements to work closely with ICE to enforce immigration laws. A new state law passed in last year's legislative session requires sheriffs in all counties with a jail to enter into such agreements, also known as the 287(g) program, this year. Since Trump returned to the White House, more than half of ICE arrests in Texas have come from local jails, according to the Tribune analysis.

Even in Democrat-run Texas cities like Austin and San Antonio, where local leaders in the past have stated their police won't cooperate with immigration officers, the state requires local police departments to support ICE operations — a policy adopted by other states like Florida and Louisiana.

According to KUT, the Austin Police Department on Thursday announced that officers have ""general orders"" to work alongside federal immigration officers to execute immigration warrants. In March, Houston police were instructed to call federal immigration authorities if they come across a person who has deportation orders in the national crime database.

Are any places off limits to ICE agents?

The Trump administration, early in his second term, rescinded federal policies that limited arrests of immigrants in sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals.

But to enter private spaces such as homes and businesses, immigration agents and police still need a warrant signed by a judge to enter.

If ICE agents approach you in public, what are your rights?

Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney. If an agent doesn't have a signed warrant, people have the right to refuse them entry into their home and the right to refuse searches, regardless of their citizenship status. Agents have the right to pat a person down to check for weapons.

The American Civil Liberties Union advises people to stay calm and not resist or obstruct the agents. They also advise people not to lie to agents or give them fake documents.

They recommend that people memorize phone numbers of their family members and friends, and their lawyer. If they take medication, have a plan for another person to give those medications to agents if they are arrested.",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19082548/0401-ICE-Raid-Minor-EG-26-1500x1001.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:12.088434

President

Arab American Institute

How did we get to the point where the president can say and do things that put our culture and democracy at risk, and it’s just shrugged off as if it were normal?

In social media posts and unscripted press comments he uses language that would have been unimaginable coming from a president in any other period of American history. In just the past few months, Mr. Trump: was photographed making an obscene gesture and mouthing a vulgarity at a demonstrator; demeaned a popular TV personality who had just been murdered; called a Somali American member of Congress garbage, adding that all Somalis were garbage; called the Governor of Minnesota “retarded,” an especially hurtful slur as that governor has a son with a disability; and insulted women reporters who asked him challenging questions, calling them “ugly,” “obnoxious,” and “stupid.”

Parents wouldn’t tolerate this from their children and yet here we have a president of the United States demeaning his office by speaking in such a deplorable manner.

It’s not just the president’s speech that has been so “unpresidential.” Mr. Trump’s need to gratify his ego has led him to make exaggerated false claims about his grievances and his successes. He claims that he has been attacked by media, Congress, and law enforcement agencies like no other president in history. At the same time, he boasts that he has improved the economy and made our cities safer than they have ever been. None of this is true.

In an effort to impose his will and worldview, he has surrounded himself with White House staff and Cabinet that not only heap praise upon him and carry out his every whim, but also support his efforts to silence and intimidate those whom he has denounced as critics.

Herein lies a fundamental difference between President Trump’s first and second terms. In the former, some senior members of his staff and Cabinet served as a check on his behavior. Many were fired and replaced. He began his second term with a detailed plan to transform government, and with a more compliant senior leadership (e.g., the Department of Justice and FBI are willing to order investigations of his critics).

This combination of unchecked power, the president’s need to have his every ambition fulfilled, and his disrespect for law and precedent has led to actions that are illegal. In the first few months, his administration put in place a program to remove over 300,000 government employees. He shuttered USAID, the Voice of America, and the US Institute for Peace—all illegal actions as these were congressionally created and funded entities. He later reopened the Institute for Peace as the Trump Institute for Peace; renamed the nation’s premier center for the arts The Donald J Trump, The John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts without any authorization; and had the White House’s East Wing torn down to be replaced by another vanity project—a massive ballroom—which no doubt will also bear his name in the near future.

Conceivably the most dangerous of President Trump’s moves have been the dramatic expansion of ICE—the immigration enforcement entity—and its unleashing in US cities, posing a direct threat to American democracy.

In recent weeks Mr. Trump sent a massive contingent of ICE agents to Minneapolis, Minnesota ostensibly to root out illegal immigrants, while attempting to embarrass that state’s Democratic governor and to target one of Mr. Trump’s new favorites, Minnesota’s large Somali community. As expected, ICE’s arrests have been indiscriminate, detaining many legal residents and citizens, and their behavior unacceptably brutal. As seen in other cities, ICE behaviors have provoked widespread protests. In one horrifying incident, a member of an observer team monitoring ICE behavior was shot and killed through an open car window by an ICE agent.

The shooting was filmed from multiple angles, establishing that the victim posed no threat to the ICE agent. That didn’t stop the president and other administration officials from propagating a lie about what had transpired. They called the murdered woman a domestic terrorist, saying she’d threatened the life of the ICE shooter. Unwrapping this murder is instructive on many levels.

First, with the enormous budget appropriated for ICE expansion, that entity now has over 10,000 armed agents. The rapidity of its growth has led to inadequate vetting and training. More dangerous still is how ICE has recruited agents: at gun shows and right-wing events, and targeted advertisements on right-wing radio shows. The White House appears to be forming an ideologically cohesive national police force that is anti-immigrant and violence-prone and has been told by the administration that they can act with impunity.

This incident also points out the extent to which the White House is capable of fabricating a storyline that will be echoed by other leaders and their supportive media outlets. The impact is clear. A recent poll showed that, by a wide margin, most Americans believe that the woman’s killing was wrong, but more than three-quarters of Republicans believe the president’s narrative that the murdered woman was a threat to the ICE agent and her killing was justified.

So, how did we get to this point? The answer is clear. A president who says whatever he needs to say to justify his position, officials around him and a supportive media who vociferously agree with him and threaten those who disagree, and a cult-like movement of partisans who will believe what they are told even when the facts speak to a different reality.

… [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.” The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced.
Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman.
In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents.
Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.","It was more than five years ago, but Democrats are still hurting from self-inflicted wounds caused by the slogan “Defund the Police.”

The right-wing media’s echo chamber keeps bellowing those words with delight. They aim to make all Democrats look like they foolishly want to open the door to criminals. Now, Trump-approved media has a new siren call: “Abolish ICE.” They want any whisper of those words to become a weight to sink Democratic candidates and blunt what is widely forecast to be a blue wave in November.

Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington, is warning about the political trap being set for Democrats: “The impulse is emotional. The slogan is simple. But politically, it is lethal,” cautions a recent memo. “Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want. … [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.”

The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced. And they can be enforced in ways that protect public safety…[voters] understand this. They responded strongly to what they saw as a lack of enforcement under President Biden. But they are also recoiling from Trump’s excessive force.”

Slogans aside, there are legitimate calls for Americans to take bold action. Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman. At the White House, the press secretary publicly asked a reporter why Good died. “Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably,” came the reply.

Under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE has undergone massive expansion — with funding now rivaling or exceeding that of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, making it one of the most heavily funded federal law enforcement forces in the country.

How did an immigration enforcement unit become the largest police force in the U.S.? The sad answer is that President Trump is using ICE’s growing presence in America’s cities to normalize the presence of armed federal agents on any street corner. Last week, he threatened to use the Insurrection Act to supplement ICE’s threatening presence with the U.S. military.

The president’s goal is to scare people into silence to halt rising dissent.

In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents. Local officials are plainly saying that these agents are making communities less safe.

What can congressional Democrats do about it?

Here is a to-do list.

First, impose congressional oversight.

Second, call Noem to the hearings and enlist Republicans to consider impeaching her if she does not reduce the budget and the size of this paramilitary force.

Third, call Vice President JD Vance to public hearings. Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.

Vance has a law degree and knows better. This is not a matter of “qualified immunity.” That doctrine protects state and local police from civil lawsuits for errors made as they properly protect the public.

Even with “qualified immunity,” it is important to codify its ICE limits and clear the way to apply accountability for egregious abuse of the public trust by armed agents of a democratic government.

The second Trump administration is barely a year old. He is ignoring legal limitations by unilaterally deciding to send the U.S. military into Venezuela to grab the country’s leader. Even before that act, he defied Congress by using U.S. military missile strikes to kill Venezuelan boat passengers he claimed were drug traffickers. That was way beyond appropriate action, including arrests and boat seizure, normally taken by the coast guard and customs officials.

Don’t forget that Trump’s officials have yet to offer evidence that the people on those bombed boats were drug dealers.

Now this imperious use of force by a president’s administration has come to the homeland, and an American woman lies dead at the hands of ICE.

This cannot go unanswered by Democrats in Congress.

They are in the minority in both the House and Senate. But Democrats have to reach for leverage, including using the threat of a government shutdown to express their outrage at the bloodshed in Minnesota.

Democrats will have a leverage point in two weeks, when the government runs out of funding.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was right to allow an end to last year’s budget shutdown and to let Republicans hang themselves by ending ObamaCare subsidies that gave health care to millions.

A shutdown is still a dubious idea. But murder by a federal agent demands a response.

As we approach the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States this year, the words of our second president, John Adams, ing with renewed urgency:

“Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Trump recently said the only limit on his power is “my morality.” Is that the explanation for his administration’s refusal to hold to the Constitution?

George Conway, the conservative lawyer now running for Congress in New York as a Democrat, put it bluntly: “The President of the United States is a criminal… He has no loyalty to the law or to the Constitution.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26016127809169.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:07.178946

But the killing of Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, as well as the regular, often violent confrontations that ICE stages on US streets, show so much that is unravelling in plain sight. The rule of law, the freedom to protest, and even the right to walk or drive in the streets safely without being assaulted by the state, seems to exist no longer in the towns and cities where ICE has made its presence felt. The most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly it has happened. But for a government agency such as ICE to become the powerful paramilitary force that it is, several factors need to be in play first. Only one of them is Donald Trump.

ICE may look as if it came out of nowhere, but the sort of authoritarianism that results in these crackdowns never does. It takes shape slowly, in plain sight, in a way that is clearly traceable over time. First, there needs to be a merging of immigration and security concerns, both institutionally and in the political culture. Established in the wake of 9/11, ICE was part of a government restructuring under President George W Bush. It was granted a large budget, wide investigative powers and a partnership with the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforce. The work of enforcing immigration law became inextricably linked to the business of keeping Americans safe after the largest attack on US soil. That then extended into a wider emphasis, under Barack Obama, beyond those who posed national security threats, and on to immigrants apprehended at the border, gang members and non-citizens convicted of felonies or misdemeanours.

The dragnet became wider, the budgets became bigger, and due process started to wither. Trump then grew ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with a budget surpassing most of the world’s militaries. And he imbued the agency with a supreme mandate of saving the US from existential threat, a sort of praetorian guard vested with his executive power.

To get where the US is today, you also need an unhinged rightwing media to do the work of scaremongering and priming the public, relentlessly banging the drum on illegal immigration and the threat of demographic overwhelm. And, relatedly, of course, the US immigration crackdowns are sustained by a culture of plain old racism. One that hides behind concerns for public safety, but is in fact a way to channel discontent about the reality of a country that is far less white than many would like.

Next up is a long history and engrained culture of military supremacy. The scenes of ICE officers entering neighbourhoods, heavily armed, looked almost indistinguishable from scenes of US soldiers abroad. So much of the mythology of the American soldier, who has infinite mandate to use violence overseas in defence of freedom and American values, can be seen in the propaganda around ICE. The merging of military and policing functions can be seen in the absurd arsenals of domestic police forces, with their drones, weapons, explosives, armoured personnel carriers and masked faces. And it can be seen in the personnel who move between overseas and domestic forces. The New York Times has reported that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good, served in Iraq.

I have been thinking about what it was about the ICE phenomenon that felt chillingly familiar to someone who grew up under repressive regimes. It wasn’t the deployment of huge numbers of forces, nor was it even the violence. It was the sense that anything could happen to anyone, not just those expressly identified as the legitimate targets of crackdown. The abiding experience of living with authoritarianism is the sense not of imminent assault, but of the constant possibility that suddenly, you could be in trouble. At a traffic incident where the officer didn’t like your tone, at a gathering that was deemed to violate a curfew and then forcibly dismantled, or even on social media where a mindless post could affect your ability to leave the country. It is a state of effacement of all civil rights, and a swelling of government into a volatile, capricious overlord, as safe or scary as the single enforcer in front of you who happens to be vested with its power.

The US has passed through that veil. But there are warning signs in the UK. The relentless portrayal of immigrants as a threat to safety and social cohesion. The same glamorisation of the imagery of crackdown, now a feature of government propaganda as ministers attend Home Office immigration raids. The same expansion of powers and discretion to the police to include ever wider definitions of what a public order infraction is, such as factoring in the “cumulative impact” of pro-Palestine rallies. The transformation of protest into dissidence. The empowerment of the UK Border Force, which now has the right to seize someone’s mobile phone even when they are not under arrest.

A group of protesters interrupted Sunday morning services at a St. Paul church because one of the pastors works with a federal immigration agency, according to police.

At approximately 10:40 a.m., officers were called to the Cities Church in the 1500 block of Summit Avenue after receiving reports that some 30 to 40 protesters had interrupted services, according to police spokesperson Nikki Muehlhausen.

By the time officers arrived, the group had left and was walking down the alley, she said.

In a Facebook post, protesters said they went to the church to ask for justice for Renee Good because they had identified a church pastor as the acting director for the St. Paul field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The church’s website lists David Easterwood as a pastor. Easterwood is listed as a defendant in a Jan. 12 lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota to halt the federal immigration crackdown that led to the fatal Jan. 7 confrontation between Good and an ICE agent. He also defended ICE tactics in an earlier filing on Jan. 5.

DOJ investigation

Later Sunday, Trump administration officials condemned the protest at the St. Paul church, which is is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, a conservative Protestant denomination headquartered in Nashville, Tenn.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it is investigating. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents’ actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

“When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,” said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.”

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood’s personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

Easterwood’s earlier statements

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents “knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.”

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. “They’re going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.”

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ’s prosecution was misguided.

“If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?” Cullars-Doty said. “We can’t sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.”",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STP-L-CHURCH-0119.jpg?w=1024&h=567,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:15.838709

Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.
The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.
Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics.
Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:29.056374

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday night, Blanche said the civil rights unit of the Justice Department would not bow to pressure to investigate the shooting death of Minneapolis resident and mother Good, 37, earlier this month.

“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody,” said Blanche. “We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate.”

“So, no, we are not investigating. And if there comes a time when we need to, we will, but it’s not now,” Blanche added.

Increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers have erupted in Minneapolis since Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot behind the wheel of her car while protesting by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7.

Blanche also said that footage of Good’s death has already “been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones when it happened”.

However, analysis conducted by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and APM Reports found that there still remain questions about the shooting, including why it allegedly took more than 10 minutes after Good was shot before she was given CPR.

According to the MPR and APM reports, ICE agents left Good “bleeding and alone in the car for almost three minutes” and “turned away a man identifying himself as a physician who offered to help”.

The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good up to four times, was acting in self-defence.

Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and White House adviser Stephen Miller, have also said that ICE officers have “absolute immunity” for their immigration enforcement actions.

Meanwhile, lawyers representing Good’s family said last week that they have launched their own “civil investigation” into her death.

“People in Minneapolis and across this country truly, truly care about what happened to Renee Good on January 7, 2026, and are committed to understanding how she could have been killed on the street after dropping her child off at school,” lawyer Antonio Romanucci said in a statement.

Top Minnesota Democrats under investigation

Blanche also separately confirmed reports that the DOJ has launched an investigation into Minnesota Governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz as well as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, alleging the two Democratic leaders were “encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE”.

Blanche’s comments are the first time a member of the Trump administration has confirmed media reports that Walz and Frey are under investigation.

“No matter who you are, whether you’re a governor, a mayor or somebody out there on the streets assaulting ice, you cannot, under federal law, you cannot impede a federal officer doing their job, and that’s what we’re looking at,” said Blanche.

Responding to earlier media reports that the DOJ had launched its probe, Frey said he would “not be intimidated”.

“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey said in a post on X.

Walz, meanwhile, responded to the reports indirectly, saying in a statement: “Weaponising the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ap_696da9a40bdaa-1768794532.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:35.484365

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic.","Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan is about twenty paces wide, curb to curb. Front Street, the main business street in Nome, Alaska, about four thousand air miles to the northwest, is two paces narrower but feels just as wide. Usually, there aren’t a lot of cars or pedestrians on Front Street, and the buildings that line it, none of them tall, seem to lean back from it. More dust and sand and rain and snow blow down Front Street than vehicles drive on it. Standing in line in the cheery post office on West Front, Nome-ites talk and laugh and exchange news. On days when the sand is blowing, some have goggles hanging from their necks or pushed up on their foreheads.

Nome’s sand contains gold, and other minerals. The iron in it will turn white cars a dingy yellow over time. During drier periods, small sand ripples form in corners along the streets, like sand on the bottom of a lake. Since the discovery of gold here, in 1898, billions of dollars have been taken out of Nome’s beach and from the bottom of the Bering Sea, just offshore. With gold at more than four thousand dollars an ounce, the gold dredges move constantly back and forth on the water on calm days in early fall. Ungainly with their beams and pipes, the dredges look like tufts of Rust Belt infrastructure that have blown loose and drifted westward and finally tumbled onto this distant sea. Rainy days turn the sand and dust on Nome’s streets into a thin grayish silt. This is what a place looks like when its streets are paved with gold.

The city of thirty-seven hundred residents is almost as far west as you can go in North America. Front Street parallels the sea, whose storms and giant blocks of ice have sometimes beaten the business district flat. Gold’s current valuation is just one of many international factors to keep in mind here. The Russia-U.S. border, which follows the International Date Line, is less than a hundred and fifty miles away. Provideniya, a Russian town with a formerly large military base, is two hundred and thirty miles from Nome. Cruise ships from Europe that have travelled the Northeast Passage route over the top of the planet stop in Nome, as do ships that have followed the Northwest Passage across northernmost North America.

Along the Alaskan coastline, it’s about a hundred and ten miles from Nome to Wales, the continent’s westernmost point. From Wales, it’s twenty-five miles to the Russian island of Big Diomede, and fifty-two miles to the coast of Chukotka, as that easternmost district of Russia is called.

Starting in 1999, I used to come to Nome to do research on a book I was writing about Siberia. I wanted to go from Nome to Russia, a goal that involved complications and extra trips on this side. One morning, in a Nome café called Fat Freddie’s, I met Jim Stimpfle, Nome’s most famous citizen, a man of grand ideas. The card he gave me listed him as a director of the Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel & Railroad Group, whose intention was to dig a tunnel from near Wales to the “Chukotka Nose,” the very tip of Russia and of Asia, and to build a railroad that would go up the coast of North America, pass through the tunnel (“Just forty-one miles longer than the Chunnel!” Stimpfle said), and connect to another yet-to-be-constructed railroad, in Russia.

Stimpfle became famous in this way: His father was a dentist in Washington, D.C., with patients and friends in the diplomatic corps. Stimpfle wanted to be a diplomat himself, but after he graduated from George Mason University, in 1970, he ended up in Alaska, where eventually he married a Native woman, Yaayuk Bernadette Alvanna, whose family came from King Island, which is off the coast north of Nome. He became a real-estate agent; he says he has been inside almost every building in Nome. Through his wife, he learned that Natives on this side—the Yupik and the Inupiat—remembered relatives on the Russian side whom they hadn’t seen since J. Edgar Hoover and the Soviet government shut down cross-border travel and communication, in 1948, creating what became known as the Ice Curtain.

In the nineteen-eighties, Stimpfle decided to devote his spare time and energies to breaching that curtain, reëstablishing Russian-American connections, and reuniting Native relatives. By September, 1987, his efforts to restart travel back and forth had got the attention of Alaska Airlines and Exploration Cruise Lines. The Wall Street Journal did a front-page article about this lesser-known border, and quoted Stimpfle. After that piece, more reporters wrote about him. They said that Jim Stimpfle, a local real-estate agent and a private citizen in Nome, was working to end the Cold War.

At the Alaska Aviation Museum, near the airport in Anchorage, a Boeing 737 with the logo of Alaska Airlines on its sides and the company’s emblem of a smiling, parka-wearing Native man on its tail sits with other mothballed airplanes outside a hangar. A plaque beside it reads “Historic Flights to Russian Far East: Friendship Flight, Nome-Provideniya; June 13, 1988.” On that day, Stimpfle and seventy-nine other officials, reporters, and ordinary Alaskans, including thirty Native people, flew in this plane for an inaugural visit.

Photos of the delegation show Stimpfle on board among other smiling folks leaning over the seat backs and talking and standing in the aisle. He had coined the term “Friendship Flight,” and as the president of the Nome Chamber of Commerce had been agitating for the idea tirelessly. Mead Treadwell, at the time a young Yale graduate who had already been involved in Alaskan politics for a decade, remembers Frank Murkowski, then a U.S. senator, saying to him, “Mead, I’ve been getting Stimpfle’s faxes every day for a year and a half.” Murkowski was just one of dozens of officials whom Stimpfle besieged.

After the Friendship Flight took off from Nome, it flew for about forty-five minutes and landed on the gravel runway at Provideniya’s airport. The cabin door opened, uniformed Russian officialdom entered, and a pattern began that would be repeated many times—the checking of documents, the standing in line, the triple-thump of passport stamping, the boarding onto not-new buses, the arrival at a dim official hall, the salty snacks, the sit-down banquets, the ryumki (shot glasses) standing in rows, the toasts being raised bezkonechno (without end), the mutual incomprehension, the unmoored good cheer.

I went up the boarding stairs to the plane and stepped into its open door. The passenger seats had been removed and benches installed along the walls. When you’re an airline passenger, knee to spine with your neighbors, you forget that what you’re in is just a big tube. The almost empty piece of aluminum echoed and creaked.

Stimpfle still lives in Nome and is still its most famous citizen. I went there in September, and he was the first person I called. Fat Freddie’s has closed, and Stimpfle now patronizes the Polar Cub Café, where he sits with friends at the same table almost every morning. Just beyond the café’s broad windows, the waves of the Bering Sea batter the granite riprap frontage. One morning, Stimpfle joined me at a corner table. I’d last seen him twenty-four years ago, an interval that has slowed us both. He wore a brown knit cap with a bill, a zippered jacket, loose knee-length blue shorts over gray sweatpants, and black running shoes. He is tall and strong-looking, and his blue eyes, which used to spark behind his spectacles and sharp nose, have grown mellow.

Looking across the expanse of sea, he talked about his first attempts to contact somebody—anybody—on the Russian side. He began by filling balloons with air or with exhaust from his car and writing messages on the balloons themselves. Then, on a strong east wind one day, he released a weather balloon that he had filled with helium. Attached was a capsule containing small gifts—tobacco, sugar, tea, and sewing supplies—and a message of friendship which a schoolteacher in Nome had translated into Russian. Stimpfle watched the balloon rise and move offshore. Then the balloon began to descend, landed on the sea, and bounced along the surface. A seal hunter who happened to be passing by saw it and took it into his boat. He opened the capsule, saw the notes in Cyrillic, and thought the balloon must have come from Russia.

By following the boat along the coast, Stimpfle tracked down the hunter, Tim Gologergen, and explained about the balloon. Soon afterward, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research ship, the Surveyor, docked in Nome. Its captain had received an invitation from the mayor of Provideniya, Oleg Kulinkin, to bring his ship to its harbor for a brief visit—something that had not happened in sixty years. Stimpfle gave the Surveyor’s captain a message to pass to Kulinkin. The captain did, and when the ship returned to Nome he brought a message from Kulinkin to Stimpfle. That was the first success Stimpfle had in reaching someone across the strait. When the Friendship Flight went to Provideniya, a year later, he met the mayor in person. Tim Gologergen was on the flight, too, and found relatives in town, to whom he spoke in Yupik.

Stimpfle added, “I heard that Kulinkin was later murdered by the Russian mafia in the Russian Far East city of Magadan, in a hotel where I had stayed myself.”

In 1991, Alaska Airlines began regular service to Magadan and Khabarovsk, a city well into Russia, on the Amur River. For a while, the Russian Far East seemed like an extension of North America’s West Coast. Aeroflot began to fly into Seattle and Anchorage. Once, in the mid-nineties, in the Seattle airport, when I was on my way from Montana to Los Angeles, I talked to a man from Orlando, Florida, who said he worked for a Saudi-owned oil company at a site on Sakhalin Island where he oversaw an operation involving supertankers and pipelines and underwater infrastructure maintained by teams of scuba divers, who also brought up delicious crabs that he ate. He said the fishing there was excellent, even right offshore. He then got in line for his Aeroflot flight to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, boarding on the same concourse as my flight to L.A.

Trans-strait connections multiplied. In the fall of 1988, a pod of gray whales became stranded in an iced-in pocket of the Beaufort Sea, off the city of Barrow, on Alaska’s North Slope, and a Soviet icebreaker arrived and opened the obstructed water and apparently freed them—they were seen no more. Between March and May, 1989, a combined expedition of Russian and U.S. sled-dog teams trekked from the city of Anadyr, in Chukotka, to the city of Kotzebue, on the Baldwin Peninsula, with an airlift from Nome for the last stretch. An Inuit Quaker evangelist named Robert Sheldon led a five-man Native expedition going in the other direction, from Alaska to Chukotka, by snowmobile. They needed a helicopter lift over the strait, which by then was no longer freezing all the way.

Provideniya and Nome agreed to declare themselves each other’s sister city. Bering Air, a prop-plane airline started in Nome by a couple from Michigan, began flights to Provideniya and Anadyr. Direct phone service was established; previously, calls from one side to the other had to go all the way around the world, via Moscow. A group of Soviet Young Pioneers visited the Nome Boy Scouts. Stores in Nome put up signs in Cyrillic and began to accept rubles from Russian tourists, who had started to come. Later, the stores were stuck with the rubles when the Russian government would not exchange them for dollars or let them be brought back into the country. The stores made gift packets of rubles and sold them as souvenirs.

A charitable group flew a Russian burn victim across the border for care in the U.S. Dancers from Provideniya performed in Nome, and there was a game between the cities’ youth basketball teams. The local paper, the Nome Nugget, reported that, with the border open, three Nome-ites had found spouses from Provideniya. The story said that the Alaskan men liked how the Russian women dressed, in skirts and high heels at ten below zero.

Hundreds of Russian students came to the University of Alaska campuses in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and exchange programs took Alaskan students to Russia. Sylvia Matson, whose ancestors were mostly Finns, had recently moved up from Sandstone, Minnesota, to join her husband, who had found a job as a mechanic at Bering Air. Not only is her husband also a Finn, but his name is also Matson—just by coincidence, because both families, when they arrived in the U.S., replaced their complicated Finnish last names with Matson, after a transoceanic shipping company. When she heard about the exchange program with Russia, she pushed to be accepted for it, even though she was a part-time student and not really qualified to apply. An exception was made, and in 1990 she and four other Alaskan students began the fall semester at the State Pedagogical Institute of Magadan, the public university in that city about twelve hundred miles west of Provideniya.

Magadan had a deadly reputation in the Stalin era, as a hub for Gulag mines where political prisoners slaved sometimes to death and produced gold and other minerals in the process. Matson arrived in September and moved in with a host family in which the father was a doctor and the mother an engineer. The entire district was rationing food, and people did not have a lot to eat. She thinks the family got extra food because she was staying with them. She ended up spending more of her time teaching than learning. Russians who speak English tend to have British accents, but as relations with the U.S. improved there was a vogue for speaking with an American accent. The students and teachers with whom Matson practiced English for many hours a day could not get enough of talking to her, and almost wore her out. They may have been surprised to learn afterward that other Americans they spoke to assumed they had learned their English in Minnesota.

With other students, she went on excursions into the forest, or taiga, saw abandoned and crumbling Gulag camps, rarely ate in the dining hall at the Pedagogical Institute (whose food was “really challenging”), and joined in the parade in early November honoring the glorious October Revolution. The school made clear that the American students were required to be a part of the event, which turned out to involve not marching but just kind of walking down Lenin Avenue to Lenin Square and buying stuff from street venders. She got the impression that the Russians who attended did not really want to be there.

In general, Matson and the other exchange students didn’t have much to do but be American. People invited them to dinner in their apartments. “There were families that asked me to come just because they wanted an American in their home,” Matson said. “It was humbling. To be treated to a lavish meal, and to have their children put on a special performance for you. And the little girls would give you their favorite doll—it was heartbreaking, and you couldn’t say no. Or they would just gaze at you and want to sit beside you on the couch. They dearly wanted to give to you because you had gifted them with your presence in their home. It was hard for me to know how to navigate that, at age twenty-four.

“When I left, in mid-December, my host family presented me with a lot of gifts, and a fur hat, and I knew there was an expectation that I invite them to visit me in Nome. But I couldn’t do that, for private reasons. I disappointed them, I know, and we did not keep in touch. Now my husband is retiring from Bering Air at the end of this year, and we’re moving back to Minnesota. We just sold our house and sent a container of our belongings on the container barge down to the Lower Forty-eight. As I was packing up and throwing out, I put aside the gifts the kids and grownups had given me in Magadan, and I’ve donated them to the historical museum here. The Russian women always said I didn’t dress up enough or use enough makeup. I still had the tin of pancake makeup they gave me. Now the museum has it, along with my students’ notes of appreciation, and the kids’ drawings, and a Russian Soviet Republic flag, and the dolls from the little girls. The museum says that at some point it will do a display about the years when Nome was in friendly contact with the Russians, and I’m glad these things will be in it.”

My own trip from Nome across the border happened in August, 1999. I flew Bering Air in a tour group consisting of two couples and me. Vladimir Bychkov, our guide, who met us in Provideniya, is a Russian Army kid from Chukotka, born when his father was stationed there. A mild and competent man, he would later become Provideniya’s mayor, occupying the same office once held by Jim Stimpfle’s first Russian contact, the apparently ill-fated Oleg Kulinkin. I had travelled a bit in western Russia by then, and Provideniya looked like other post-Soviet towns, except that large parts of it were ruins. After the Soviet Union ended, in 1991, remote places like this had been left on their own. The city’s population dropped drastically, and many of the high-rises were empty, with their windows smashed out and small waterfalls flowing down their front steps. After a few days in the town, we travelled by Army vehicle and boat to visit Native villages and stayed in fishing shacks or tents.

About a year later, the mood in the region had changed. People were talking about Roman Abramovich, the oil-and-aluminum billionaire, who was running for governor of Chukotka, mystifying everybody. Why would one of the world’s richest men want to be the governor of this abandoned, farthest-flung part of Russia? But he soon began to campaign throughout Chukotka and give money to local charities, and in December, 2000, he won the election, replacing the almost comically corrupt previous governor, Aleksandr Nazarov. Abramovich then opened new businesses in Anadyr and set about spending more of his own money on bettering the lives of local residents. He and his team rehabbed housing, repaired roads, reimbursed residents who had gone for years without receiving their salaries, brought in ships carrying food and supplies, and paid for talented kids from the region to study in Alaska. Chukotka residents hung portraits of Abramovich in their apartments the way Soviet citizens once hung portraits of Lenin.

I became friends with Ken and Tandy Wallack, whose company, Circumpolar Expeditions, had arranged my visit. They live in Anchorage, where many of Abramovich’s projects took him. The Wallacks have worked on all kinds of journeys on the other side of the strait. When an American adventurer with time and money wanted to go up the coast of Chukotka and across to the U.S. in a Native umiak, or walrus-skin boat, to show that humans could have come to North America by boat rather than on land—a kind of sub-Arctic Kon-Tiki—the Wallacks found Native people to make his boat for him and guide him. The Wallacks also helped Fiat, the Italian car company, negotiate the Russia-to-Alaska leg of a publicity trip around the world in special heavy-duty Iveco trucks, and handled logistical problems for Philippe Croizon, the French quadruple amputee and distance swimmer, when he swam between the Russian and American islands that Lynne Cox had linked in her famous cross-border swim in 1987. The Wallacks speak only English, but they have a gift for understanding the heavily accented English that different kinds of people speak, and then repeating it in English that interpreters can understand.

At the request of Abramovich, who had hired them, and whom they remember as pleasant and unassuming, they found places to stay for the hundred and fifty Chukotka high-school students he brought to Anchorage in groups of fifty at a time. The Wallacks set up visits to public schools, trips to McDonald’s, and other American activities. “For some reason, Abramovich wanted them all to go bowling,” Tandy Wallack said. “So we found a bowling alley for them and got them started—none of them had ever bowled—and they bowled.” The oligarch came and went in his private jet and kept a spare jet in Anchorage in case another might be needed at short notice.

In 2008, for reasons as opaque as his intentions in taking on the role, Abramovich resigned his governorship and went elsewhere in his extremely complicated and tiring-to-think-about billionaire’s world. The charities he set up for the people of Chukotka continued to exist, supposedly, but the interlude of benign mega-capitalist visitation in this part of the world was over.

“It all just kind of petered out,” Jim Stimpfle told me, in the Polar Cub Café. “The time of druzhba [friendship] across the border just ended. I went back to real estate full time. My wife had got tired of my spending so much effort with all this Russia business. And there was all the corruption, and the shakedowns, especially the landing fees that the Russian airports kept jacking up for Alaska Airlines and Bering Air, who both finally had to stop flying over there.” Alaska Airlines ended all its flights to the Russian Far East in 1998. Bering Air continued to operate an occasional charter flight until service to Russia entirely stopped with the war.

Part of the problem was that most people in the Russian Far East remained too poor to come to the U.S. or trade across the border in any meaningful way. Russia also began to be perceived as too dangerous. There were stories of American sailors beaten and robbed in Anadyr, of Japanese nature-documentary crews arrested and then released only after all their equipment had been confiscated. On one of the Wallacks’ trips to Chukotka, in the twenty-tens, when they were helping to make a documentary about an Alaska Native’s search for her relatives, authorities in the village of Lavrentiya detained them and their crew for having forgotten some paperwork. One by one, the Americans had to appear before a judge, plead guilty, and pay a fine. Some of the Native people of Chukotka, for their part, had grown tired of the stream of evangelists from North America. A Canadian preacher made a video of Natives screaming and crying and throwing themselves on the floor during a come-to-Jesus moment that he had brought about. Other Natives found the video demeaning when it was circulated. A few neighborly gestures still occurred—in the winter of 2012, Nome almost ran out of heating oil, and a Russian tanker arrived in mid-January to resupply the city. But after Russia’s seizure of Crimea, in 2014, remaining civilian communication across the strait began to shut down, and it dwindled to nothing in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Nome’s geographic internationality helped inspire Jim Stimpfle to work for Russian-American understanding and peace. Since February, 2022, it has motivated other Nome-ites to go to war.

Mark Hayward, a military veteran and a former Special Forces medic who moved to Nome in 2018 with his wife, was in the predominantly Native community of Savoonga, on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, on February 24, 2022, the day of the invasion. He had gone there as an employee of the Norton Sound Health Corporation to teach residents how to be their own first responders and save lives until victims could be air-transported to better medical care in Anchorage or Seattle. You can’t see Russia from Wasilla, Alaska, but, if you go up on a hill on a clear day, you can see it from St. Lawrence Island. “I’m ashamed to admit, I had checked out of the world,” Hayward told me, by phone. “But, when that invasion happened, I was so freakin’ mad. There’s the Russian coast, less than a hundred miles from Savoonga. If Putin can roll tanks into his neighbor, why wouldn’t he send a sub up here to sink a tanker carrying the oil that keeps my family alive in the winter? When I got home, I knew what I had to do, and so did my wife. She said, ‘You’ve read the news. Get your ass on a plane and get over there.’ ” He left soon afterward, intending to join the foreign-volunteer legion defending Ukraine.

I first learned about Hayward from an article in the Washington Post by Zachariah Hughes, a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News. (He is a college friend of my daughter’s; she put the two of us in touch.) Hughes had gone to Nome last winter and met Hayward in person, but by the time I went, in September, readers of the Post article had sent Hayward money to support his war efforts; one had even funded his return to Ukraine. While walking around Nome, I came upon and tried to make sense of the city’s former hospital building, which sprawls in an indeterminate shape and contains the offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles, a car-repair garage, a pawnshop, the Nome courthouse, and the labyrinthine workshops of Rolland Trowbridge, an enterprising man who bought the building and damaged his knee crawling around in its crannies as he rehabbed it for its present uses. Trowbridge is a collaborator of Hayward’s, and has assembled military matériel in his workshop for Hayward to send to Ukraine via the international courier Meest, which specializes in transporting packages between Ukraine and North America.

I found Trowbridge by asking at the pawnshop. He’s a tall and big man with a well-trimmed beard and mustache, thick, dark eyebrows, and no hair at all north of that. For everyday life, he wears work boots and button-downs. He showed me what he was working on: shrapnel-deterring body armor made of Kevlar fabric sewn with Kevlar thread on his extra-large sail-making sewing machine. (Trowbridge is a sailor who first came to Nome in his own sailboat, amazingly, from Michigan.) In other nooks sat a one-person motorized paraglider that has a range of a hundred and fifty miles and resembles something that Wile E. Coyote might use, and several intricate multifaceted handheld devices for jamming the radio signals that guide drones.

In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Nome residents had joined Jim Stimpfle in his projects of trans-strait druzhba; now dozens of them, by Trowbridge’s estimation, are helping Trowbridge and Hayward help Ukraine. Nome-ites have donated supplies, labor, and money raised at benefit events. He showed me slides of two used yellow-and-green Mercedes-Benz ambulances that he and Hayward bought with the money they raised, and drove from the U.K. to Ukraine in the summer of 2024. His and Hayward’s main achievement so far, he said, has been generating power for a Ukrainian arsenal of Javelin missiles that lacked functioning ignition and guidance systems. He said that by tinkering they put together twelve-volt motorbike batteries with improvised wiring that got the Javelins’ circuitry to work. Then the Ukrainians took these high-tech armor-piercing weapons to the front and “started poppin’ tanks” with them, Trowbridge said, forcing the Russians to turn back their advance on the city of Mykolaiv, a maneuver that could have led to the encirclement of the entire Black Sea region.

He showed me shelves and tables heaped with black, shiny Chinese electronics that he was testing and adapting. “I happen to know a lot about which Chinese equipment is good and which is junk, and how to order the best, which the Ukrainians generally can’t. And you always need to keep buying more of it because drone warfare is changing every day.”

Later, when I talked to Hayward in Mykolaiv from my hotel in Anchorage, he texted me a photograph of a sea-mammal-harpoon point made of shiny steel that he had brought to Ukraine from Savoonga. He also has a motorized paraglider with him. He said he planned to attach the point to a spear and take it up with him in the paraglider so he can harpoon an Orlan-10, one of the sophisticated drones that are killing Ukrainians. “I’m in this war all the way,” Hayward said. “I’ve spent down my I.R.A. and run through my savings. If Putin isn’t stopped here, he will keep on going, and we will all end up living in his gangster world. I’ll give everything I’ve got to stop him, and if I spend all my kids’ inheritance and more helping to create a world where aggression like this cannot stand, that’s an inheritance I’m proud to leave.”

In Nome, Trowbridge told me that he is worried about Hayward. He said, “I’m afraid Mark won’t be satisfied until he gets himself killed there.”

Gay Sheffield, the Bering Strait agent for the University of Alaska’s marine-advisory program in Nome, responds to concerns about sea mammals, subsistence-food sourcing, and environmental change in the region. She also serves as the commissioner of the Port of Nome. The scientific papers she has written or contributed to get down to the real details of life in the area. As someone who has spent a lot of my free time removing debris from trees in the five boroughs of New York City, I was drawn to a 2021 paper, of which she was the principal author, about a “marine debris event” in the Bering Strait in 2020. The study reported that, over the past two decades, five hundred metric tons of seaborne garbage had been collected from the shorelines in and near fifteen coastal communities. Much of it was “industrial fisheries debris”—floats and nets, pallets, deck boots, and various other items “with Russian, Korean, or other Asian lettering.”

Kitchen trash, vegetables, roach-spray cans, air fresheners, bathroom cleaners, a Russian Navy sailor’s cap, disposable gloves, water jugs, food packaging, juice bottles, men’s body-wash bottles—all had sloshed around in the strait and washed up on Alaskan shores. The absence of tampons or diapers in the debris suggested predominantly all-male groups of litterers, such as tanker or fishing-boat crews. The study said the debris could have come from a foreign ship that sank—given the lack of information from the Russian side, who could say? It stated and restated that without meaningful international communication the debris problem cannot be solved.

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic. I hoped to meet Sheffield, so I stopped by the University of Alaska campus when I was in Nome, but she was on a research trip. When I spoke to her later, she told me that the federal government is not focussed on what is going on in the region. “Only two federal agencies are still in Nome,” she said. “The F.A.A. and the post office. The Parks Service office is closed because of the shutdown. NOAA has reduced its presence. So that means that, basically, the citizens of Nome and the coastal villages are trying to keep track of what’s going on in the region by themselves.

“The toxic algal bloom that happened in 2022 was by far the largest event of its kind ever seen in the U.S.,” she went on. “It stretched for more than six hundred kilometres in the strait and the Chukchi Sea, and certainly must have extended into the Russian side. Ultimately, we have no idea how much harm it caused, since much of it was carried out into the open sea, and onto the Russian coast. A lot of marine animals died, but we can’t be sure whether it was the algae that caused it. Consuming toxic marine life would have caused serious health problems in the region. The warming of the water and the continuing absence of sea ice have consequences. A big one has been the increase in industrial maritime traffic. More and more Russian tankers are bringing liquefied natural gas from the Gulf of Ob through the Russian Arctic, through the strait, and down to China. The federal managers for our maritime resources may have stopped paying very much attention to the region, but the Russians and the Chinese and those of us who live here have not.”

At the Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, in St. Petersburg, Russia, there is a model of the Earth about fifteen feet across that you can walk around and study from above. What makes it different from other big globes is that it represents only the top part of the planet, no more than a quarter of the total sphere—that is, the entire Arctic and a few degrees latitude below it. Mead Treadwell, who moved to Alaska forty-seven years ago to work on Wally Hickel’s campaign for governor, has prospered there in the pipeline and telecommunications businesses, held political office (lieutenant governor), and served on many Arctic commissions, forums, and institutes. He knows that top part of the planet as well as anybody. I missed him in Anchorage, but met up with him a week later in New York, at another place of convergences, the Explorers Club, on East Seventieth Street. His conversation centered on Alaska but swooped all over that top-view, Arctic-focussed globe—from the Bering Strait to Prudhoe Bay to Russia’s Taymyr Peninsula to Greenland to Iceland to Finland to Wrangel Island, that island beyond the beyond, north of Chukotka, where Treadwell made two expeditions in 1990 that qualified him to become a member of this club.

He agreed with Gay Sheffield that we don’t pay enough attention to our Arctic. “The Barents countries, like Norway, Sweden, and Finland—and also the Laplanders who inhabit them—know much more about their end of the Arctic than we do about ours,” he said. He talked about the natural-gas fields of the far north, and described a fleet of Korean-built, Finnish-designed liquefied-natural-gas (L.N.G.) icebreaker tankers that have spoon-shaped bows and pointed sterns so they can go bow first or stern first, depending on the nature of the ice, and transport L.N.G. to China from western Russia via the Arctic route efficiently and economically. (He believes we should copy them in moving our own North Slope L.N.G. from Prudhoe Bay by sea, rather than relying on pipelines.) Communication between the U.S. and Russia across the strait still exists, he said. On issues of marine safety, search and rescue, and environmental emergency, the U.S. Coast Guard in Juneau still talks to the Russian border-security agents in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and vice versa.

On the question of what is to be done today, he doesn’t know. “I always say that citizen-to-citizen diplomacy opened the border in the nineteen-eighties,” Treadwell said. “And failures of big-country diplomacy contributed to its closing, which started with Putin in 2000. First, Putin discouraged regional governors from doing international relations. Then he told the regions that he would be appointing the governors, and the citizens would no longer be voting on them. Those changes took power away from this neighborhood of the globe. His rise is a lot of the reason the border shut down. I think we could’ve done more with other Arctic-facing countries to counter that shift in power and keep our neighborhoods healthy.

“But there’s always change,” he continued. “A delegation of businessmen accompanied Putin on his recent Alaskan summit with Trump. I don’t know what subjects were discussed. But a lot can be done internationally with mining, shipping, fisheries, energy extraction, and tourism in our shared Arctic. Just because our Russian border appears to be mostly closed, don’t think people aren’t thinking about and planning for a different future.”

In September, 2022, two men who lived in the town of Egvekinot, in Chukotka, decided to escape from military recruiters who had been knocking on their doors. The men filled a sixteen-foot outboard motorboat with supplies and containers of gasoline and set out across the bay next to their village, then braved the open Bering Sea. After several days’ journey, they reached St. Lawrence Island—U.S. soil. Somehow, they had avoided swamping, sinking, drowning, exposure, hypothermia, or capture by the Russian border patrol. Soon after they arrived, U.S. immigration officers flew over from the mainland, arrested them, and brought them to a detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

The office of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, in Tacoma, took their case, and by January, 2023, it had won their release. According to Nicolas McKee, the staff attorney who represents both men, one of them has received asylum and lives in Washington State. The other is waiting for a decision in Alaska, where he has a fishing job in a Russian-speaking community.

Some thirty-five thousand Russians travelled by various routes to the southern border of the U.S. and asked for asylum there in the war’s first year alone; many have suffered in long confinement and with uncertain prospects. As far as anyone knows, the two men from Egvekinot are the only recent Russian asylum seekers to have come from the part of Russia where the United States is so close that under the right circumstances you can see it. McKee thinks that anyone else who succeeds in crossing the Russian-Alaskan border, as his clients did, will also have a good chance of receiving asylum. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695ea96e40e629c67c05020d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r48407.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 07:58:05.528895

Protest disrupts church services in St. Paul

What we know:

Activists with the Racial Justice Network disrupted church services at Cities Church in St. Paul to oppose a pastor at the church.

Protesters went to the church because they say the pastor in question, David Easterwood, is also the acting field office director for ICE in Minnesota. The protest was documented in part by former CNN anchor turned YouTuber Don Lemon. Video from Black Lives Matter Minnesota also show protesters chanting during services.

""This cannot be a house of God while harboring someone directing ICE agents to wreak havoc on our community,"" attorney Nekima Levy-Armstrong told Lemon during his livestream, explaining why the group was at the church. ""I am a reverend on top of being a lawyer and an activist, so I come here in the power of the almighty God.""

Dig deeper:

FOX 9 can confirm a man named David Easterwood is the acting field office director in Minnesota. Easterwood is routinely named in DHS court filings. However, FOX 9 wasn't able to confirm acting director is the same David Easterwood listed as a pastor on the CIties Church website.

The other side:

Easterwood did not appear to be on hand for Sunday's services. But the church's lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, did speak with Lemon.

Parnell said the protests inside the church were ""shameful."" ""It's shameful to see anyone interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship,"" said Parnell. ""I have to take care of my church and my family.""

Parnell then asked Lemon to leave unless he was there to worship.

DOJ says they are investigating

What they're saying:

Sunday afternoon, hours after the protests, officials with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were looking into the disruption.

In tweets, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon responded to video of the protest by writing: ""We are on it @CivilRights, working with the USAO in Minneapolis. This is un-American and outrageous.""

Dhillon later added: ""The @CivilRights is investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers. Considering and investigating other related crimes as well. @FBI activated too!""

The FACE Act prohibits the use of force to prevent people from receiving reproductive health services, or exercising First Amendment rights at a place of worship.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/cities-church-protest.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:40.245097

But it did include statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security that were not part of what Alfonsi had used before her story was pulled. Some of statements, which were carried in full on the “60 Minutes” website, were dated prior to Dec. 21.

“Since November, ‘60 Minutes’ has made several attempts to interview key Trump administration officials on camera about our story,” Alfonsi said. “They declined our requests.”

Alfonsi did not immediately return a message from The Associated Press on Sunday. She said in her email that the administration’s refusal to consent to on-camera interviews was a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.

CBS says it was always going to air the piece

CBS News, in a statement said, that its “leadership has always been committed to airing the ”60 Minutes” CECOT piece as soon as it was ready. Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories, all of which speak to CBS News’ independence and the power of our storytelling.”

Alfonsi’s report was the second of three on Sunday’s show, with the lead story being Cecilia Vega’s report from Minneapolis about ICE enforcement efforts and the protests to its tactics.

The initial decision to sideline Alfonsi’s CECOT story became a flashpoint for critics who said the appointment of Weiss, founder of the Free Press website who had no previous experience in television news, represented an attempt by the network’s new corporate leadership to curry favor with Trump.

While pulled from the broadcast in December, Alfonsi’s original story mistakenly became available online. CBS News had fed a version of the newsmagazine to Global Television, a network that airs “60 Minutes” in Canada, which posted it on its website before the last-minute switch removing the piece.

That enabled sharp-eyed viewers to see what Weiss had rejected, offering the opportunity to compare it to what “60 Minutes” eventually put on the air.

The body of the story was unchanged. It included a brief clip of President Donald Trump saying the prison operators “don’t play games,” and one from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying that “heinous monsters, rapists, murderers, sexual assaulters, predators who have no right to be in this country” were sent there.

Alfonsi’s introduction was updated to lead with the Jan. 3 U.S. raid that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, currently held in U.S. custody. She changed the end of the story to include the administration comment, including its explanation for not providing detailed records on the migrants sent to El Salvador.

The administration also provided photos of tattoos worn by the two migrants Alfonsi interviewed, including one swastika that the interviewee said he had gotten as a teen-ager not knowing what it meant.

The CBS-administration relationship has evolved

Since Weiss’ appointment, Trump administration officials have been more visible on CBS News, in interviews that she sometimes helped arrange. The president himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on “60 Minutes” on Nov. 2.

The New York Times reported Saturday that after Trump was interviewed last week by new “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil, Leavitt told the network that “we’ll sue your ass off” if the exchange wasn’t aired in full.

All of the 13-minute interview was shown Tuesday, an unusual step for one of the broadcast networks’ evening newscasts, a half hour summary of the day’s big stories. CBS told The Times that it had decided to run the interview unedited at the time it was booked.

Trump has objected in the past to how his interviews have been edited — including releasing an unedited transcript of an interview conducted by Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” in 2020.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F06%2F796ff77b45da90fcc169f06ab782%2Fcorrection-media-60-minutes-trump-67068.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:00.868121

Bruce Springsteen criticized the Trump administration's deployment of ICE agents to Minneapolis and the fatal shooting by an ICE agent of Renee Good in comments at the Light of Day Winterfest main event show Saturday, Jan. 17 at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank.

“I wrote this song as an ode to American possibility,” said Springsteen while introducing “The Promised Land.” “It was about a both beautiful but flawed country, that we are, and the country that we could be. Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it's never been in modern times.”

The audience broke into applause.

“Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now,” Springsteen said. “So as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty and believe the truth still matters, you must speak out and it's worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it. If you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens. If you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, send a message to this president as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the (expletive) out of Minneapolis.”

More waves of cheers came from the audience.

“This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three, American Renee Good,” said Springsteen, who then played the opening notes of “The Promised Land” on harmonica.

The Springsteen intro was similar to the Boss' state of democracy speeches he gave during the E Street Band's tour of Europe last year, which also criticized the Trump administration.

President Trump responded by attacking Springsteen on social media several times in response, including sharing a meme that depicted Trump hitting a golf ball and striking Springsteen, which knocks him down on stage.

The Light of Day, which has been supported by Springsteen, raises funds and awareness in the fight against Parkinson's and related diseases. In accordance with Light of Day history, Springsteen was not an announced artist at Saturday's show, which included performances by Gary “U.S.” Bonds, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie, Dramarama, Remember Jones, Fantastic Cat, Williams Honor, James Maddock, Joe D’Urso and Stone Caravan, Wille Nile and more.

Springsteen first appeared on Saturday with Nile when he and Maddock joined the rocker for his “One Guitar.” The Boss returned to join Gruschecky and the Houserockers as they backed Bonds on “Jole Blon.”

“I knew they was going to start some (expletive),” said Bonds as he embraced by Springsteen.

“Bonds is (expletive) 86 years (expletive) old,” said Springsteen, 76. The Boss was instrumental in revitalizing Bonds' career in the early '80s by penning hits like “This Little Girl,” performed on Saturday, for Bonds.

“I got at least 10 more years in me, I know that,” Springsteen said.

“I love these young folks,” Bonds said. “I'm going to teach them how to rock 'n' roll.”

There was lots of rock ’n’ roll on stage Saturday night as the show lasted six hours, ending at 12:30 a.m. The nightcap was a performance of Springsteen's “Light of Day,” and then a rendition of Happy Birthday for festival founder Bob Benjamin, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1996.

He's now confined to a wheelchair. Springsteen stroked his hand after singing.

“This is somebody who has done more for the fight against Parkinson's than anybody I know,” Springsteen said. “Bob Benjamin, let's sing for him.”

The Boss ended the show with an acoustic rendition of “Thunder Road” with an audience singalong.

The recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer has further inflamed tensions surrounding the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, which have been present throughout President Trump’s second term.

Trump on Thursday warned of using the Insurrection Act following demonstrations in Minneapolis, but said a day later there was no reason to invoke the law immediately.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters.

On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed her agency is working on an internal review of the actions of the ICE officer that killed Renee Good.

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz) also said Sunday that he believes “ICE needs to be totally torn down.”

“It has to be created in the image of what people want, right? And what does that look like?” Gallego told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “From my experience running in Arizona, in a very hard, hard state when it comes to immigration and immigration issues, people want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals, right, and focuses on criminals, and immigration enforcement that is actually focused on security, and not the goon squad that has come from Stephen Miller and Donald Trump.”

Gov. Abigail Spanberger moved swiftly on immigration policy in her opening slate of executive orders, rescinding a directive from her Republican predecessor that expanded Virginia’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The order repeals former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Department of Corrections to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE. The order also encouraged local police and sheriffs to do the same.

Repealing Executive Order 47 does not terminate existing 287(g) agreements. Under their terms, the agreements remain in effect until they are suspended or terminated by either party.

Spanberger’s executive order argues that the policy diverted limited law-enforcement resources away from core public safety functions.

It reads: “This executive order rescinds Executive Order 47, which requires and encourages state and local law enforcement to divert their limited resources for use in enforcing federal civil immigration laws,” the order states. “Ensuring public safety in Virginia requires state and local law enforcement to be focused on their core responsibilities of investigating and deterring criminal activity, staffing jails, and community engagement.”

Under 287(g) agreements, state and local law-enforcement agencies — including sheriffs’ offices and police departments — are authorized to carry out limited federal immigration enforcement duties under ICE supervision. Those functions can include identifying people in jail who may be subject to deportation, serving certain administrative immigration warrants on people already in custody, and, in some cases, deputizing officers with limited ICE authority during routine law-enforcement work.

According to ICE’s website, there are currently 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving local governments, state agencies and correctional facilities. Five of those agreements are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law-enforcement agencies.

Spanberger previewed the move in her inaugural remarks on Saturday, emphasizing her administration’s approach to immigrant communities.

“Our hardworking, law-abiding, immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them too,” Spanberger said.

Youngkin’s original order declared that “Virginia is not a sanctuary state” and argued that the “nexus between illegal immigration and dangerous criminal activity is real.” The policy drew condemnation from immigrant-rights groups and the ACLU of Virginia, while Democratic lawmakers criticized it as a misallocation of resources that undermined trust between communities and law enforcement.

House Republican Leader Terry Kilgore said the decision to end 287(g) agreements for state police would make Virginia less safe.

“This decision allows criminal illegal immigrants to remain in our communities and commit crimes over and over again by shielding them from cooperation with federal law enforcement,” Kilgore said. “That is not public safety — it is reckless.”

Former Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said the move was a “disaster for public safety.”

“Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised,” Miyares posted on X.

Mary Bauer, executive director for the ACLU of Virginia, said Spanberger’s executive order was a good start but that she now must end 287(g) agreements between state agencies and ICE.

“It is not the job of Virginia’s law enforcement agencies to carry out the Trump administration’s brutal and fear-based anti-immigrant agenda,” Bauer said. “(Spanberger’s) executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families.",https://www.virginiascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0400-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:09.635315

Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.
Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.","1. Introduction

In Doe v. HHS (5th Cir. Jan. 16, 2026), Dr. John Doe—a physician challenging an Adverse Action Report (“AAR”) lodged in the National Practitioner Data Bank—sought reconsideration from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) of a prior refusal to remove the AAR. HHS denied the request with a terse rationale: that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.”

After Doe sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in the Eastern District of Texas, HHS defended on a different theory: that it denied reconsideration on the merits because Doe failed to identify new evidence sufficient to reopen. The district court dismissed the APA claim, treating the denial as effectively unreviewable because Doe had not presented new evidence.

The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that HHS’s shift in rationale violated the Chenery principle: a reviewing court may assess agency action only on the grounds the agency itself invoked in the administrative record.

Key issues

Whether HHS may defend an agency decision on a litigation rationale different from the rationale stated in the final agency action.

Whether HHS’s stated “ineligibility” ground was consistent with its own guidance governing reconsideration.

What remedy is appropriate when Chenery is violated at the motion-to-dismiss stage in an APA case.

Parties

Plaintiff–Appellant: John Doe, M.D., Ph.D.

Defendant–Appellee: United States Department of Health and Human Services

2. Summary of the Opinion

The Fifth Circuit held that HHS’s litigation position—asserting a merits-based denial for lack of new evidence—could not be used to uphold an agency action that, on its face, denied relief because Doe was “not eligible” for reconsideration. Applying SEC v. Chenery Corp, the court ruled that it could not credit post hoc rationalizations offered by agency counsel.

The court further observed that HHS’s own guidance contemplated that upon a reconsideration request, the agency would either affirm the prior decision or issue a revised final decision—yet HHS instead declared Doe “not eligible” for reconsideration, a position the court said was “not true” under the guidance language. The Fifth Circuit therefore reversed the dismissal of the APA claim and remanded for further proceedings.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) SEC v. Chenery Corp, 332 U.S. 194 (1947)

The decision rests on Chenery’s “simple but fundamental rule” that a court must judge an agency action “solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.” In Doe v. HHS, that meant the court could not affirm (or sustain a dismissal premised on) a rationale HHS did not provide to Doe in the administrative record. The operative ground was “not eligible for additional administrative review,” not “we reviewed your new evidence and reject it on the merits.”

2) Calcutt v. FDIC, 598 U.S. 623 (2023) (per curiam)

The Fifth Circuit used Calcutt v. FDIC to reinforce the modern Supreme Court’s insistence that courts are “powerless” to affirm agency action by “substituting” a better rationale when the agency’s own reasoning is “inadequate or improper.” Here, the district court’s approach—accepting the litigation theory that the denial rested on lack of new evidence—was functionally a substitution of grounds inconsistent with Calcutt’s instruction.

3) Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156 (1962)

Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States supplies the more specific administrative-law admonition that appellate courts may not accept “post hoc rationalizations” and that an agency order must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself. The Fifth Circuit treated HHS’s merits-based defense on appeal as exactly the sort of post hoc rationalization Burlington forbids.

4) McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1988)

The panel cited McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas in connection with the proposition that agencies must adhere to mandatory procedural language in their own guidance (or at least must supply a lawful explanation if they depart from it). The Fifth Circuit invoked this authority while noting HHS’s guidance describing what happens after a reconsideration request—suggesting HHS did not do what it promised it would do.

5) Prior litigation involving Doe and the AAR

The opinion situates the dispute against extensive prior proceedings where Doe tried to remove the AAR, including:

Doe v. Rogers, 139 F. Supp. 3d 120 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Doe I”)

[Doe] v. Rogers, 656 F. Supp. 3d 78 (D.D.C. 2023) (“Doe II”), aff’d sub nom. Doe v. Rodgers, No. 20-5297, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 3540 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2023) (“Doe III”), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 328 (2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., No. 181 N.Y.S.3d 884 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Medical Center et al., No. 2:10-cv-05588 (E.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 2, 2010)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., 59 N.Y.S.3d 310 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017)

While these cases did not control the Chenery issue, they provide the procedural posture for why Doe sought reconsideration based on discovery materials and why HHS’s characterization of what it did on reconsideration mattered for APA review.

6) Judge Haynes’s pro se deference authorities

In a concurrence in part and dissent in part, Judge Haynes cited: Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989) and Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972), emphasizing that pro se filings are construed with deference. Those cases informed Judge Haynes’s proposed procedural remedy (a limited remand to allow fuller presentation to the district court), though the majority resolved the appeal on Chenery grounds as to the APA claim.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) The agency’s stated ground controls

The majority framed the case as one where its “analysis begins and ends” with the agency’s stated rationale. HHS’s final agency action said only that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.” Under Chenery, that statement set the boundaries of judicial review: the court could not treat the decision as if it instead said “we considered your new evidence and deny reopening on the merits.”

2) A guidance mismatch underscored the inadequacy of the “ineligible” rationale

The court found the “not eligible” rationale inconsistent with HHS’s published guidance. The opinion quotes the National Practitioner Data Bank Guidebook as describing two outcomes after a reconsideration request: “Either the previous decision will be affirmed” or a “revised final decision will be issued.” The agency did neither; it issued a threshold ineligibility denial, contrary to the guidance’s described process. That mismatch mattered because it made the agency’s stated ground appear factually and procedurally defective, and it prevented the court from accepting HHS’s later attempt to recast the denial as merits-based.

3) The district court’s dismissal could not stand once the rationale shifted

The district court dismissed the APA claim on the understanding that Doe “failed to present any new evidence,” treating the denial of reconsideration as unreviewable on that basis. The Fifth Circuit held that approach effectively relied on a rationale not provided by the agency to the applicant—and, indeed, contradicted by the agency’s own written “not eligible” statement. Under Chenery and its progeny, that warranted reversal and remand.

4) Remedy: reversal and remand for further proceedings

The court did not decide the ultimate merits of Doe’s APA claim. It vacated the dismissal and remanded so that the case proceeds with the agency action judged on its stated ground (or for further agency explanation consistent with administrative-law requirements). The remedy reflects Chenery’s standard solution: the agency must supply the lawful, contemporaneous rationale in the record, not through later advocacy.

C. Impact

1) Litigation discipline for agencies: the record must match the defense

The decision reinforces in the Fifth Circuit that agencies cannot pivot in court from a threshold rationale (“ineligible”) to an alternative rationale (merits-based “no new evidence”) to avoid review or shore up a weak administrative explanation. For agency litigators, the case is a warning that the administrative decision letter and record must contain the grounds the government expects to defend.

2) Procedural regularity in reconsideration regimes

Although the opinion is brief, its reliance on the Guidebook’s mandatory-seeming description suggests heightened scrutiny when an agency’s reconsideration procedures are framed in “either/or” terms and the agency instead chooses a third option (ineligibility) without explanation. Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.

3) Administrative law, not NPDB merits, drives the holding

The ruling does not establish substantive standards for removing AARs or interpreting the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (“HCQIA”). Its precedential force lies in administrative law: courts in the Fifth Circuit will police explanation-shifting and require agencies to stand on what they said when they acted.

4) Interaction with pro se considerations (Judge Haynes’s view)

Judge Haynes would have affirmed the unappealed constitutional claims and preferred a limited remand to permit counsel-developed arguments to be aired first in the district court, invoking the deference owed to pro se litigants. Even though the majority did not adopt that procedural framing, the separate writing signals that, on remand, district courts may be receptive to fuller development where initial briefing was pro se—while still remaining bound by Chenery’s restriction on post hoc agency rationales.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): A federal statute that allows courts to review many final agency actions to ensure the agency acted lawfully and provided a reasoned explanation.

Final agency action: The agency’s definitive position (often a letter or decision) that marks the end of the administrative process and is typically what courts review.

Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.

Post hoc rationalization: A justification offered after the fact (in court) that is not found in the agency’s original decision.

National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB): A federal repository that includes certain adverse reports about medical practitioners; hospitals and other entities consult it for credentialing and privileging decisions.

Adverse Action Report (AAR): A report submitted (here, by a hospital) reflecting an adverse professional action, potentially affecting a physician’s career opportunities.

Reconsideration vs. reopening: Agencies sometimes allow a party to ask the agency to revisit a prior decision; such requests often require “new evidence” or similar showings. The key in this case is that whatever the agency’s standard is, it must be the standard the agency states and applies in the record.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the Trump administration and different government agencies of using racial profiling to conduct illegal stops and arrests in Minnesota.

According to The Hill, the lawsuit names defendants including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Both agencies have a heavy presence in Minnesota, which is currently being targeted by unprecedented immigration-enforcement actions.

“Masked federal agents in the thousands are violently stopping and arresting countless Minnesotans based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity irrespective of their citizenship or immigration status, or their personal circumstances. At the center of DHS’s campaign are Somali and Latino people, who are being targeted for stops and arrests based on racial profiling motivated by prejudice,” the lawsuit alleges.

“DHS’s crude dragnet ensnares non-citizens, including individuals with immigration status, without warrants or any lawful basis for arrest,” the lawsuit says. “And its discriminatory practices also sweep in numerous US citizens in the process, shackling them and scanning their faces while ignoring documentation of US citizenship.”

In court filings, the American Civil Liberties Union described the experience of plaintiff Mubashir Khalif Hussen, who claims to have been detained by immigration agents despite repeatedly telling them that he is a U.S. citizen. Both Hussen and the ACLU say that ICE refused repeated requests to inspect Hussen’s identification.

“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” Hussen said. “They did not ask me for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota, or anything else about my circumstances.”

After his initial detention, Hussen was taken to a government services building in Whipple, Minnesota. Only there was Hussen allowed the opportunity to retrieve and share a picture of his U.S. passport. He was ultimately released, but only after being shackled and fingerprinted.

Another plaintiff, 25-year-old Mahamed Eydarus, claims to have been shoveling snow out of a parking space with his mother when they were both surrounded by unidentified, masked federal agents. The agents did not present any identification but demanded that Eydarus prove that he was “not illegal.” During the encounter, the agents allegedly questions why Eydarus and his mother kept speaking in Somali.

“The government can’t stop and arrest people based on the color of their skin, or arrest people with no probable cause,” said Kate Huddleston, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

“These kinds of police-state tactics are contrary to the basic principles of liberty and equality that remain a bedrock of our legal system and our country,” Huddleston said.

Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s Minnesota branch, was similarly critical of the federal government’s new tactics.

“ICE and CBP’s practices are both illegal and morally reprehensible,” she said.

“Federal agents’ conduct—sweeping up Minnesotans through racial profiling and unlawful arrests—is a grave violation of Minnesotans’ most fundamental rights, and it has spread fear among immigrant communities and neighborhoods,” Ahlin-Halverson said in a statement. “No one, including federal agents, is above the law.”

The report on the facility housing migrants deported from the United States was postponed from an initial air date of Dec 21, with CBS saying it required additional reporting and would be broadcast later.

“CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the 60 Minutes CECOT piece as soon as it was ready,” the network said in a statement on Jan 18 , though the show had

on Canada’s Global TV app in December.

The broadcast on Jan 18 added comments from the US Department of Homeland Security, details of the criminal records of those deported and additional reporting on one with tattoos, the network said.

The US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial to the facility, known as CECOT.

“Last year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists,” CBS said in a programme description on the show.

In a segment of the show, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaks with two Venezuelan men who were later released, and who described conditions in the facility as “brutal and torturous”.

The segment on CECOT included accusations of torture inflicted on Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison and raised questions about how the US characterised them.

There are some heartwarming videos of agents falling down (“ICE on ice!”) but we slip too, running towards or away from them.
Lake Street, a major corridor of immigrant businesses in the neighborhood, has been crawling with ICE vehicles every morning this week.
After Good’s murder and Noem’s announcement that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would triple, everyone I know cancelled their social plans.","At 9 AM I fall in love with Amy. We’re in my friend’s old Corolla, following an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle in our neighborhood. We only know “Amy” through the Signal voice call we’re on together, alongside more than eight hundred others, all trying to coordinate sightings throughout South Minneapolis. Amy drives a silver Subaru and is directly in front of us, expertly tailing a black Wagoneer with two masked agents in front. The Wagoneer skips a red light to try and lose us, but Amy’s fast. She bolts across the intersection, Bullitt-style, and we follow just behind, shouting inside the car, GO AMY! WE LOVE YOU! “I’m gonna fucking marry Amy,” my friend says. “You think it’s chill to propose over this call?”

You can’t walk for ten minutes in my neighborhood without seeing them: boxy SUVs, mostly domestic-made, with tinted windows and out-of-state plates. Two men riding in front, dressed in tactical gear. Following behind is a train of three or four cars, honking. Sometimes there are bikers, too, blowing on neon-colored plastic whistles that local businesses give out for free. Every street corner has patrollers on foot, yelling and filming when a convoy rolls by.

If the ICE vehicles pull over, people flood the street. Crowds materialize seemingly out of nowhere. The honking and whistling amps up, becoming an unignorable wail, and more people stream out of their houses and businesses. When agents leave their cars they’re met with jeers, mostly variations on “Fuck you.” Usually someone starts throwing snowballs. Agents pull out pepper spray guns, threatening protesters who get too close. If there’s enough of a crowd, they use tear gas. Meanwhile they go about their barbaric business: they’ve pulled someone out of their car or home and are shoving them into a vehicle, handcuffed. Over the noise, an observer tries to ask the person being detained for their name and who they want contacted. Sometimes a detainee’s phone, keys, or a bag make it into an observer’s hands. Everyone is filming. The press is taking photos.

Soon the agents are back in their vehicles. They pull risky maneuvers to move through the crowd and speed off. No more than six or seven minutes have elapsed, and another neighbor has been kidnapped. Observers are left to deal with the wreckage: tow an abandoned car, contact family, sometimes collect children. There are lawyers on call, local tow companies offering free services, mutual aid groups to support families after an abduction. Some observers stay behind to do this kind of coordination, and some get back in their cars or on their bikes and speed off again. If enough people get there fast enough, ICE might back off next time. At a minimum, their cruelty can’t go unchallenged.

I’m in my kitchen typing out “do swim goggles protect you from tear gas.” The AI search response that I’ve failed to disable tells me they can “help significantly.” I laugh at this ridiculous tableau. The local ACE Hardware store posted on Facebook that they’ve stocked up on respirators and safety goggles. What I once considered hardcore riot gear is now essential for leaving the house.

I live near the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Lake Street, two major South Minneapolis thoroughfares that mark the northwest corner of the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. My house is a mile north of where George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020 and even closer to where Renee Good was murdered by ICE agent Jonathan Ross this month. Since the Department of Homeland Security initiated “Operation Metro Surge” in December, there have been at least half a dozen abductions that I know of on or around my block. A nearby house of recently arrived Ecuadorians used to be home to sixteen adults and six children. Six weeks into the federal invasion, only eight adults remain.

Citywide, hundreds of people are being abducted from their homes and separated from their families. Citizens are racially profiled and asked for papers. Exact numbers on detainees are unreliable, but the number of federal agents is roughly three thousand. These numbers are similar in scale to ICE operations in other cities across the US, including LA and Chicago, but what’s new in Minneapolis are the extreme tactics that federal agents are using to repress organized resistance. The stories circulating online and by word of mouth are harrowing: federal agents surrounding observer cars to trap them, then smashing car windows and dragging observers out; agents spraying mace six inches from someone’s face or spraying mace into intake vents so that the inside of cars are immediately flooded; agents suddenly braking at seventy miles per hour on the freeway and forcing tailing vehicles to swerve; agents throwing observers on the ground, punching observers in the face, agents taking observers on aimless rides around the city while taunting them with racial or sexual epithets; agents holding observers at the federal detention building for hours without access to phone calls or lawyers. (This is merely how ICE terrorizes US citizens.)

What also feels new is the frequent candor with which ICE agents are displaying hateful ideology. Two days after Good was murdered, DHS overtly referenced a Neo-Nazi anthem in a nationwide recruitment post. Agents seem to feel empowered to say new kinds of chilling things out loud. One told an observer: “Stop following us, that’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.” (He was referring to Good.) A friend of mine was sexually harassed by an ICE agent, who called them “too pretty” to stay locked up while in detention. Another was shoved to the ground and asked, “Do you like the dirt, queer?” Sometimes the behavior is simply bizarre. After an attempted abduction left a couple dozen observers standing on a neighborhood street, one ICE vehicle circled the block, broadcasting a looped audio recording of a woman screaming.

In these moments the whole situation can seem ridiculous. The professional kidnappers step out of their flashy American cars with their special outfits on. They wave their little mace guns at us, but we’re not scared—we have oversized ski goggles! A particularly comic element at play is that we’re in the middle of another winter with wild variations in temperature, meaning that Minneapolis streets are covered in thick sheets of ice. There are some heartwarming videos of agents falling down (“ICE on ice!”) but we slip too, running towards or away from them. It can feel kind of slapstick, until you remember that they will destroy someone’s life today, and that they can kill you.

A black gloved hand reaches out of the Wagoneer window and begins to give a princess wave to us, then the peace sign, then a thumbs up. They’re mocking us. The agents stop their vehicle suddenly but Amy brakes in time. Luckily, so do we. ICE has been using “brake-checks” as pretense for detaining observers. Another observer car pulls up and my city council member steps out. He strides up to the Wagoneer, blowing his whistle. (Absolutely everyone is confronting ICE—I’ve encountered my old boss from the local cafe scuffling with agents, too.) Someone on the street starts filming and the bicyclist we know in the chat as “small fry” shouts at the agents to get out of Minneapolis. We’re honking. The Wagoneer idles for a few minutes and then takes off towards the freeway. We follow until they’re on the exit ramp. It feels good to watch them leave the neighborhood, but I worry about where they’re headed next. We drive towards home and come across another two vehicles with observers tailing behind. Lake Street, a major corridor of immigrant businesses in the neighborhood, has been crawling with ICE vehicles every morning this week.

Powderhorn Park is a middle-class neighborhood known for its May Day parade, replete with larger-than-life puppets and steampunk Mad Max vehicles. Artists and families live here, and young queer people, and many immigrants, most arriving from Ecuador in recent years. The past few summers, the block south of me has become impassable every evening as hundreds of my Spanish-speaking neighbors use the park for massive volleyball tournaments. Food vendors set up tables and families bring lawn chairs to watch the games. Last year, two women sold grilled chicken on the corner closest to me. My neighbor’s lawn became a kind of informal restaurant, where customers would sit at the warping picnic table and eat. I bought their chicken a few times, and it was awesome.

A week into the invasion my neighbor with the picnic table called to ask if I was available to come with one of the two vendors to an immigration appointment. The woman had been contacted by USCIS that morning and was told to come in at 3 o’clock that same afternoon. She was worried she could be detained on the spot and had a newborn with her. Several neighbors gathered to arrange a ride, but in the end she only wanted a lawyer and translator to attend with her. I heard later that at the appointment she announced she wanted to self-deport, trading a planned exit for the fear of being taken at random. Her sister, the other vendor, is still here. The Saturday after Good’s murder, she and I sit with a small group of volunteers gathered to talk about how to improve rideshare coordination over WhatsApp. She tells us in Spanish that migrants can’t use corporate rideshare services because there have been reports of Uber drivers taking people directly to ICE. Of the more than two hundred people in the rideshare text thread, half are citizens offering rides and half are requesting. “I like being in this group because I’m meeting so many neighbors I would not have met otherwise,” someone says at the meeting. “I hope we stay connected after this is all over.”

Powderhorn is the same park where, in June 2020, a majority of Minneapolis City Council members stood on stage and announced their support for defunding the Minneapolis Police Department. It’s also where more than 10,000 people gathered to protest ICE the weekend after Renee Good was shot. Minneapolis learned a lot from the George Floyd protests and it shows. Well before Kristi Noem announced DHS operations in Minnesota, the neighborhood got ready. It started with rapid response preparation in the park’s recreation center and legal observer trainings at a church. Then it was block-by-block meetings. Small networks that formed in 2020 were reactivated to distribute 3D-printed whistles and practice scenarios for confronting agents. When ICE deployed in December, Signal threads for local alerts quickly surpassed the thousand-user limit, and an extensive mutual aid ecosystem of grocery runs and rideshares emerged overnight. After Good’s murder and Noem’s announcement that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would triple, everyone I know cancelled their social plans. Lots of people called off work.

What we’re doing now is this: The trainings have evolved into street medic workshops on protecting yourself from chemical weapons and lessons on digital security; there’s a meet-up to sew reinforced umbrellas as shields from mace and a collection spot for barricade materials. And this is what it’s like: Sometimes you’re chasing ICE off your street, maybe you’re buying groceries for a family, but a lot of the time you’re on your phone. Behind every actionable piece of organizing are hours spent coordinating in Signal threads, calling to check up on someone, scrolling live feeds. At night, over dinner, it’s all anyone can talk about. Did you hear? Did you see that post? Did you read in the thread?

I moved to Minneapolis in 2019 because I was looking for a mid-sized city where rents were still relatively cheap. I knew it was a place where people could afford to be punks and experimental artists and career anarchists. I also knew it was a city with “good politics,” whatever that meant to me at the time. The first summer I lived here, my new friends were going to northern Minnesota on the weekends to support Indigenous resistance camps opposing construction of the Line 3 tar sands pipeline. During Covid, they were standing in parking lots, distributing food and diapers, or defending homeless encampments from police. The uprising following George Floyd’s murder brought everyone out to the streets each night for a week. It’s simply true, I learned, that when you only work part-time, when your main expense is a $400-a-month room in your punk house, you have time to organize. From anarchist info shops to nonprofit worker centers, from the founding of the American Indian Movement in 1968 to the first formations of Anti-Racist Action in the 1980s, grassroots organizing undergirds the culture of the city in a unique way.

Trump officials have made it clear that Operation Metro Surge is as much about seizing migrants from their homes as it is about repression of dissent to fascism. But they seem confused about how exactly the dissent works, and about where it’s coming from. Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary of DHS, lambasted Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, governor Tim Walz, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison—all varyingly pro-cop centrist liberals—for their non-compliance with federal operations on X. “Sanctuary politicians like Ellison are the EXACT reason that DHS surged to Minnesota in the first place,” she wrote. Did she think the attorney general was out in the streets, throwing snowballs with his constituents?

One tactic of fascism is to shift the scales of political alignment: centrists become stalwarts of the radical left; moms become “domestic terrorists.” Everyone with a whistle becomes antifa. And actually, that last part is correct—or at least it should be. A general strike has been called for Friday, January 23. With luck, thousands of Minnesotans will join in on what many further left are already doing: stopping business as usual and withdrawing their consent from fascism. Among many things I hope for, I want to see volleyball games in the park again this summer.",https://www.nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G-cR9YaXYAAlIzr-e1768686637747.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:13.660095

A federal judge in Minneapolis cited the episodes in an unusually detailed ruling on Friday that found a pattern of misconduct by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and ordered them and other immigration agents to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city.

In some ways, legal experts said, the judge’s order was fairly mundane because it merely ordered the federal agents to follow established constitutional law, permitting peaceful protests.

In other ways, it stood out.

“Extraordinary,” Michele Goodwin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said of the decision. The judge, she said, reviewed dozens of witness declarations and video evidence and found conduct “alarming enough, dangerous enough that the court has imposed a preliminary injunction.”

Protesters and state officials have for weeks been calling on the federal government to withdraw its immigration agents from Minneapolis, a movement that has only intensified since Renee Good was shot and killed on Jan. 7 by Jonathan Ross, an ICE officer.

In late December, the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of several protesters, filed a complaint against the federal government and its agents seeking to protect the protesters’ rights to speech, assembly and unlawful search and seizure.

The court order was based on earlier interactions that immigration agents had with protesters that did not gain as much attention as the killing of Ms. Good. The accounts described in the order were submitted to the court from declarations and video submissions from both parties.

Ms. Goodwin was one of several legal scholars and criminal justice experts who said the conduct of ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge, the government’s name for its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, evoked the attacks by police officers in Birmingham, Ala., on civil rights protesters in 1963.

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, also noted the similarities. “I think about the civil rights movement in the South and how Southern law enforcement reacted with hoses, dogs and lynchings,” he said.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, called the judge’s findings “ridiculous” on Sunday in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation and then blamed the protesters.

“We only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe,” she said, adding that the judge’s order will not change the agency’s operations on the ground. “It’s basically telling us to do what we’ve already been doing,” she said.

Her agency was expected to appeal the ruling.

The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges across the country, including in California, Illinois and Washington, D.C., where civil and immigrant rights organizations have sought to curb the tactics of federal agents.

In Illinois, where immigration agents massed for several weeks last year, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction that placed several limits on how agents could use force and interact with protesters. An appellate court later blocked that ruling, calling it too broad and too prescriptive.

The legal moves have come as the Trump administration pursues its deportation agenda, a cornerstone of the campaign that helped get Mr. Trump elected to a second term. For many, including in Minnesota, the immigration crackdown is the welcome fulfillment of that promise and should not be impeded by protesters.

The 83-page ruling found that “the record adequately illustrates that the defendants have made, and will continue to make, a common practice of conduct that chills observers’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights.”

Judge Katherine Menendez, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota by President Joseph R. Biden, said that neither party requested an evidentiary hearing, even though the court made that available.

She also stated that she gave “substantial weight” to the sworn statements from the plaintiffs and noted that immigration agents involved in the interactions with protesters did not provide sworn declarations.

Rather, the defense depended on testimony from David Easterwood, who directs the Minneapolis field office for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. Mr. Easterwood said he was not present at the encounters, but rather relied on “personal knowledge, reasonable inquiry and information made available to me.” Judge Menendez said because of that, she gave “considerably less weight” to the testimony of Mr. Easterwood.

In one episode described in the order, Judge Menendez concluded that federal agents likely were “simply fed up with the protesters generally” when they decided to violently arrest a man who was involved in peaceful activity.

“‘Let’s get this guy,’ one of the agents said, before they grabbed Abdikadir Noor, and threw him to the ground,” the ruling said.

While ICE contended in court papers that Mr. Noor was leading an agitated crowd of protesters as agents attempted to make an arrest, videos showed that he had pushed another protester away from the officers and held his arm up to urge other protesters to stay back, the court ruling said.

He was detained by ICE agents, taken to a federal building, shackled and put in a cell, and later released, according to the decision.

Ms. Tincher woke to learn that ICE agents had arrived in her Near North neighborhood in Minneapolis. She drove to a nearby home that was surrounded by agents to find out what was happening.

Standing about six feet from agents who had encircled the home, she said, she heard officers say, “Get back,” and “Take her down.”

Within about 15 seconds, she said, several agents had grabbed her and pulled her to the ground, then handcuffed her while she was face down in the snow. Witnesses said she did not physically resist agents or taunt or threaten them.

ICE agents took Ms. Tincher to the federal building where they removed some of her clothes, cut off her wedding ring, and shackled her. Before releasing her, they told her she would be charged with obstructing a federal officer. She was never charged.

In court papers, Mr. Easterwood said that Ms. Tincher had attempted to cross into the perimeter of the house and tried to push an ICE officer out of the way.

But Judge Menendez disagreed.

She also cited a number of incidents of ICE agents “gratuitously deploying chemical irritants at observers and protesters.”

Alan Crenshaw, 35, a Minneapolis resident involved in the protests, said he entered a restaurant and witnessed two agents “violently slamming a young Black man against the wall” even though the man was yelling in pain and telling them he was a U.S. citizen.

Outside, he said, he saw the agents push the young man into the snow for no apparent reason, handcuff him and place him in a car.

As a crowd gathered, Mr. Crenshaw said multiple people were being pepper sprayed with no warning. Agents drove slowly past, opened the car door and sprayed a bystander on the side of the road. Then, another ICE car without lights drove past and sprayed Mr. Crenshaw right in the face.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:21.745769

Whether it concerns visa status or Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, the constitutionality of recent federal action is being highly contested across the country.

In light of this national discourse, a crowd of around 80 students, community members and professors gathered at SIU Simmons Law School on Wednesday, Jan. 14 for a lecture regarding ICE, immigration and new policies under the Trump administration.

Ohio State University’s César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández presented a lecture titled “Immigration Law in Turbulent Times” in which he describes recent events involving immigration through a legal lens. His lecture highlighted the increase in ICE raids across the country, clashes between civilians and agents that have led to shootings — like the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month — lawsuits, mass protests, the recent addition of 75 new countries to the U.S. visa ban list and the overall confusion concerning the legality of federal deportation practices.

Hernández’s teaching and writing details the intersectionality of criminal and immigration law and his lecture at SIU focused on the constantly evolving legal landscape that surrounds immigration enforcement techniques.

Attendees were able to speak with Hernández beforehand and ask questions after his lecture.

In his lecture, Hernández spoke about Trump’s campaign, and how he specifically pledged to evoke a deportation operation similar to President Eisenhower’s 1954 military-style campaign aimed at ending undocumented immigration by deporting hundreds of thousands of Mexicans through mass raids and arrests throughout southwestern America.

Hernández detailed the non-fatal shooting of Marimar Martinez, a Chicago woman whose SUV allegedly struck an ICE agent’s vehicle in October of 2025, after which the agent fired five shots, striking Martinez multiple times. Martinez’s vehicle was “boxed in” by ICE vehicles during the time of the shooting, and is among many of the contentious incidents in which ICE agents have used lethal force while conducting raids.

“The head of the FBI called her (Martinez), a domestic terrorist,” Hernández said.

She was later charged with assaulting and impeding federal officers, but the government’s account was challenged with conflicting evidence, including body-camera footage and text messages from an agent. Federal prosecutors then dismissed these charges citing prejudice, which means the case cannot be reopened because of a weak or flawed case.

Hernández then spoke about the fatal shooting of Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in January 2026 while in her vehicle as she engaged with agents during a neighborhood raid in Minneapolis.

“Good did not open the door. She did not exit the car. She continued driving it. First backwards, then forwards, then to the right. Then an agent, phone in one hand, shot her with a gun that he held in the other.” Hernández said. “The script repeats: Good is dead, and high level government officials say she is a domestic terrorist.”

Hernández also talked about the role that court case Terry v. Ohio plays during ICE raids. The 1968 Supreme Court ruling found it constitutional for police to “stop and frisk” without probable cause if they have reasonable suspicion that someone was involved in a crime.

Hernández said that Terry v. Ohio ties directly into a “turbulent time” on the west coast, with hundreds of ICE agents in the Los Angeles area. A district court in California recently responded to a lawsuit, Vasquez v. Noem (2025), that was brought by a group of people who were stopped and questioned by ICE agents. The plaintiffs believe they were racially profiled.

Hernández explained that the lawsuit, if successful, would prohibit ICE from racially profiling based on skin color, native language, accents, location or work/profession. A federal judge from California then agreed and issued an order restricting these tactics of profiling because it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court later paused the judge’s ruling, allowing ICE to continue those tactics.

Hernández noted that Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court justice, is of the opinion that immigrants “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.”

Kavanaugh was appointed in 2018, and has since written multiple court opinions about whether or not factors like race and ethnicity could be considered in immigration stops under the Fourth Amendment.

“How would an agent know that someone does not speak much English? How would an agent go about racially or ethnically categorizing a person?” Hernández asked, referring to Kavanaugh’s remarks regarding the Supreme Court’s hearing of Noem v. Vasquez. “Kavanaugh did not explain how agents were supposed to figure out those factors.”

Hernández explained that he and a friend, “just two brown-skin Latinos speaking Spanish” were having coffee.

“If we said one word to each other in English, it is one more than I can recall. If an immigration agent happened to be nearby, would they hear my conversation, not in English, and then decide that it must be because I cannot speak English?” Hernández asked. “What type of work would they decide I do? Would they assume that I am a tenured, full professor who holds an endowed chair at one of the country’s premier public universities?”

Hernández also spoke about the contingency surrounding the 14th Amendment, which states that people born of naturalized citizenship in the U.S. are citizens of the U.S. and that no state can enforce a law that can abridge the privileges and immunities of citizenship. Upon Trump’s second term, he challenged the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and what it means to be a “natural-born citizen” through an executive order. Trump argues that birthright citizenship should not automatically apply to children born to undocumented immigrants or parents without permanent legal status.

Hernández said that if this case is constitutionalized, “It will leave many of us without the U.S. citizenship we thought was woven into our legal DNA.”

In September 2025, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case. The court will likely not have a decision until mid-2026.

He closed his lecture with sobering remarks.

“We struggle to agree about whether what we see is real,” Hernández said. “We struggle to agree on whether the days are dominated by light or by darkness. We struggle to agree on whether the political storm in which we find ourselves is one of rejuvenation or one of decay.”

Hernández is currently the Gregory H. Williams Chair of Civil Rights and Liberties at Ohio State. Hernández has earned recognition as one of the top 10 most cited immigration law scholars in the U.S. Among being a scholar and author, Hernández is a former member of the ABA Commission on Immigration.

Simmons Law School Dean Hannah Brenner Johnson explained the importance of these lectures and continued conversations. She said the lecture was created in honor of the school’s founding dean, Hiram Lesar, whose work revolved around civil rights and public policy.

“I think at this particular point in our nation’s history, immigration is a very, very hot-button issue. So, it was very timely to bring a scholar in to talk about some of the constitutional issues that have arisen, and to also bring humanity to the problem as well,” Johnson said.

Attendee Sheila Simon, former lieutenant governor of Illinois and Simmons Law School professor, offered her perspective on Hernández’s lecture in an interview with the DE.

“I think it’s really important for them (law students) to hear the importance of conversation and the continued dialogue, and valuing the rule of law as a way to prevent violence,” Simon said.

A mob of anti-ICE agitators stormed a church Sunday in St. Paul, Minnesota, interrupting a worship service after protesters claimed a pastor inside was affiliated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Video shows agitators chanting ""Justice for Renee Good"" inside the sanctuary at Cities Church as the service began, raising concerns among law enforcement and religious leaders about protesters targeting houses of worship amid escalating anti-ICE demonstrations across the Twin Cities.

The person filming then described the disruption as a ""clandestine mission"" and claimed agitators had just learned one of the pastors at the church was connected to ICE.

Frey has defended the protests, pushing back on federal officials who have described the demonstrations as dangerous or lawless and rejecting claims that state and local leaders are responsible for fueling unrest.

Cardenas managed Cardenas General Merchandise, which is located near the intersection of South Ware Road and Military Highway in McAllen.
Depositions had been scheduled for 10 a.m. and the government wanted to prohibit Quintero’s attorney from mentioning ICE, masks, guns or people yelling and screaming during the raids.
In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.","McALLEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — In October, agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a major operation in McAllen.

The agents — wearing masks and carrying guns — raided five used-clothes warehouses, arrested more than 20 people and seized $176,000.

Three months later, as the cases head to trial, prosecutors want to ban any mention of ICE, masks or guns from the courtroom.

“The concern is that all this media attention surrounding these ICE shootings and ICE raids and things, they really strike an emotional chord with people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Lyles said during a hearing on Monday. “And the concern is that the jury would be triggered by use of ‘ICE,’ ‘masks,’ ‘firearms,’ and ‘yelling and screaming,’ and decide the case based on their emotions and ignore the court’s instructions to weigh the evidence.”

Jurors should focus on the facts, Lyles said, not how ICE conducted the raids.

Lyles summarized the government’s argument during a hearing in the case against Pedro Quintero Cardenas, 29, of Mission.

Cardenas managed Cardenas General Merchandise, which is located near the intersection of South Ware Road and Military Highway in McAllen.

Cardenas General Merchandise purchased used clothing from Goodwill locations in Ohio and Maine, according to documents filed in an unrelated lawsuit. The clothing is typically sold to customers in Mexico.

Agents raided Cardenas General Merchandise and detained 23 people on Oct. 2.

Twelve had tourist visas, according to the criminal complaint against Cardenas. Another 11 had no legal status in the United States.

“He admitted to hiring visa holders and undocumented individuals,” Mirna Garcia, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE, testified during a hearing in October. “He also admitted to paying them in cash and not withholding taxes or Social Security from their paychecks.”

People with tourist visas can’t work in the United States.

“The business itself was an illegal enterprise,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Cook Profit said during the October hearing, “because it was employing these illegal individuals who had no status to work in the United States.”

A grand jury indicted Quintero on eight charges, including participating in a conspiracy to encourage non-citizens to illegally enter or reside in the United States. He pleaded not guilty.

Quintero returned to court Monday.

Depositions had been scheduled for 10 a.m. and the government wanted to prohibit Quintero’s attorney from mentioning ICE, masks, guns or people yelling and screaming during the raids.

“The jury has a right to know all the details — all the facts — of the case,” attorney Edelmiro Arredondo III, who represents Quintero, told a judge.

Arredondo said the details would provide “a more colorful picture” for the jury.

“The government’s position is that allowing all this ‘color’ that defense counsel wants into the depositions will seriously risk jury nullification,” Lyles said.

Mentions of ICE, masks or guns are “completely irrelevant,” Lyles said, to whether Quintero encouraged non-citizens to enter or reside in the United States.

“It’s clear, I think, that use of those words risks inflaming the jury, creating undue prejudice and jury nullification,” Lyles said.

It wasn’t the first time Lyles had made that argument.

In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.

Attorneys largely avoided both topics. After more than six hours of deliberation, jurors found the man guilty.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Juan F. Alanis, who presided over the hearing on Monday, granted the government’s motion to prohibit “argument or evidence designed to elicit jury nullification,” but refused to ban any mention of ICE, masks, guns or yelling and screaming.

“If they’re with ICE, that’s a factual statement,” Alanis said. “If they had masks on, that’s a factual statement. If they had their firearms in use, that’s a factual statement.”

Alanis noted that he wasn’t present when agents executed the search warrants and didn’t know what, exactly, happened.

“If, for whatever reason, they felt a need — they had to raise their voice to get control of the situation, that may be just a factual statement,” Alanis said. “I don’t know.”

The ruling is limited to depositions in the case against Quintero. Prosecutors remain free to make a similar request before trial.

“I understand the government’s concern,” Alanis said. “The defense is on notice: If they decide to grandstand or go beyond just asking the straightforward questions, at a later date a judge may disallow that information being played before a jury.”

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.
Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.
This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.
The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.","The Legal Ombudsman (LeO) has been ordered to reconsider part of its findings of poor service by a direct access barrister after it overlooked a key piece of evidence.

However, Marcus Pilgerstorfer KC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, dismissed all of Md Abu Sufian’s other challenges to LeO’s decision.

Aside from the mistake of fact, he found neither procedural faults in the way LeO dealt with the case nor unreasonableness or irrationality in its decision making.

Mr Sufian, head of 160 Fleet Street Chambers in London, for ‘Client N’ on several pieces of immigration work, including two oral permission hearings in judicial review proceedings, preparing an appeal to the Court of Appeal – which was conceded before the hearing and led to an order of £16,350 in costs in favour of his client – and a successful challenge to directions to remove the client from the country, again with costs.

Client N complained to Mr Sufian’s chambers about various matters, including that the Court of Appeal costs were paid directly to the barrister. These were rejected, with the chambers saying Client N authorised payment of the costs direct to him.

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.

She found Client N had agreed that Mr Sufian could keep the Court of Appeal costs but went on to decide he failed to provide adequate costs information throughout his instruction, backdated one client-care letter, and failed to inform her of the costs award.

In deciding remedy, Ms Logue found that Mr Sufian received £27,210.50 but that Client N only reasonably expected to pay £17,298 based on the costs information provided.

However, if she ordered him to refund the difference of £9,912.50, that would have meant Mr Sufian receiving only 39% of the overall costs bill of £44,598. Given that the quality of the actual legal work was good, this would be unfair, Ms Logue decided.

Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.

The barrister brought a judicial review on multiple grounds and the only successful element was over one piece of work for which LeO said he did not provide costs information when in fact the client-care letter had expressly quoted a fee of £7,500.

LeO accepted that the evidence pack Ms Logue had used was missing the relevant page and that this amounted to a mistake of existing fact.

This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.

Further, it affected the decision on remedy. Under Ms Logue’s original methodology, adding £7,500 to the fees Client N reasonably expected to pay would have meant Mr Sufian was only overpaid by £2,412.50. Given that, she may well have stuck with that approach.

The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.",https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Marcus-Pilgerstorfer-KC.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:10.010092

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include: The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare.","Did you know that Australia has no national human rights framework? Australia has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since 1948, but this has never been adopted into Australian law.

There are state and territory-based human rights charters in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, with legislation introduced in NSW in October 2025. However, these do not bind our federal government and are not necessarily very effective in enforcing human rights. Governments remain able to have the final say without oversight on whether a law or decision will infringe on a person or group’s human rights.

The national campaign for a Human Rights Act is well underway, and the ANMF has signed onto this campaign as a supporter. So, what would a national Human Rights Act look like, and how would it operate?

History of the campaign

There have been several attempts to launch a Human Rights Act in previous decades, the most recent of which occurred during the Rudd government. The concept of enshrining human rights on a national level appears inherently good, but the campaign has historically failed due to a lack of political will. After all, a large part of a Human Rights Act would be to require governments to consider human rights when making laws and decisions.

What will a Human Rights Act do?

Put simply, a Human Rights Act would do three core things:

Hold our governments accountable.

Consolidate and promote our national values of equality and non-discrimination.

Align our laws with our international obligations and provide legal clarity.

In doing these three things, a Human Rights Act would allow everyone in Australia to look to a set of rights that encapsulates our values and provides an understanding of what people can and cannot do, consistent with a rights-based framework.

Given the federal government makes laws and decisions in relation to key areas like immigration, childcare, aged care, welfare, taxation, and some aspects of health and housing, it is important they are bound by a human rights framework. A Human Rights Act would make sure the government considers our human rights and acts without breaching them. Key examples where a human rights framework would have impacted and potentially prevented poor decision-making include the Robodebt crisis or the use of indefinite immigration detention.

Finally, a Human Rights Act would enable the enforcement of our rights by the courts and prosecutions when they are breached. Individuals or groups would have a clear framework by which they can assess whether their rights have been breached and strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure those breaches do not continue.

How will a Human Rights Act impact ANMF members and patients?

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include:

The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare. It also ensures the underlying determinants of health including environment and work facilitate a person’s good health. This right in particular would have huge impacts for our members and patients across the health system, ensuring healthcare is delivered in a safe environment and at a high quality by appropriately qualified people.

The right to an adequate standard of living: this right would guide housing policy to ensure it is available and affordable, particularly for public and social housing. It would also impact welfare policy to ensure that our society’s most vulnerable are able to have dignity in their lives.

The right to privacy: in an increasingly digitised world, this right would ensure everyone has their privacy and data protected.

Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.
In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.
In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car.
Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’” After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital.","Newly obtained videos of the moments right after the Wednesday incident in which an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis appear to contradict at least some of ICE’s claims about events leading up to the shooting.

In a statement Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said the agent targeted, chased and then shot the man in self-defense as the agent was being “ambushed” by three people. But accounts in the videos contradict the identity of the person DHS says federal agents chased, and the details of the shooting itself.

According to DHS, federal agents were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” when, they say, Julio Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” one of its officers. During the struggle, DHS said in the statement, two additional people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer using a snow shovel and a broom handle.

According to DHS, Sosa-Celis “got loose” and began striking an agent “with a shovel or broom stick.” DHS says the agent then “fired a defensive shot,” which hit Sosa-Celis in the leg.

The three people who allegedly assaulted the officer ran into the apartment building and barricaded themselves before agents arrested all three, DHS said.

But videos from Sosa-Celis’ family appear to tell a different story. One of them shows a video call made by Sosa-Celis’ partner and reviewed by CNN, frantically describing to family members what she says happened, according to Alicia Celis, the mother of Sosa-Celis, who spoke to CNN.

The call appears to contradict ICE’s claims in DHS’ Thursday statement. There, ICE said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving a vehicle that crashed, and Sosa-Celis who fled on foot before agents struggled with him on the ground.

In the call, Sosa-Celis’ partner seems to say the driver of the car was not Sosa-Celis, but Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna — another man ICE detained during the same raid.

“Julio arrived first. They were chasing Alfredo — he had to jump from his car,” Sosa-Celis’ partner says during the call. “He ran and they threw themselves on top of him. After, Julio threw open the door, and they shot.”

The incident marks the second time in a week an immigration agent shot someone while on the job, sparking heated clashes in Minnesota and prompting President Donald Trump to threaten to use the Insurrection Act. Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.

Sosa-Celis was taken to an ambulance and hospitalized; the city of Minneapolis confirmed he had non-life-threatening injuries. CNN has contacted city officials to determine whether he is still hospitalized.

In a statement to CNN on Saturday, DHS stood by its initial statement that the subject of the raid on Wednesday was Sosa-Celis and that he was driving the vehicle.

The family’s version of events, heard in a livestreamed Facebook video when family members frantically called 911 to ask for help, also differs from DHS’ statement.

In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.

“They were following my husband for about 30 minutes. They were trying to crash into him. He arrived at home and because we closed the door on them, they shot him!” a woman can be heard telling the dispatcher. It’s not clear who is speaking or whether Sosa-Celis is the person referred to as being followed.

Throughout the initial video, several family members can be heard pleading with the dispatcher for help.

“Where did they shoot your cousin?” a 911 dispatcher asks the family over the phone. “In the leg! The leg! Please help us! We have kids!” a man responds.

“We have a small child in the house!” one woman says in the background. “And if they shoot?” another woman asks.

“Do you know who shot them?” the dispatcher asks the group. “The ones from ICE! The ones from ICE!” a man replies.

The stream ends with the family continuing to speak with the dispatcher on the phone.

A different video obtained by CNN shows what was happening outside the home while the family waited inside.

In the video, agents are seen approaching the home and setting off a flash-bang. Smoke can be seen, and ramming sounds are heard as someone says, “They’re in! There’s more than a dozen of them.”

Mothers of detained men dispute DHS statement

Alicia Celis also told CNN she has spoken to her son only once, briefly, from the hospital after the shooting. Celis said she had not asked her son about ICE’s claim he attacked agents with a broom or shovel.

“(Julio) only called me to tell me that he is fine, for me not to worry, and for me to stay calm and not cry,” Celis said.

In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car. DHS also described the agent as “fearing for his life” when he fired the shot. But in an interview with CNN, Mabel Aljorna, the mother of Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, disputed both of those claims on the basis of her conversation with her son immediately after the shooting.

Aljorna said her son told her he was the one being pursued on foot by ICE, and that Sosa-Celis was already inside the home when the agent shot him — not outside, where ICE says the agent fired the shot.

“He told me, ‘Mom, ICE was chasing me. Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’”

After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital. In that video, he says there was a physical confrontation between him and agents before the shooting as he tried to help Aljorna get inside the home.

However, he also claims he was inside the house and the ICE agent was outside — and the two were separated by a closed door — when the agent shot him, while Sosa-Celis was locking the door and Aljorna was already inside.

“What happened was that ICE had been chasing my cousin from far way. He came over here, and he tried coming to the house,” Sosa-Celis said. “He got there and he was able to escape. We struggled with them. We were successful in helping my cousin get inside. And as I tried shutting the door, ICE shot me in the leg.”

“The shot that was fired happened when my cousin managed to escape, and he entered inside,” Sosa-Celis said on the livestream. “I closed the door. And as I was locking it, I heard the shot, and that’s when I realized I had been shot in the leg.”

CNN visited the home Friday. The front doorway was boarded up and there was no evidence to be found about the condition of the front door at the time of the shooting.

CNN has been unable to directly reach Sosa-Celis and Aljorna for comment.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256383698.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-18 19:57:53.573433

“Not only has he shut down the border, he has shut down legal immigration and taken away legal status from individuals who had it,” she added, noting that those whose status has lapsed can then face deportation.
Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.
While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.
Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison.","In his first year back in office, President Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration, launching the most visible enforcement effort seen in history while closing the door to many legal pathways for entering the U.S.

Trump promised to plug the border and crack down hard on those living in the country illegally, and under his tenure crossings have fallen to a historic low while the number of people kept in immigration detention centers has soared.

Whether Trump has fulfilled his promise to go after the worst of the worst when it comes to immigrants in the country illegally is in dispute. More than 70 percent of those held in immigration detention have no prior criminal record.

Separately, many of those targeted have legal status in the U.S., as the Trump administration pushes to end, pause or limit various ways to lawfully live in the country.

The crackdown may also be negatively impacting Trump’s polling numbers.

Polling shows Trump’s approval rating has slipped from 50 percent to 40 percent in the span of a year. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 57 percent of respondents said they did not approve of how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces immigration laws. And a poll from The Economist saw a surge in support for abolishing ICE, with 46 percent recently saying they wanted to scrap the agency, up from 27 percent in July.

Republicans described the year as a culmination of Trump’s most prominent campaign pledge.

“Our job is pretty basic. What did you tell the voters you were going to do when you ran for it? If you get elected, go do what you say. No one does that better than President Trump,” said Rep Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the president’s allies in Congress.

“He told us he could secure the border. He did it in like four months time.”

Democrats argue Trump’s actions have at times descended into unlawful territory.

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), who has introduced legislation to shift a number of immigration enforcement policies, said Trump’s actions “completely demeans and denigrates the American values that this country has lived, has relied on for 250 years.”

“The damage to the country is far greater than the actual policy or even the deportation results, because what he’s attacking are the very fundamental values that have been the bedrock of this country since its founding, which is that it’s the land of opportunity that was built by immigrants, has been a refuge for those who are suffering around the world,” he said.

A focus on immigrants with legal status

While Trump pledged to remove those in the country illegally, the president has taken a whirlwind of actions that instead target immigrants with legal status.

“The truth is that the Trump administration campaigned on immigration reform, but what we’ve seen and what he’s delivered goes well beyond what he said,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

“Not only has he shut down the border, he has shut down legal immigration and taken away legal status from individuals who had it,” she added, noting that those whose status has lapsed can then face deportation.

In his first year back on the job, Trump has ordered a re-review of the 200,000 refugees who had been admitted under the Biden administration, a group that undergoes some of the most rigorous vetting before arriving in the U.S.

And in the wake of the killing in November of a National Guard officer in Washington, D.C., Trump paused the processing of pending immigration petitions for people from 19 countries on the travel ban list, a group that grew significantly as the president expanded the ban to 39 countries. The move meant those seeking green cards or even set to naturalize were stuck in limbo, unable to advance their petitions.

In March, Trump said he would strip the parole status former President Biden gave to citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras, curtailing the two-year status and forcing roughly 530,000 people to leave the country.

Trump has also moved to scrap deportation protections for 12 of the 17 countries designated for so-called temporary protected status (TPS).

Meant to block deportation of citizens whose home countries are experiencing natural disasters or civil unrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeated the same refrain as it has ended the status country by country: “Temporary means temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in ending the TPS for Somalia.

Collectively, lifting TPS jeopardizes the status of more than 1 million people, and it’s one of the few issues that has sparked some pushback from within the GOP.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R), whose Florida district includes many people who came in on parole or were covered by TPS, said the process needs more “nuance” to account for those who had legitimate concerns in fleeing dictatorial regimes.

He blamed Biden for a poor process that is “creating a very difficult situation to actually solve this issue for folks who, by the way, are here and are good people, and they committed the original sin, right, [on immigration]. But then most Americans understand, [for] those people, we should have a process,” Diaz-Balart said.

The Trump administration has also revoked 8,000 student visas amid a pushback on people it says have espoused views counter to U.S. interests. The majority of those visas revoked appear to be for committing crimes while in the country, but at least 200 to 300 visas were revoked over alleged support for terrorism, a term the department used for some who have protested the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Beyond students and faculty, the State Department also rescinded permissions for five technology researchers focusing on disinformation the Trump team accused of targeting conservative speech.

Immigration advocates say the move is a clear infringement on free speech.

“One of the ways that they have used the immigration system to impact democratic norms is in the weaponization and targeting people for what is speech, using the system against people who dare say something that the administration disagrees with — not [speech] that is illegal by any means, just not something that they that they want to hear,” said Jorge Loweree, managing director at the American Immigration Council.

Trump has also sought to prevent new immigration to the U.S. through various moves.

In October the president set the lowest refugee cap in history, allowing just 7,500 refugees to come into the country in the coming year, down from the goal of 125,000 set under Biden. In addition, Trump has dictated that accepted refugees should primarily be white South Africans.

Beyond the initial travel ban, Trump announced last week he would also pause immigration visa processing for 75 countries, effectively blocking immigration from nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe.

Trump also suspended the green-card lottery, targeting the method the Brown University shooter used to arrive in the U.S., upending a program that allows up to 55,000 people a year to migrate.

Trump has opened up some new immigration pathways, but those options have been tied to hefty fees. He revamped the investor visa as a so-called Gold Card for those willing to pay $1 million. H-1B visas now also come with a $100,000 price tag.

Visible enforcement and growing detention

Trump has fundamentally changed the dynamic at the southern border as well as how immigration officials carry out enforcement across the country, part of a widely publicized campaign.

Data tracking crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border shows a nosedive from roughly 100,000 a month under the last few months of the Biden administration to an average of around 10,000 a month since Trump retook office.

Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.

“We’ve pretty much solved that problem,” Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), chair of the House Republican Conference, said of the border.

“So I think it’s been pretty doggone good. It’s been so doggone good that we don’t even talk about the border anymore. That is absolutely fantastic.”

Much of Trump’s focus has been on removing people already in the country as the president has sought to impose the largest mass deportation effort in history.

Rates of those held in immigration detention are also at their highest ever, with some 70,000 people currently locked up and facing deportation.

However, 73 percent of those currently held in detention have no criminal record. The data, compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, indicates that within the 28 percent who do have a criminal record, “many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.”

“‘Mass deportation’ isn’t possible with any kind of targeted approach,” Loweree said. “Their promises to deport people en masse by going after ‘criminals’ were a lie from the start.”

The tactics used by the administration to remove people have also come under significant scrutiny.

ICE officers, backed by other DHS officials, have been dispatched to carry out raids in left-leaning cities across the country. Tracked by protesters and observers, city-by-city footage has emerged of aggressive and at times violent enforcement.

ICE’s policies have particularly come under scrutiny since an officer shot and killed Renee Good on a Minneapolis street earlier this month. The administration argues the ICE officer feared for his life because Good, driving her car, was threatening him. City and state officials argue the ICE officer acted recklessly.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said those images have been a turning point for the public, referencing video of ICE officers cutting a woman’s seatbelt to drag her out of her car as well as the viral footage of Good’s death.

“The American people are changing their views on immigration, whereas immigration, maybe in the past, was seen as a negative thing, a bad thing, I think all polls show that that’s no longer the case,” he said. “And I think the American people are more empathetic about immigrants in the plight of immigrants, as they see with their very own eyes, what’s happening across the country.”

In the wake of Good’s death, the administration has largely doubled down, accusing her of acting as a domestic terrorist while noting attacks against ICE officers.

While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.

“ICE isn’t the problem. The problem is sanctuary politicians and the violent criminal illegal aliens they protect,” Noem recently wrote on social platform X.

“President Trump and this administration work to protect every single American and make sure that they can live in a safe community and can raise their kids without fear.”

Court battles on policy and with judges themselves

Many of Trump’s immigration moves have been paused or overturned by the courts, but the Trump administration has aggressively fought those orders and, in some cases, defied a judge’s directives.

The Trump administration faced a contempt of court inquiry after it sent more than 100 Venezuelan men to be imprisoned in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Numerous courts ruled Trump did not have the power to expel the men without giving them the chance to contest allegations of gang ties.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg determined the Trump team “secretly spirit[ed]” them away after his order to halt or turn around any flights. After Boasberg issued an additional ruling offering the Venezuelans a way to return to the U.S. to continue their court battles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they would not return, citing ongoing negotiations after toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison. Abrego Garcia, who was previously protected from being deported to his home country, was removed because of an administrative error. While numerous courts ordered the administration to attempt his return, it did not do so until it brought him back to face human trafficking charges relating to a 2022 traffic stop.

After lawmakers won a suit challenging a DHS policy seeking to block them from making unannounced visits to detention centers, Noem again tried to enforce the policy.

The Trump administration has also come under fire for interfering with the immigration court system, where migrants pursue asylum and other legal claims for remaining in the country. In some cases, prosecutors pushed to dismiss cases, only to end someone’s legal claim so an officer waiting outside the courtroom could arrest them and fast-track their deportation.

Goldman, who has sought to bar the practice, noted migrants who are pursuing a lawful pathway to immigration cannot be deported.

“The courthouse stuff is the betrayal of the promises of the campaign, when Donald Trump said that he would be focusing on going after the worst of the worst, citing murderers and rapists and sex traffickers and horrific violent criminals,” he told The Hill.

“To turn around and be so lazy and ineffective that they resort to just waiting for people who are following the requirements of immigration law, showing up for court appearances, showing up for their required check-ins, and instead of getting a benefit from doing things the right way, they’re getting smashed and detained and deported. And it’s such a sabotage and it’s so repulsive that rather than going after serious felons who should be deported they’re going after the people trying to do it the right way.”

Trump has faced roughly 150 major lawsuits challenging his immigration policies, and many of his moves remain tied up in court.

An effort by Trump to scrap birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are not American, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, is set to be weighed by the Supreme Court this spring.

He has also tried through numerous different policies and executive orders to end the legal right to asylum, effectively ending the pathway.

Many of Trump’s attempts at scrapping TPS have also been halted, in some cases because the administration failed to follow a process that requires offering detailed analysis of how country conditions have shifted.

But the Supreme Court has also repeatedly blocked lower court injunctions, allowing the Trump administration to continue to deport people to countries they are not from and to force those on parole to leave the country.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back on criticism of Trump, arguing he is using all the legal levers at his disposal to remove those not lawfully present in the U.S.

“He’s simply enforcing the law and a policy of enforcing the law, even one that did not prioritize criminal aliens, would still be enforcing the law,” he said.

“The fact that we had four years of not enforcing the law, flagrantly ignoring the intent of Congress and existing laws, is the four years of criminal conduct by Joe Biden.”

The 3 years ahead

Much of Trump’s immigration push is only just beginning.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump was given $45 billion in ICE funding to expand detention capacity to 135,000 at any given time.

Already the administration has struggled to secure facilities to house the migrants it wishes to detain, pushing them to work with states to line up more space. That includes so-called Alligator Alcatraz, a facility made of tents and chain link fences constructed in just days on an old airway strip in Florida.

Immigration advocates fear many who pose no real threat will continue to be exposed to harsh detention conditions.

“The fact that we’re spending billions of American taxpayer money on detaining individuals who are not criminals, who are not risks to our country, is outrageous,” said Dalal-Dheini, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Some in the GOP are hopeful that the trickle of migrants will mean the party will make good on its promise to review immigration reform once the border is secure.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), a former federal prosecutor, said that the focus should be on dangerous criminals and lamented that some industries, including those that need seasonal workers, have been hit hard by Trump’s enforcement.

“They always say, ‘Well, you gotta wait till the border’s secure to talk about immigration reform.’ So then that’s going to be the next debate,” he said.

“We got to look at some common sense solutions,” he said. “There are industries that really need the labor, and that’s the ag industry – I talk to them all the time, the construction, the restaurant [industries].”

He also noted areas like the tech sector also need workers.

Democrats hope to win back the House majority this fall and then have greater power to investigate the administration and curtail its immigration practices.

“This is a marathon. This is not a sprint. And so, yeah, people feel exhausted. I’m a fighter,” Espaillat said.

“I want to see how we could combat [Trump] and make sure that the right things are done.”

But others see Trump’s immigration moves as part of a broader militarization that aligns with decisions to flex U.S. might and trample on the rights of citizens and residents.

“I’m scared,” Goldman said when asked about possibilities under the rest of Trump’s term.

“It’s getting worse and worse and worse.”

Sebastian Ordonez, 58, was detained Thursday morning by ICE agents after leaving his Brooklyn apartment building because he lacked legal immigration status, according to Zhuang.

Ordonez is from Guatemala, but his family and close friends say he has no history of violent crime and has been part of the Brooklyn community for nearly 20 years.

Though his lawyer, Michael Musa-Obregon, believes his client is not legally in the country, he says “everybody is entitled to due process.”

“You cannot just randomly walk up to people, racially profile them, look at them like they’re other. And because of the color of their skin, and their mannerisms, or whatever other things you have as an agent in your brain, assume or presume that they are here illegally,” Obregon said.

“We have to stand up against this nonsense. Against this illegal act by our president,” Councilmember Susan Zhuang said. “We have to make sure everyone deserves due process, regardless of what legal status you have in this country.”

Solidarity follows Ordonez’s detention and the federal visa ban on 75 countries deemed likely to need public assistance in the U.S.

That omission added to speculation that the group may have a broader mandate to cover other conflicts and could even be aimed at creating a U.S.-dominated alternative to the United Nations Security Council.

A Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 endorsed Mr. Trump’s plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and welcomed the establishment of the board as a transitional administration that would set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment.

The enclave was devastated during the two years of war. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations. Many of the roughly 2 million residents are still living in tents among millions of tons of rubble.

The board’s charter was sent out with invitations to potential members over the weekend. A copy reviewed by The Times was verified by an official on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy. News of the $1 billion buy-in was previously reported by Bloomberg.

On Friday, the White House announced the board’s members would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Ajay Banga, the head of the World Bank.

Several countries said they had received invitations to join, including Argentina, Canada, Egypt and Turkey. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also been invited, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday.

Mr. Trump, who is to chair the board, said in a post on Truth Social last week that it will be “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though much about it remained unclear.

The charter appears to outline a much more ambitious role for the board than the one described in Mr. Trump’s plan for Gaza, published in October 2025, as well as the subsequent Security Council resolution.

The board’s mission, according to the charter, is to seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” and “to undertake peace-building functions in accordance with international law.”

The preamble emphasizes the need for what it calls “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body” and laments that “too many approaches to peace-building foster perpetual dependency and institutionalize crisis rather than leading people beyond it.”

According to the charter, the board is expected to meet for voting at least annually, and expenses are to be funded through voluntary contributions from member states or other sources. The charter does not elaborate on the peacekeeping efforts.

Along with the “Board of Peace,” the White House on Friday also outlined a “Gaza Executive Board” that would help liaise with a committee of Palestinian technocrats appointed to administer daily life in Gaza. The Gaza executive board includes Ali al-Thawadi, a senior Qatari official, and Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, among others.

The composition of the executive board prompted the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to issue a rare public protest against the Trump administration, saying it “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.”

While an Israeli businessman is on the executive board, Israeli government officials have not been named to it.

Miri Regev, an Israeli minister from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, told Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, on Saturday that Israel objected to participation of Qatar and Turkey, adding, “Prime Minister Netanyahu will do everything to change that decision.”

Relations between Israel and Turkey have oscillated over the decades, but since the war in Gaza, set off by Hamas’s attack against Israel in October 2023, they have deteriorated.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has downgraded ties with Israel, repeatedly compared Mr. Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and praised Hamas, while hosting its officials. Israeli officials are anxious about the prospect of Turkey gaining influence over Gaza’s future.

After Israel struck Qatar in September 2025 in a failed attempt to kill Hamas leaders meeting there, Mr. Netanyahu defended the action and lashed out against the country for giving what he called “safe haven” to the militant group, even as Qatar was trying to negotiate a cease-fire.

Qatari officials have said they hosted Hamas officials at the request of the U.S. government to facilitate channels of communication. Mr. Netanyahu has in the past relied on Qatar to send millions of dollars a month to Gaza, a policy that was intended to keep the peace but that also helped prop up Hamas’s rule over the territory.

Israel’s priority is seeing Gaza demilitarized. Hamas so far has not agreed to lay down its arms.

But after being pressed on a video that backed up the accounts provided to the court, she changed course. Protesters were to blame for the use of force, she said, adding that federal officers “only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating.”

The ruling on Friday by Judge Kate M. Menendez of the Federal District Court in Minnesota said that chemical agents had been used against protesters on at least four separate occasions and called the evidence of their use “uncontroverted.”

“Federal agents used chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected First Amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations,” the judge wrote in issuing her injunction, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In response to an inquiry about Ms. Noem’s comments, Tricia McLaughlin, a homeland security spokeswoman, did not comment on Ms. Noem’s initial denial and backtracking of immigration agents’ use of force. Instead, she emphasized that assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony, and accused protesters of tampering with agents’ vehicles and attacking officers with fireworks and automobiles.

Judge Menendez had dismissed the government’s claims that all use of pepper spray and other chemical irritants had happened after agents were “attacked,” finding that “protected conduct,” including protesting and observing the operations, had “motivated” the agents’ “adverse actions.”

The injunction issued last week stemmed from a lawsuit filed by activists who have protested the crackdown or observed the department’s operations in Minnesota. The suit was filed in December, before an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, prompting increased protests against the crackdown.

Ms. Good, 37, had partially blocked a roadway where agents were working and did not follow commands to get out of her S.U.V. As she began to drive away, an agent near the front of her car opened fire.

In addition to barring agents from using “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech, Judge Menendez also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

On Sunday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended the Justice Department’s decision to not investigate the agent who fatally shot Ms. Good, saying that doing so would be bowing to “pressure from the media” and politicians.

“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate, and that is not the case here,” Mr. Blanche said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody.”

The Justice Department has instead pushed to investigate Ms. Good’s widow, prompting several federal prosecutors in the state to resign.

Ms. Noem said during the interview that her department was conducting a separate, internal review of the agent’s actions, “following the exact same investigative and review process” that existed for years.

Even as critics of the government’s tactics say the operations, particularly in Minnesota, have indiscriminately swept up individuals based on racial and ethnic profiling, President Trump and members of his administration have insisted they are aimed at violent criminals.

Department of Homeland Security officials have repeatedly said that 70 percent of those detained in the administration’s immigration crackdown have been charged or convicted of a crime. That figure is roughly in line with a New York Times analysis of immigration arrests between the start of Mr. Trump’s term and Oct. 15, which found that 67 percent of those taken into custody had been at least charged with a crime of some kind.

But Ms. Noem on Sunday went a step further. “Every single individual” arrested by immigration agents had broken the law, she told “Face the Nation,” adding that 70 percent of those detained had either committed or been charged with violent crimes specifically.

Ms. McLaughlin, the department spokeswoman, did not respond directly to an inquiry about that statement, but repeated the department’s position that 70 percent of those arrested had been convicted or at least charged with a crime of some kind.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

Undeterred, Mr. Springsteen released a six-track EP that offered a mix of songs and his political remarks from the show in England. That project began with his statement that the United States was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”

Even so, the Pentagon last week put troops with two infantry battalions with the Army’s 11th Airborne Division on alert in case they ended up being called up, two Defense officials said.

“The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the commander in chief if called upon,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in an emailed statement, using the Trump administration’s preferred moniker for the department.

The Pentagon last week also quietly alerted 200 Texas National Guard troops to be ready to deploy to Minnesota in the event that Mr. Trump followed through with his threat. The Texas Guard soldiers have remained on standby since returning home from Chicago late last year.

But the deployment of troops from the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, would be a major escalation for Mr. Trump, who has already sent National Guard troops into a number of American cities.

The use of military force on domestic soil in the United States is rare, and it is usually reserved only for the most extreme situations. Active-duty forces are barred from domestic law enforcement unless the president invokes the Insurrection Act, which allows for the use of federal troops on U.S. soil.

The order putting the troops on notice to deploy was reported earlier by ABC News.

On Friday, a day after issuing his Insurrection Act threat, Mr. Trump appeared to walk back his comments. “I don’t think I need it right now,” he told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend in Florida.

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, urged Mr. Trump on Thursday to back off the heated rhetoric. “Let’s turn the temperature down,” the governor wrote on social media. “Stop this campaign of retribution.”

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into Mr. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, an escalation in the state-federal battle over the conduct of immigration agents in the city.

Mr. Trump was talked out of invoking the Insurrection Act in 2020 following the protests over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman. At the time, his defense secretary, attorney general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all advised him against sending active-duty troops into American cities to battle local citizens.

But Mr. Trump has a much more compliant Pentagon in his second term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has worked to amplify Mr. Trump’s directives and inclinations, rather than seek to restrain him.

One defense official said on Sunday that the Pentagon was aware that Mr. Trump had appeared to back away from his threat, but also said that Mr. Hegseth wanted to be prepared.

“RUN JULIA RUN!!!” Mr. Trump wrote, adding that “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement.”

The move is likely to create new tensions between Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans.

Mr. Trump called Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, on Friday and said he was likely to endorse Ms. Letlow, according to a person briefed on the conversation who was not authorized to discuss the private remarks.

Mr. Thune pushed him to support Mr. Cassidy, the person said, noting potential consequences for key votes in the future. The majority leader also noted that Mr. Trump was starting to push a major health care bill, which Mr. Cassidy would have jurisdiction over as chairman of the Senate’s health committee.

Mr. Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump in a social media post of his own on Saturday night: “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”

Ms. Letlow did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night, but on social media, she wrote that she was honored by the endorsement and made it clear that she was likely to announce a campaign.

“This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver,” she wrote.

The timing of Mr. Trump’s endorsement surprised Ms. Letlow, according to a colleague who spoke to her on Saturday night. The congresswoman had told people she would not enter the race without Mr. Trump’s official backing. But the move had long been in the works.

Mr. Trump first met with Ms. Letlow on March 5 of last year, the morning after the president’s address to a joint session of Congress. The Oval Office meeting included, among others, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; James Blair, a deputy chief of staff; and Representative Lance Gooden of Texas. Mr. Gooden helped arrange the meeting with Ms. Letlow.

In the meeting, Mr. Trump told Ms. Letlow that he would support her if she decided to challenge Mr. Cassidy, according to a person who was in the room and insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation. But he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.

Ms. Letlow, a former teacher whose political profile in her state grew when redistricting added Baton Rouge to her mostly rural constituency, is not known in the Capitol as an aggressive politician. She was hesitant to make any moves with only private assurances of Mr. Trump’s support.

Ms. Letlow spoke again with the president at the congressional picnic on June 12.

He again privately expressed his support, according to a person who heard their conversation. But he had still said nothing publicly. And she had still heard nothing more concrete from Mr. Trump or anyone in his political operation as of Dec. 11, when she announced her engagement at a holiday ball at the White House.

Big donors, meanwhile, were still giving money to Mr. Cassidy and telling Ms. Letlow that, until she formally declared that she was running, they would support him.

Ms. Letlow had almost resigned herself to staying out of the race. This month, she filmed two campaign commercials: one for a re-election campaign to the House, and one for a potential Senate race. As the February filing deadline approached, she did not know which one she would be using, according to a person briefed on her campaign plans.

But Ms. Letlow has been building quiet support from encouraging colleagues in the House, who said they expected her to jump in now and campaign aggressively.

Any endorsement of a candidate opposing a sitting senator is viewed as unwelcome by Senate Republicans, and it is a move the conference writ large has sought to avoid. That includes Mr. Cassidy, who voted in favor of Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., last year, despite expressing misgivings.

Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician and a proponent of vaccines, has remained a public skeptic of Mr. Kennedy.

But he has taken pains to repair relations with Mr. Trump. As of late Saturday, the post he had pinned atop his X account featured a photograph of a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president signed red hats.

“This is what a great working relationship looks like,” the October post from Mr. Cassidy said.

Mr. Trump’s endorsement of a potential Cassidy challenger comes days after the president frustrated Senate Republicans when he declared that five other G.O.P. senators should never be re-elected because of their opposition to him on military intervention in Venezuela. Among them was Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is seen as the party’s most vulnerable incumbent in 2026.

Mr. Trump has also been unwilling to throw his support behind Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who is facing a competitive primary race against two challengers, Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, and Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas.

Mr. Thune indicated to reporters last week that, despite his best efforts to persuade the president to back Mr. Cornyn, the three Texans were going to have to “duke it out in the primary.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump’s latest move.

Alex Latcham, the executive director of the main super PAC aligned with Senate Republicans, said in a statement on Saturday that his group’s mission was “to preserve and expand” the Republican Senate majority.

“Anything that distracts from our efforts to beat Democrats in November is unhelpful,” he said.

The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office held a town hall meeting to discuss public safety, community policing and the implementation of Texas Senate Bill 8.

The town hall meeting was held on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramirez Community Center, located at 106 Payton Rd. The Border Network for Human Rights co-hosted the event.

As KTSM previously reported, SB 8 mandates that every sheriff’s office in Texas counties with a population over 100,000 enter into a 287-G agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Under the agreement, trained local officers are allowed to carry out certain federal immigration functions.

Out of the three options given for the agreement, Ugarte said they will move forward with the Warrant Service Officer option: limits participation to serving administrative warrants or detainers on individuals already booked into the county jail.

This means that all warrant checks are done by federal officers, rather than local staff, to see if a detainer or immigration warrant exists for someone booked into the county jail. The bill officially went into effect this year on Jan. 1.

“This is not an option. This is not something that I wanted to do. But the Sheriff’s Office needs to do it because it’s a state law,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte spotlights the current political atmosphere, with ICE raids occurring in El Paso and across the nation, and emphasizes the importance of transparency.

“It’s very important because there’s a lot of confusion, there’s a lot of fear in our community because of what’s going on across the nation with federal agencies. So us, as local officials, it’s important to be transparent and talk to the community and have these forums if they have any questions so they can hear it directly from the Sheriff’s Office on what we are doing,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte also notes that, although the Sheriff’s Office is partnering with federal agencies, the priority of his office will remain focusing on crimes affecting the community.

“We work in collaboration with other agencies, but I want to remind the community that the focus of the Sheriff’s Office is dealing with crimes and issues that affect our community. That is the priority of the Sheriff’s Office,” he said.

He asks that if residents see ICE agents out in El Paso County, to not interfere with the investigations, including blocking roadways, assaulting the agents or damaging any property.

“If you do not agree with ICE and if you want to protest, you have a right to protest, but you need to protest from a distance. Keep your distance from the federal officers so they can do their job and do not interfere with any of their investigations,” Ugarte said.

Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights, said the topic most talked about was concerns about ICE and DHS raids that have been happening in El Paso.

“Outside of the 287-G agreements, the community is really concerned about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s raids that are taking place, about Homeland Security investigation raids that are being taken place, that there is no checks and balance when it comes to the federal organizations, that they are not identifying themselves, to community members that are coming in mass and they wanted to know if there was something that they should do or could do as community members to respond to these outgoing enforcement tactics that are taking place,” Singleton said.

She said that the Sheriff’s Office can assist in situations by confirming if the people investigating are federal agents. Once they have identified that they are agents, the Sheriff’s Office has to back off, as they do not have power over them.

“I believe the community should know that there’s always a way to get involved. So we ask that if you have questions, utilize our organization to be a resource. There are some tools that we have that we can help the community with. Most importantly, we want the community to know that we are here and we are here to assist and that we are each other’s keeper. And so we want you all to reach out to us if there are things that is needed from you,” Singleton said.",https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2026/01/EPCSO-BNHR-town-hall-meeting.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:17.244363

He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.
And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.
Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration.","Murphy spoke with POLITICO for an hour last week to reflect on his eight years in office, which concludes on Tuesday. He’s the first Democrat in decades to win two terms in the New Jersey governor’s office, and he steps down with his party on an even stronger footing than when he arrived in Trenton. That may have been hard to fathom when the former Goldman Sachs banker emerged seemingly out of nowhere a decade ago to succeed Republican Gov. Chris Christie.

But after years as a finance chair of the Democratic National Committee and U.S. ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama, Murphy leveraged his wealth and connections to clear a crowded primary field to become New Jersey’s 56th governor. He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.

Over the course of the conversation, Murphy toggled between national and local fights — from the investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which he called “breathtaking,” to his policy achievements at home, including the legalization of marijuana and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

But, like virtually everything else in American life, Trump dominated. And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.

During the pandemic, Murphy also had a working relationship with former White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom he praised for his efforts to provide ventilators and personal protective equipment. He said that “people forget” that “early on,” the administration was “pretty good on this.”

Murphy said he “expanded” his relationship with the president into “adjacent lanes,” like over the Portal North Bridge, an upgrade project important to the Northeast rail corridor that the Trump administration approved federal funding for later in 2020.

“When he ran the first time, he had a great line, he said, ‘I’m the only president, if I get elected, I’ll be the only president in history who understands what rebar is,’” Murphy said, referring to his discussions of the bridge with Trump. “So I would try to couch it in a lane that I thought would connect with him. So less flattery than, ‘Wait a minute, I know this is his lived experience,’ or knowing New Jersey well.”

There’s less of that this time around. Beyond having what he called a “cordial conversation” with the president after he was elected again, Murphy hasn’t spoken with Trump lately — “it’s not that I wouldn’t speak to him, but it’s just harder,” he said — but talked to chief of staff Susie Wiles a couple of weeks ago.

The difference between the two Trump administrations, Murphy continued, is that “they know what they’re doing” and “there are no, that I can find, powerful voices on the other side of some of the actions.”

“I’m not a big Mike Pompeo fan, but Pompeo is brilliant, number one in his class at West Point — you know, a serious person,” he said. “Or Gary Cohn, who I know well, used to work with at Goldman Sachs, was the national economic adviser, Jared himself, who I have enormous regard for. Those folks are not on the scene, and I feel like that’s the biggest — there’s no ballast.”

Even with a good relationship, New Jersey hasn’t been immune over the years to federal issues trickling down into the states. And there’s been plenty of disagreement between the governor and Trump, including on offshore wind, which the president has sought to kill: “We’ve fought like heck against the Trump team on offshore wind,” Murphy said. “I don’t think it makes any sense.”

New Jersey has also been bullish when it comes to legal action against the administration, with outgoing Attorney General Matt Platkin suing more than 40 times since Trump came back into office.

And Murphy himself hasn’t been completely untouched. Last year, Trump border czar Tom Homan said that Murphy could be prosecuted over a comment he made suggesting he was harboring an immigrant at his home, and former acting U.S. attorney Alina Habba said she was investigating him over immigration enforcement. Nothing came out of either of those threats, according to Murphy.

But the governor said that he found that Trump has not gone “out of his way” to impact the Garden State — and “for the most part” still isn’t.

That doesn’t mean he’s not worried.

“I wake up every day hoping that we don’t get hit in an innocent drive-by shooting [and] the shrapnel comes our direction,” he said. “You’re balancing. You can’t abandon your values. You can’t abandon communities or people who are being attacked for no good reason on the one hand. And on the other hand, you’re trying not to start World War III, and that’s hard.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Those fears have only been exacerbated in recent weeks and months. In Murphy’s view, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “will be awful for New Jersey.” The state, which is home to a prominent population of immigrants and a controversial immigrant detention center, is “not immune” to action from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said, adding that he’s worried a situation like the ICE agent who fatally shot a U.S. citizen in Minnesota could happen here.

Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. When it comes to talk about the U.S. seizing Greenland, he said that discussing “a land grab from an ally and a NATO partner of the United States” is “so beyond the pale.” And the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Powell “further undermines an institution that we’ve spent a couple of centuries building up,” Murphy said.

In just a couple of days, Murphy will hand the keys over to Sherrill, who had a blowout win in November to secure a third Democratic term in a row leading the state, a feat that has not been accomplished for six decades. Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration. In an interview last month, her campaign manager and soon-to-be chief of staff told POLITICO that they would be willing to work with the president if the “administration wants to get on the team” to support her efforts to make “life easier and more affordable for New Jerseyans.”

Trump endorsed Sherrill’s opponent Jack Ciattarelli — a change from previous New Jersey gubernatorial elections. He didn’t get involved in Ciattarelli’s 2021 race against Murphy, nor did he back Murphy’s opponent in 2017.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2F9f%2F184d59794edaa0bd46cbc33ea8df%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2244527993,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:30.119803

Businesses have been forced to close.” Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration.
Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.
Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.
Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled.","Nearly one year after returning to the White House with a promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in American history, masked immigration officers ripped a woman from her car as she tried to get to a doctor’s appointment in Minneapolis. On the other side of the country, a 21-year-old protester in Santa Ana, California, was recovering from eye surgery after an officer fired a riot-control weapon inches from his face.

They both came just days after an officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good.

The Trump administration’s promise to go after the “worst of the worst” in his nationwide campaign to rapidly deport tens of thousands of people has turned American cities into conflict zones patrolled by hundreds of masked and heavily armed officers.

Democratic officials warned for months that a surge of militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers would only stir up more unrest. They warned that the scenes of mass protests were by design, giving the president an opening to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy active-duty troops on Americans in cities run by his political enemies.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has reshaped the government to pursue an anti-immigration agenda across nearly every federal agency, with a mission to find, arrest and deport thousands of people, deter new arrivals and impose new restrictions on legal immigration that have repulsed humanitarian aid groups and civil rights advocates.

Thousands of people, most of whom have never been convicted of a crime, are now locked up in immigration detention centers, entering a byzantine legal process that the administration has pushed to make it virtually impossible to escape.

Federal officers, whose identities are largely kept secret and whose faces are covered, are routinely seen jumping out of cars and vans to round up immigrants and citizens alike, sometimes leaving their cars stranded in roadways or rolling down streets. They leave behind neighborhoods in shock and families in crisis, scrambling where to find members who often end up jailed hundreds of miles from home.

From Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, to Chicago, New York City, New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, footage and stories of violent arrests and volatile protests have emerged at a dizzying pace.

In Washington, D.C., last summer, Trump invoked a never-before-used authority to seize control of the city’s police department as deployed the National Guard and surged federal officers into the streets, claiming the city was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.” Officials there accused the administration of waging a politically motivated “hostile takeover.”

And in Minnesota, where thousands of federal officers descended in recent weeks, “news reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities,” according to Governor Tim Walz.

“This long ago stopped being a campaign of organized immigration enforcement,” he said January 13. “Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

“People are being racially profiled, harassed, terrorized, and assaulted,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement announcing a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of “spreading terror” in the state. “Schools have gone into lockdown. Businesses have been forced to close.”

Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration. In 2023, he told a crowd in Iowa that he would send troops into Democratic-run cities whether officials there wanted them or not.

“And one of the other things I’ll do — because you’re supposed to not be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in,” he said. “The next time, I’m not waiting.”

Facing widespread protests against his mass deportation campaign, and relying on varying justifications for their deployment, Trump did exactly that. In June, the president began ordering National Guard troops to several Democratic-led cities, an effort that one federal judge rebuked as “a national police force with the president as its chief.”

Legal challenges from state and local officials accused the administration of using American streets for political theater, an attempt to stir up unrest to justify the president’s military and federal law enforcement occupation of cities with large immigrant populations.

In December, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from sending the military into Chicago, and, sensing impending legal failures in the face of other lawsuits over his threats to put boots on the ground, Trump pulled out of the idea altogether on New Year’s Eve.

But the administration has continued to surge officers into Democratic-led cities, dovetailing with the president’s crusade of retribution against his political opponents.

In courtrooms across the country, protesters and detainees alleged officers shot them with chemical weapons at point-blank range, turned neighborhoods into “war zones” filled with tear gas, and racially profiled citizens and Native Americans before hauling them to detention centers.

The administration “has blown through normative guardrails to make mass deportations a central element of government function,” according to the Migration Policy Institute.

That “scorched-earth anti-immigration campaign” is “part of a broader Trump administration assault” on constitutional rights, from the arrests of international scholars Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk that presaged the administration’s threats to dissent, to his ongoing efforts to unilaterally define who gets to be a citizen, according to Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.

Days after an ICE officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, whose death sparked a renewed wave of protests and political outrage, Trump promised a “day of reckoning” for Minnesota, his latest target. “RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” he wrote.

Less than one year after she was sworn into office, Homeland Security Kristi Noem is now facing threats of impeachment from dozens of Democratic members of Congress. And years after moderate Democratic figures sidelined “abolish ICE” demands, lawmakers entered the new year mulling how to cut off new funding for the agency, potentially triggering yet another government shutdown in Trump’s second presidency.

The “abolish ICE” movement gained momentum on the political left under Trump’s first term after the administration’s catastrophic family separation policy and a fresh wave of raids and arrests. Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.

A record amount of new funding has turned ICE into the single largest federal law enforcement agency in the nation’s history, with nearly $15 billion a year to expand immigration detention and billions more dollars to recruit and hire officers.

Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.

Those arrests exploded alongside a historic expansion of immigration detention, with dozens of jails, makeshift facilities and state-backed facilities such as “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida and a wing of the notorious Angola prison in Louisiana holding more than 60,000 people at any given time, shipped around the country and jailed hundreds of miles from where they were picked up.

Unauthorized arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted. Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled. Detentions are at their highest level in modern American history.

More than 622,000 people were deported by the end of 2025, according to Homeland Security. But as many as 73 percent of those booked into ICE custody last year had no criminal convictions, according to ICE data reviewed by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

The administration has also “de-legalized” more than 1.5 million people who were already legally living and working in the United States, swiftly expanding the pool of “undocumented” or “illegal” immigrants who were following immigration law until the moment Trump’s government changed it.

Immigration agencies are canceling citizenship hearings and threatening green card holders and married immigrants interviewing for permanent legal status. Officers have arrested thousands of people who were showing up for court-ordered check-ins with ICE or immigration court hearings where they sought to make their case to stay in the country, with federal agents waiting on the other side of the door to literally rip them away from their lawyers and families.

With that radical expansion of the nation’s immigration detention centers came an avalanche of reports of abuse and neglect inside them.

A series of sworn testimonials from detainees at the largest ICE facility in the country allege deteriorating conditions and routine beatings that have left several people hospitalized, including detainees whose testicles were “firmly crushed” by guards.

Federal judges have intervened to force ICE to improve conditions inside facilities in New York and Chicago, where detainees were allegedly forced into cramped cells near open toilets without adequate food, water, clean clothing or a place to bathe or brush their teeth.

“After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district ... I have never encountered anything like this,” Trump-appointed Judge Gary Brown wrote in response to squalid conditions at one facility on Long Island.

He rebuked “chillingly brutal conditions” at the jail and questioned why ICE shouldn’t be held in contempt.

The agency’s behavior “shocks the conscience,” he wrote.",https://static.the-independent.com/2026/01/15/14/45/Ongoing-federal-immigration-crackdown-in-Minneapolis-stb4tb8d.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:41.572592

The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.
“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.","President Trump is facing signs that his immigration crackdown is losing popularity with American voters as fallout grows from the fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer this month.

Recent polling has found Trump’s approval on immigration at a low point and shown that even some Republican voters are critical of immigration officers’ approach.

The poll numbers come as some high-profile figures on the right have criticized ICE in the wake of the Minneapolis shooting, underscoring the potential political liability for the party as it heads into the midterms.

“This is the kind of political issue that can get out of control,” Republican strategist Jason Cabel Roe said.

Immigration has long been one of the president’s strong suits, and he won his second term partly on the promise of tough border policies and mass deportations.

But his administration’s aggressive moves have drawn sharp pushback from the left, prompted protests throughout the year and now appear to be dragging down his approval numbers.

A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found American approval of Trump’s immigration approach at its lowest point since he returned to the White House. In an AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration enforcement, down from a 49 percent high this spring. And a majority of voters in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS said ICE’s actions are making American cities less safe.

The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.

Administration officials have argued Ross acted out of self-defense, alleging Good was impeding federal law enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem swiftly labeled Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.”

A 53-percent majority of voters in a Quinnipiac Poll said the Minnesota shooting wasn’t justified, including 92 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of independents and 10 percent of Republicans.

The Reuters survey found a notable 39 percent of Republicans said officers should limit harm to others, even if they make fewer arrests as a result.

“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.

“Americans want to see immigrants that cause crime deported, but they’re much more tolerant of undocumented immigrants who’ve been here a long time and are contributing to the economy and otherwise not breaking laws,” he noted.

Another signal of frustration in the days since the Minneapolis shooting has come from a small handful of media figures popular on the right, even as Republicans in Washington have largely been supportive of the ICE operations.

Conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly warned that ICE “needs to deescalate.” And podcaster Joe Rogan, who boasts a right-leaning audience and backed Trump in 2024, questioned, “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo, ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”

“Here’s the reality: the President campaigned on and won an election based on his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history – he’s keeping his promise and the American people are appreciative,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to The Hill.

Good’s shooting has renewed some Democrats’ calls to abolish ICE. In an Economist/YouGov poll, a 46-percent plurality of respondents supported shuttering the agency, including 47 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans.

A CNN/SSRS poll found that, among the 56 percent of respondents who labeled the shooting an “inappropriate” use of force, 9 in 10 said it “reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.”

“There’s been a drip, drip downward as far as approval on how [Trump] is handling immigration,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Malloy noted that more than 8 in 10 voters said they’d seen video footage of the Minneapolis shooting just days afterward, and that it could grow to have an even larger impact as coverage continues.

Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said his party should seize on the issue entering the midterms, arguing Trump “is in trouble” because of the administration’s hard-line tactics.

“Whenever they get a chance to talk immigration or health care or the economy, they should [talk about it] because people are against Trump on all of it,” Vale argued.

Democratic strategist Anthony Coley said Democrats should frame the argument as anti-American.

“What ever happened to ‘love thy neighbor as thyself’?” Coley said. “What Trump is doing on immigration isn’t about right vs. left. It’s about right vs. wrong. It’s immoral and anti-American, and that’s how Democrats should talk about it.”

Some Democrats, though, stress the party should be strategic in seizing on the controversy: A memo from the center-left think tank Third Way cautions the party to “abolish ICE abuses — not ICE” to avoid the blowback that came with prior calls to “defund the police.”

Some Republicans argue the winds will shift in the GOP’s favor when it comes to immigration. GOP strategist Ford O’Connell forecasts Trump “is going to prevail on this issue” because Democrats “will go too far” with calls to curtail ICE.

“Democrats think that this is going to be a winning issue for them, and they’re going to be wrong,” O’Connell said.

Still, Republican strategist Doug Heye said this might be a problem for Republicans in the midterm elections because “they’ve backed themselves into a corner on this.”

“They can oppose some administration policies — which leads [the media] to go mental with the ‘What does it say about Trump’s hold on the party?’ — but they can’t challenge him on things that are core to his identity. And this is,” Heye said.

White House border czar Tom Homan this week said the Trump administration needs “to be better at messaging what we’re doing out there” when it comes to immigration, arguing it faces “a lot of false media.”

Despite the signals of voter frustration, whether immigration and ICE actions remain a problem for the GOP in the midterms depends on what happens next, Republican strategists said.

“It depends how the Democrats respond. I think if the Democrats become anti-ICE and anti-law enforcement, I think that that will only help Republicans. If instead Democrats use this opening to rebrand themselves as more middle-of-the-road on immigration … that could help them politically,” Conant said.

Though Trump’s overall disapproval rating is reaching all-time highs as the immigration debate intensifies, Republicans “have plenty of time to claw some of this back” before November, said Scott Tranter, director of data science for Decision Desk HQ.

“What will be interesting to me is if it affects some of the big primaries, which will have an effect on control. Like, how does this play in the Texas Senate primary in two months? … How does this play out in the Michigan open Senate race? Immigration is obviously a big issue,” Tranter said.

The polling is a problem “in the immediate,” Roe said, but there will be “a thousand outrages” in the 10 months until Election Day.

“So it is an issue, but I imagine it’s going to get replaced by other issues. But it also depends on how things play out from here,” Roe said, crediting some of the anger over ICE to media coverage and blue-state leaders not cooperating with the agency’s actions.

Republican strategist Brian Seitchik, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, agreed with that sentiment.

“This is short-term pain for long-term gain,” Seitchik said.

Republicans running in the midterms “are simply going to have to weather the storm.”

“There’s no magic to get around it,” Seitchik said. “All we can do is make Americans see the long-term benefit.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/ImmigrationCrackdown_Mueller_AP_AdamGray.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:36.229039

Indigenous members of the Arizona House Democratic Caucus on Friday condemned what they described as the unlawful detention of a Navajo man by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As the man at the center of the incident recounts what happened, he said the encounter left him fearful, traumatized and questioning his safety in his own homeland.

In a statement released Jan. 16, Reps. Brian Garcia of Tempe, Mae Peshlakai of Cameron and Myron Tsosie of Chinle rebuked ICE agents for detaining Peter Yazzie, a Diné, earlier this month while he was in the Phoenix area for work. The lawmakers said Yazzie was carrying valid tribal identification and a birth certificate at the time but was detained anyway.

According to the statement, Yazzie was approached by ICE agents while traveling to work in Peoria, Arizona. Media reports and a viral TikTok video shared by Yazzie prompted widespread concern and scrutiny, leading Indigenous lawmakers to publicly denounce the incident and call attention to what they described as systemic targeting of Native Americans.

“ICE agents continue to show a complete disregard for the rule of law and have absolutely no justifiable reason to go after Indigenous Tribal members,” the lawmakers wrote in their joint statement. “In case they need a history lesson, tribal members are United States citizens.”

They added that Yazzie “should never have been approached” and said that instead of being immediately released with an apology, he was “manhandled, detained and accused of lying and theft.”

Lawmakers condemn detention, call it unlawful

Federal authorities have not publicly released details of the incident. In recent days, Yazzie has shared his account on social media, describing being detained by multiple law enforcement vehicles in Phoenix.

Yazzie said he often sleeps in his vehicle while working in the Phoenix area during the winter months, explaining that the weather allows him to do so as he travels for construction work throughout the year.

“I’m saying that I live out of my ride because, I mean, it’s Phoenix in the wintertime. It’s perfect weather,” Yazzie said. “I do that almost every year. I work in Phoenix throughout the winter, travel in the summer times.”

He said the incident happened early in the morning as he was preparing for work.

“I start work at five, I’m up at four, and I was getting ready, putting on my work shirt, standing outside of my ride,” he said.

Yazzie said several vehicles, including Suburbans, pulled into the area one after another, with only two using lights. At first, he believed law enforcement was conducting a raid unrelated to him.

“They got out and had ‘Police’ written on the back of their vest, so I’m thinking this must be like a drug raid or something,” he said.

Yazzie said officers began yelling commands at him, ordering him to face his vehicle and place his hands on it. He said he complied immediately.

“Where I’m from, you learn that when it comes to the law, you do what you’re told. Otherwise, things escalate,” he said.

He said he watched another man forcibly removed from his truck.

“They pull another guy out of his truck, and they drag him on the ground, like literally dragged him on the ground,” Yazzie said.

Moments later, he said, officers forced him to the pavement.

“They tossed me down, knees on the back, facing the pavement,” he said.

Yazzie said he realized the encounter involved immigration enforcement only after hearing an officer identify himself.

“That’s when I heard him say, ‘immigration control,’” Yazzie said.

He said he immediately told agents that he is Navajo and had identification inside his vehicle, including his wallet, Social Security card, Certificate of Indian Blood and birth certificate.

“I’m full-blooded Native,” he said. “My wallet’s in the car. My ID’s in there. My Social Security card. The backpack in the back seat has my CIB and my birth certificate.”

Despite this, Yazzie said he was placed inside a vehicle while agents searched his car.

“They start pulling off, and I’m like, ‘Why are we leaving? You guys have my identification,’” he said.

Yazzie recounts early-morning stop, detention

Yazzie said agents accused him of stealing both the vehicle and his identity.

“They said that car came back under another name. It’s not listed under the name you gave us, which leads us to believe you stole the vehicle and you stole your identity as well,” he said. “They told me I had 24 hours for my information to come back, otherwise they’d place me with the rest of the deportation detainees.”

He said the threat left him imagining the worst.

“I’m thinking, ‘What the hell? I have a job. I have bills. I have kids,” he said. “And their response was, ‘Oh, we’ll get them next.’”

Yazzie said that at that point he stopped trying to explain himself.

“They’re not listening to me, no matter what I say,” he said.

While detained, Yazzie said he encountered other men who were also picked up while going about their daily lives.

“These were guys who, just like me, left early one morning for work or left to get dinner for their families and never came home,” he said.

He said several men asked him to notify their families if he was released.

“I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a grown man with fear and desperation in his eyes,” Yazzie said. “If that doesn’t move you, then you’re not human.”

Yazzie said he was eventually released without explanation or apology.

“They let me go. Not so much as an apology,” he said.

When he returned to his vehicle, he said it had been ransacked.

“They took everything out, ran through everything,” he said. “I had to fix up my car. I had to call my superintendent, my general foreman, my actual foreman and notify them what happened.”

He said the experience has had a lasting impact on his sense of safety.

“I’m not gonna lie. This is something that has me angry, stressed and worried,” he said. “I gotta look over my shoulder all the time now.”

He said the treatment went beyond racism.

“This is racism, but it’s beyond racism,” Yazzie said. “This is hating someone like they’re a pest or a rodent.”

He compared the experience to being dehumanized in his own homeland.

“You’re treated like a stray dog, like you don’t belong here,” he said. “And not only that, we don’t need to earn a place here. This is where we’re from.”

Yazzie said his family’s roots run deep on this land.

“This is where I was born. My parents were born, my grandparents, great-great-grandparents, all the way down the line,” he said. “We’ve never been nowhere else.”

Encounter changes sense of safety

The Arizona lawmakers echoed those sentiments in their statement, saying ICE’s actions are “making everyone less safe” and accusing Republican-supported immigration policies of violating basic rights and human dignity.

“It has to stop,” the lawmakers said.

In follow-up posts, Yazzie said the attention surrounding his story has brought both support and fear. He said people have offered him places to stay, meals and assistance, but he has remained cautious.

“I feel like I put a large target on my back,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been back in survival mode.”

He said he has changed locations nightly and remains hyper-aware of his surroundings.

“When I’m asleep in my car, I’ll hear a door shut or some kind of fast movement, and I’m just waiting for that knock at the window,” he said.

Despite the trauma, Yazzie said he continues to believe change is possible.

“I still believe we have enough humanity in us to come back from this,” he said. “To turn things around.”

Three members of the Oglala Sioux tribe were detained by ICE, and continue to remain in their custody in Minneapolis, according to their tribal officials.

Federal officials have not publicly commented on the incident. The Arizona lawmakers said they are calling for accountability and greater protections for Indigenous people who they say continue to be wrongfully targeted by immigration enforcement.

One lawsuit by the ACLU has already resulted in a federal judge, Kate Menendez, issuing an order restricting what ICE agents can do when confronting peaceful protestors.

The judge's order says there can be no ICE retaliation against protestors, no detaining people without probable cause unless they are obstructing agents or committing a crime, no using pepper spray on a peaceful protest, and allowing drivers to follow ICE agents' vehicles at a safe distance. On ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" this Sunday morning, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the order changes nothing about how federal agents are conducting their business in Minnesota.

Another development is that the U.S. Justice Department has opened criminal investigations into Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly obstructing the work of federal agents.

Appearing on WCCO Sunday Morning with Esme Murphy, Attorney General Keith Ellison called this latter investigation ""from the playbook.""

""This is the president who is persecuting Jerome Powell of the Fed, who tried to prosecute James Comey of the FBI, and the current attorney general of New York, Letitia James. He uses the criminal justice system to persecute the people he doesn't like,"" Ellison said.

The second federal lawsuit against ICE was filed late last week by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. It seeks to stop ICE activity throughout the state. The lawsuit argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

That lawsuit argues that President Trump is retaliating against Gov. Tim Walz, who ran against Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' ticket, for his objections to ICE activity.

""What the federal government needs to do is leave and stop the surge,"" Ellison said.

The Tenth Amendment protects states' sovereignty and limits federal powers to those granted in the U.S. Constitution. It provides autonomy to the states in issues like education, elections and public safety. While Ellison is optimistic, some legal experts think the lawsuit is a long shot because it would be similar to telling the FBI it could not operate in the state.

The state, in this second lawsuit, is seeking an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. The judge in the case is Kate Menendez, the same judge who issued that first order favorable to peaceful protestors. The judge said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government. That response is due to be filed at 5 p.m. Monday, which is the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/454ef978-d6d2-43d0-8b1d-d216d2fde6fa/thumbnail/1200x630/bf35a562013bb6332b90700dad4b5214/gettyimages-2256249848.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:59.089111

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained.
Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.
That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.
Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.","Donald Trump’s escalating calls for the United States to seize or otherwise obtain Greenland has ignited fresh criticism from the president’s own Republican party, with some saying it could hurt the US economically or strain the Nato military alliance.

Such Republicans included US senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, who were part of a bipartisan group to travel to Denmark to discuss concerns in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.

Both Tillis and Murkowski sharply criticized new tariffs threatened on Saturday by Trump on a slew of European countries – including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland.

Murkowski wrote on X that the tariffs were “unnecessary, punitive, and a profound mistake”, coming after Nato allies deployed troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island if needed.

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained. “We are already seeing the consequences of these measures in real time: our Nato allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”

She urged Congress to exercise its authority over tariffs to ensure they are “not weaponized in ways that harm our alliances and undermine American leadership”.

Tillis, for his part, wrote on X: “This response to our own allies for sending a small number of troops to Greenland for training is bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies. It’s great for Putin, [Chinese leader] Xi [Jiping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.”

Tillis added that “actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid”.

“It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the Nato alliance over the years,” Tillis maintained.

Mike Pence, the US vice-president during Trump’s first White House term, separately said he believed “the current posture … does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our Nato allies”.

“Denmark is a very strong ally of the United States of American,” Pence said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week, McCaul said: “The fact is, the president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat” that could materialize on the Arctic island.

“So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that’s one thing,” he continued. “But for him to militarily invade would turn … Nato on its very head and, in essence, press a war with Nato itself. It would end up abolishing Nato as we know it.”

Trump has repeatedly argued that US control of the island is necessary for national security, pointing to concerns about Russia and China expanding their influence in the Arctic. That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.

During a Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican US senator Rand Paul weighed in, saying it “ridiculous” to portray Greenland as some urgent situation.

“There’s no emergency with Greenland,” Paul said.

Trump has insisted that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect Greenland in the case of a confrontation with China or Russia, even as he has also said that “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish territory.

The goal of the bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers who traveled to meet with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen was to emphasize the Republican dissent to any suggestion that the United States should forcefully seize Greenland.

Polling also shows a substantial majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island.

Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.

Gingrich went on Sunday’s Cats Roundtable radio program and called Trump’s posture with Greenland “a lot of noise to set up a negotiation to get what he wants”.

That “is tourist rights, economic rights, mineral rights and national security rights”, Gingrich said.

Gingrich pointed to Greenland’s abundance of natural resources and noted that China, Russia and the US all have an interest in accessing its minerals. He also called Greenland’s oil and gas reserves “a huge economic opportunity”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7cc9c3ff5d5cee2fddc4c47ef39c344dab03d2a/639_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=663dab34da0603d7b41b99cae84c3a73",N,,2026-01-18 14:57:24.932607

Momentum in Democratic-led states for the measures, some of them proposed for years, is growing as legislatures return to work following the killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. But Republicans are pushing back, blaming protesters for impeding the enforcement of immigration laws.

Democratic bills seek to limit ICE

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to allow people to sue federal officers alleging violations of their constitutional rights. Another measure aims to keep immigration officers lacking judicial warrants out of schools, hospitals and houses of worship.

Oregon Democrats plan to introduce a bill to allow residents to sue federal officers for violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.

New Jersey's Democrat-led Legislature passed three bills Monday that immigrant rights groups have long pushed for, including a measure prohibiting state law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has until his last day in office Tuesday to sign or veto them.

California lawmakers are proposing to ban local and state law enforcement from taking second jobs with the Department of Homeland Security and make it a violation of state law when ICE officers make ""indiscriminate"" arrests around court appearances. Other measures are pending.

""Where you have government actions with no accountability, that is not true democracy,"" Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said at a news conference.

Democrats also push bills in red states

Democrats in Georgia introduced four Senate bills designed to limit immigration enforcement — a package unlikely to become law because Georgia's conservative upper chamber is led by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a close Trump ally. Democrats said it is still important to take a stand.

""Donald Trump has unleashed brutal aggression on our families and our communities across our country,"" said state Sen. Sheikh Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh whose district in suburban Atlanta's Gwinnett County is home to many immigrants.

Democrats in New Hampshire have proposed numerous measures seeking to limit federal immigration enforcement, but the state's Republican majorities passed a new law taking effect this month that bans ""sanctuary cities.""

Tennessee GOP works with White House

The bills Tennessee Republicans are introducing appear to require government agencies to check the legal status of all residents before they can obtain public benefits; secure licenses for teaching, nursing and other professions; and get driver's licenses or register their cars.

They also would include verifying K-12 students' legal status, which appears to conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. And they propose criminalizing illegal entry as a misdemeanor, a measure similar to several other states' requirements, some of which are blocked in court.

""We're going to do what we can to make sure that if you're here illegally, we will have the data, we'll have the transparency, and we're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail,"" House Speaker Cameron Sexton said at a news conference Thursday.

Trump administration sues to stop laws

The Trump administration has opposed any effort to blunt ICE, including suing local governments whose ""sanctuary"" policies limit police interactions with federal officers.

States have broad power to regulate within their borders unless the U.S. Constitution bars it, but many of these laws raise novel issues that courts will have to sort out, said Harrison Stark, senior counsel with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

""There's not a super clear, concrete legal answer to a lot of these questions,"" he said. ""It's almost guaranteed there will be federal litigation over a lot of these policies.""

That is already happening.

California in September was the first to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration officers, from covering their faces on duty. The Justice Department said its officers won't comply and sued California, arguing that the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing ""unprecedented"" harassment, doxing and violence.

The Justice Department also sued Illinois last month, challenging a law that bars federal civil arrests near courthouses, protects medical records and regulates how universities and day care centers manage information about immigration status. The Justice Department claims the law is unconstitutional and threatens federal officers' safety.

Targeted states push back

Minnesota and Illinois, joined by their largest cities, sued the Trump administration this past week. Minneapolis and Minnesota accuse the Republican administration of violating free speech rights by punishing a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants. Illinois and Chicago claim ""Operation Midway Blitz"" made residents afraid to leave their homes.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety and called the Illinois lawsuit ""baseless.""

— Terik Hashmi, immigration attorney with International Law Group

WASHINGTON DC, DC, UNITED STATES, January 18, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — U.S. immigration law firm International Law Group (ILG) announced today that it is offering rapid-response immigration consultations for Venezuelan nationals and families in the Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area who are facing heightened immigration enforcement, status uncertainty, or expiring protections.

Recent federal actions and policy changes by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have created widespread confusion and anxiety among Venezuelans, particularly those relying on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pending asylum applications, work permits, or other humanitarian and employment-based immigration benefits. Increased data reviews, background checks, Requests for Evidence (RFEs), Notices to Appear, and referrals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have made early legal review critical.

“Many Venezuelans in the DMV area are understandably worried about what these changes mean for their families, jobs, and futures,” said Terik Hashmi, senior attorney at International Law Group. “Our message is simple: don’t panic, but don’t wait. Ignoring a notice or assuming nothing will happen can be a serious mistake. Early legal guidance can significantly change the outcome.”

To meet urgent demand, International Law Group is offering confidential Zoom consultations, including evenings and weekends, to quickly assess risk, explain options, and help clients respond appropriately to government action.

International Law Group services include:

• Emergency Zoom consultations (available nationwide)

• Review of USCIS, DHS, and ICE notices

• TPS status review and transition strategies

• Asylum and humanitarian case audits

• Work permit (EAD) and Green Card planning

• ICE encounter preparedness and rights counseling

International Law Group has decades of experience representing immigrants in high-stakes, time-sensitive cases, including those involving sudden policy shifts, enforcement actions, and humanitarian crises.

Adds Mike Meier, senior attorney at International Law Group: “Consultations are confidential and designed for urgent situations. We strongly encourage Venezuelan community members in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia who have received notices, whose TPS or work authorization is expiring, or who are unsure about their current status to speak with an experienced immigration attorney immediately.”

""These law enforcement officers are out there every day doing the work to protect the American people, and they will keep doing that because they believe in enforcing the law, which is exactly what President Trump has charged them with,"" Noem said on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

Transcript: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan""

A federal judge on Friday blocked federal law enforcement from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters as demonstrations continue. The judge also barred federal agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is ""no reasonable articulable suspicion"" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.

On Sunday, Noem called the order ""a little ridiculous.""

""We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,"" Noem said. ""So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.""

Thousands of federal agents have been deployed to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks for immigration enforcement operations and to investigate fraud allegations in the state. Federal law enforcement agents have faced allegations of using aggressive tactics.

Noem put the blame on protesters and local leaders for violent incidents, including one in which a couple said they and their six children were tear-gassed while driving home from basketball practice.

""That family was caught up in that situation because of violent protesters that were impeding law enforcement operations, and that family would have never been in that situation if those protesters had been acting peacefully and law enforcement was able to do their job without being threatened,"" the secretary said.

Noem said ""the mayor and the governor have allowed this kind of violence to be perpetuated across Minneapolis,"" claiming it's ""why there's other innocent people that are impacted throughout the city.""

The administration has faced renewed scrutiny and ramped-up protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Last week, Senate Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged the GOP chairman to call Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify before the panel.

Noem said Sunday that Good ""weaponized her car and threatened the life of a law enforcement officer and those around him."" She said the 37-year-old woman was ""impeding law enforcement operations for quite some time before this incident happened,"" while saying the incident was a ""tragedy."" She added that the officer ""relied on his training to defend his life and to defend those around him.""

Asked whether the agency was conducting a review of the agent who shot Good, Noem said, ""We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/edf04c16-ba1d-4629-bf3d-0734361dbf88/thumbnail/1200x630/714a0d3d1a59cc46e31671a3199faf8e/noem-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:57:44.324253

In the CBS News/YouGov poll conducted late last week, 61 percent of respondents say the way ICE is conducting its operations when it stops or detains people is “too tough,” while 15 percent say it’s “not tough enough.” Another 24 percent say it’s “about right.” That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.
Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.

The shift comes mostly from Democrats and independents, both of which saw a 9-percentage point increase in the share who say the way ICE has conducted its operations has been too tough — to 94 percent and 68 percent, respectively.

Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

Similarly, the latest poll shows Americans are increasingly doubting the administration’s claims that it is prioritizing “dangerous criminals” in deporting migrants who are living in the country illegally.

Today, 56 percent of people say the Trump administration is prioritizing for deportation “people who aren’t dangerous criminals,” up from 52 percent in the November poll.

Overall support for Trump’s program to deport immigrants are in the country illegally has dropped, from 52 percent in the November poll to 46 percent now.

The poll was conducted a week after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good during a standoff with protesters in Minneapolis. The Trump administration maintains the officer acted in self-defense and feared for his life, pointing to video footage it says shows Good was using her car to threaten his life. Critics, however, say the footage shows Good was trying to drive away from the officer, not run him over.

On Wednesday, the first day of the three-day poll, another ICE officer shot and injured a Venezuelan migrant in Minneapolis after the officer was allegedly attacked when following the target on foot after he fled a traffic stop.

The latest survey included 2,523 adults and was conducted Jan. 14-16. The margin of error is 2.3 percentage points.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Leading-ICE_011126_AP_Jen-Golbeck.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 16:58:07.236877

Editor’s Note: The above guest column was penned by James C. Harrington, retired founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project and an Episcopal priest in Austin.","We typically commemorate the Martin Luther King holiday with his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. This time around, it would behoove us to pay attention to his powerful 1967 speech at Riverside Church, “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence,” opposing the war in Vietnam.

The moral principles he affirmed, with Rabbi Abraham Heschel, himself a great moral leader, at his side, apply with piercing relevance to the upheaval facing our democracy today.

State terrorism against the immigrant community confronts us daily. Agents with face masks and no identification inflict harm on families as men masked with white hoods once did when perpetrating evil on the nation’s minority communities.

People have been killed, families broken up, and small children handcuffed. There has been long-term detention in disgusting facilities, and people dispatched to countries which are foreign to them. We see attacks on boats, killing people with impunity. Congress is lamer than ever in asserting the rule of law.

Amnesty protections have been abandoned, regardless of how severe the persecution and oppression that immigrant families had to flee or the economic disaster they faced. There have been mass deportations, no matter how many years immigrants have lived as our neighbors and supported our country. Never mind the risk to them if they return to their former homeland.

Dismantling the safety net for vulnerable America’s seniors and poor is underway. The world’s wealthiest country now denies aid to poor countries facing immeasurable poverty and rampant violence. Free speech and dissent are on the Administration’s and Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s chopping block.

We are replicating those dark days of American history from which we thought we had emerged.

Fort Bliss in El Paso, a major immigrant detention facility, was a Japanese internment site 80 years ago. The national security rhetoric used to justify mass incarceration today is the same used for the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans.

The Administration’s actions are against people of color—the same grievance Dr. King articulated about the Vietnam war.

Dr. King understood the retaliation he would suffer for his speech, but his moral challenge to the government was necessary, and correct. He lost significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, and the powerful media. His popularity sank because he did not stick to the “civil rights script” expected of him.

Howard Thurman, the premier Black theologian, in his 1946 essay, “The Fascist Masquerade,” faulted the Christian church for “the bitter truth” of permitting hate-inspired groups … to establish squatter’s rights in the middle of believers because there has been no adequate teaching on the meaning of faith, the faith in terms of human dignity and human worth.”

Faith groups are finally heading his warning. For religious folks, as for non-believers, this current struggle is about the inherent dignity of people and fairness, or, as Pope Leo has forcefully framed it, the core values of democracy.

At a January 9th candlelight vigil for Renee Nicole Good, two days are an ICE agent killed her, Bishop Rob Hirschfeld of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire announced he had advised his clergy, “that we may be entering into that same witness,” and to get their affairs in order and write their wills because “it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us, with our bodies, to stand between the powers of this world, and the most vulnerable.”

Dr. King put his body on the line, as had countless others for a more just society.

For Dr. King’s holiday this year, we must jettison our comfort zone and not rest on the laurels we thought that society had accomplished, but which our federal and state governments are steadfastly discarding with abandon.

The call for us is to accept that moral challenge and shed our complacency and, as Dr. King put it in 1967, “go down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land” before “America's soul becomes totally poisoned.”

It is time to break silence and put our bodies on the line.

To find out, I sat down with immigration attorney Adriana Pereyra of Integrity Law Firm, who says what's happening in Southern Nevada isn't always visible.

""How often are we seeing this? Is this happening a lot more often than what people are actually realizing?"" I asked.

""Yes, it definitely is. Even my clients who are detained have told me, you know, they bring 10-15 people a day, just in Henderson detention center,"" Pereyra said.

Here's why that matters: Under federal immigration law, ICE has the authority, including through what's called the 287(G) program, to operate with local jails. ICE can identify and take into federal custody people who were booked into jail.

""ICE is still very involved here in our community?"" I asked.

""Absolutely they're just doing it in a different way that is not so public,"" Pereyra said

.According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website, ICE also maintains holding facilities in Southern Nevada, including the Henderson Detention Center and the Nevada Southern Detention Center, where people taken into ICE custody can be detained for immigration proceedings.

A federal appeals court in Washington denied Trump's request to halt the judge's ruling, prompting his request to the Supreme Court.
Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley ‍Law School, said the court's interest in protecting Fed independence likely will be very important as it weighs Cook's case.
""In Trump v. Wilcox, the court discussed the Fed being different even though it had nothing to do with that case,"" Chemerinsky added.","WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court signaled four months into Donald Trump's second presidential term last year its interest in shielding the Federal Reserve from political interference. When the justices on Wednesday consider the legality of his bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, their willingness to preserve the U.S. central bank's independence will be ​put to the test.

With control over U.S. monetary policy at stake, the legal battle over Trump's attempt to remove Cook marks the second case involving an action by the Republican president of vast economic significance ‌to reach the Supreme Court during its current term, which began in October.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments in November concerning Trump's sweeping global tariffs, with justices indicating skepticism over the lawfulness of these import taxes on nearly every U.S. trading partner imposed under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Its rulings in the tariffs and Cook cases are expected by the end of June but could come sooner.

The court has been largely deferential to Trump in a series of rulings on an emergency basis since his return to office 12 months ago as he repeatedly tests the limits of presidential authority. The justices, however, may be less eager to strengthen Trump's hand over the economy.

""I think they worry about the effect that removal of central ‌bank independence could have on the economy,"" said John Yoo, who served as a Justice Department lawyer under Republican former President George W. Bush.

""It seems a basic principle of macroeconomics, ​backed up by the experience of other countries, that political control over the money supply, interest rates and central banking will inevitably lead to inflation,"" said Yoo, now a University of California, Berkeley law professor.

According to legal scholars, the court has not been so directly involved in U.S. economic policy since the justices weighed the constitutionality of Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's muscular agenda called the New Deal during the 1930s amid the crisis of the Great Depression.

'NOT UNBOUNDED'

Columbia Law School professor Kathryn ‍Judge said the fights involving Fed independence and Trump's tariffs ""will be key in determining the scope of the president's authority to unilaterally determine economic policy.""

""This Supreme Court has taken a very expansive approach to executive authority,"" Judge said, ""but it is not unbounded.""

Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump in August after he sought to fire her, an unprecedented step by a president against a central bank official. Trump claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before being appointed to the ⁠Fed by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden in 2022, an allegation she denied and described as a pretext to try to remove her for her monetary policy stance.

Similarly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sunday called a criminal investigation of him launched by ‍Trump's Justice Department a pretext to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy. The investigation centers on Powell's congressional testimony about a Fed building project.

Critics see the steps by Trump and his administration targeting Cook and Powell as a bid to ‌pressure the Fed ‌to lower interest rates before the November midterm elections in which Democrats are hoping to regain control of Congress from the Republicans. Pocketbook concerns may loom large for voters.

""With each passing day - and with each passing attack by the Trump administration - I suspect that the court increasingly sees the value of an independent Fed,"" University of Illinois Chicago law professor Steve Schwinn said.

Yoo added that ""Trump is not helping his own case with the Department of Justice's implausible criminal investigation"" of Powell.

REMOVAL PROTECTIONS

Cook has said Trump's allegations of mortgage fraud did not empower him to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act, the law that created the central bank in 1913. Aiming to insulate the Fed's decision-making from politics, Congress included provisions constraining a president's ability ⁠to fire a Fed governor, allowing removal only for adequate ""cause,"" ⁠not policy differences.

A Washington-based federal judge ruled that Trump's ​claims were likely insufficient grounds to fire Cook. A federal appeals court in Washington denied Trump's request to halt the judge's ruling, prompting his request to the Supreme Court.

Legal analysts said the justices have offered recent clues signaling their interest in protecting the Fed's independence. For instance, they allowed Cook to remain in her post as the case plays out after allowing Trump to remove officials from other agencies with similar tenure protections while those cases proceed.

Last May, the court let Trump fire two Democratic members of federal labor boards ‍while challenges to their removals continue in lower courts. In that ruling, called Trump v. Wilcox, the court sought to allay concerns that letting the president fire officials from federal labor boards would imperil the independence of the Fed.

""We disagree,"" the court wrote in an unsigned opinion. ""The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.""

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley ‍Law School, said the court's interest in protecting Fed independence likely will be very important as it weighs Cook's case.

""In Trump v. Wilcox, the court discussed the Fed being different even though it had nothing to do with that case,"" Chemerinsky added.

“I think it lays out some ground rules going forward for ICE to operate within,” says Ryan Wood, a former chief immigration court judge. “It really lays out the framework for future court actions for violating those court orders.”

The decision, by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, prohibits federal immigration agents in Minnesota from arresting, detaining or retaliating against peaceful protesters or observers.

They also can’t use pepper spray or other non-lethal munitions against them.

“These are just some of the foundational and fundamental principles under which any law enforcement operation really needs to abide,” notes Jessica West, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. “I think her goal was to start the process of having a dialogue between law enforcement and the courts about what is and what is not permissible.”

But the injunction goes further.

It says federal officers can’t stop or detain drivers or passengers in vehicles with no reasonable suspicion that they’re forcibly obstructing or interfering with agents.

That includes those following at an “appropriate distance.”

Wood says he’s concerned about clarity in the ruling.

“These are all messy situations,” he explains. “What does it mean to have a reasonable distance between a protester and an arrest incident? What does it mean to have a reasonable distance by an ICE vehicle and a vehicle that’s following it?”

The ruling follows a case filed in December by six Minnesota activist-observers, represented by the ACLU.

RELATED: ACLU sues ICE, claiming federal agents deprived citizens of civil rights

Their argument — that government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

West believes the government will appeal, but she says there’s an opportunity for the Department of Homeland Security as well.

“One potential way the government could take this is to start to not only train and hand this order out to their officers on the ground,” she notes. “To start to correct information about who’s doing what, where, when, and hold some of those people accountable; to change the culture a little bit.”

After the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency is taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters. We remind the public that rioting is dangerous — obstructing law enforcement is a federal crime and assaulting law enforcement is a felony.”

The statement went on to say: “Rioters and terrorists have assaulted law enforcement, launched fireworks at them, slashed the tires of their vehicles, and vandalized federal property. Others have chosen to ignore commands and have attempted to impede law enforcement operations and used their vehicles as weapons against our officers. Despite these grave threats and dangerous situations, our law enforcement as followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The judge ordered the federal government to inform all officers about the ruling within 72 hours as of Friday night.

So far, DHS has not commented on whether there would be an appeal to the ruling and what the process would be to get information about it to officers in the field.

Wood says he hopes the judge’s ruling will make a difference.

“I think this one might have more legs and really provide some careful guardrails for ICE to operate within,” he notes. “I’m hopeful that this court decision will provide some guidance to them, education as to the boundaries and the elements of impeding federal law enforcement officers.”",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FED-JUDGE-PROTEST-RULING_PKG_KSTPb6fa_146_mxf_00.00.06.42.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:04.723785

Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.

In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program — which has roughly divided the nation for months — has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.

And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.

There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.

So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.

Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.

More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.

Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.

Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.

Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.

Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.

Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran

Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.

Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.

Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.

The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.

Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.

What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?

Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.

Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.

Democratic lawmakers and candidates for office around the country increasingly are returning to the phrase, popularized during the first Trump administration, as they react to this administration’s forceful immigration enforcement tactics.

The fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent this month in Minneapolis sparked immediate outrage among Democratic officials, who proposed a variety of oversight demands — including abolishing the agency — to rein in tactics they view as hostile and sometimes illegal.

Resurrecting the slogan is perhaps the riskiest approach. Republicans pounced on the opportunity to paint Democrats, especially those in vulnerable seats, as extremists.

“If their response is to dust off ‘defund ICE,’ we’re happy to take that fight any day of the week,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group has published dozens of press statements in recent weeks accusing Democrats of wanting to abolish ICE — even those who haven’t made direct statements using the phrase.

Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) amplified that message Wednesday, writing on social media that “When Democrats say they want to abolish or defund ICE, what they are really saying is they want to go back to the open borders policies of the Biden administration. The American people soundly rejected that idea in the 2024 election.”

The next day, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced the “Abolish ICE Act,” stating that Good’s killing “proved that ICE is out of control and beyond reform.” The bill would rescind the agency’s “unobligated” funding and redirect other assets to its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

Many Democrats calling for an outright elimination of ICE come from the party’s progressive wing. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said in a television interview the agency should be abolished because actions taken by its agents are “racist” and “rogue.” Jack Schlossberg, who is running for a House seat in New York, said that “if Trump’s ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it.”

Other prominent progressives have stopped short of saying the agency should be dismantled.

Sen. Alex Padilla, (D-Calif.) who last year was forcefully handcuffed and removed from a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joined a protest in Washington to demand justice for Good, saying “It’s time to get ICE and CBP out,” referring to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“This is a moment where all of us have to be forceful to ensure that we are pushing back on what is an agency right now that is out of control,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said on social media. “We have to be loud and clear that ICE is not welcome in our communities.”

Others have eyed negotiations over the yearly Homeland Security budget as a leverage point to incorporate their demands, such as requiring federal agents to remove their masks and to turn on their body-worn cameras when on duty, as well as calling for agents who commit crimes on the job to be prosecuted. Seventy House Democrats, including at least 13 from California, backed a measure to impeach Noem.

Rep. Mike Levin (D-San Diego), who serves on the House Committee on Appropriations, said his focus is not on eliminating the agency, which he believes has an “important responsibility” but has been led astray by Noem.

He said Noem should be held to account for her actions through congressional oversight hearings, not impeachment — at least not while Republicans would be in control of the proceedings, since he believes House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) would make a “mockery” of them.

“I am going to use the appropriations process,” Levin said, adding that he would “continue to focus on the guardrails, regardless of the rhetoric.”

Chuck Rocha, a Democratic political strategist, said Republicans seized on the abolitionist rhetoric as a scare tactic to distract from the rising cost of living, which remains another top voter concern.

“They hope to distract [voters] by saying, ‘Sure, we’re going to get better on the economy — but these Democrats are still crazy,’” he said.

Democrats have for years struggled to put forward a unified vision on immigration — one of the top issues that won President Trump a return to the White House. Any deal to increase guardrails on Homeland Security faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Congress, leaving many proposals years away from the possibility of fruition. Even if Democrats manage to block the yearly funding bill, the agency still has tens of billions of dollars from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Still, the roving raids, violent clashes with protesters and detentions and deaths of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike increased the urgency many lawmakers feel to do something.

Two centrist groups released memos last week written by former Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration urging Democrats to avoid the polarizing language and instead channel their outrage into specific reforms.

“Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want,” wrote the authors of one memo, from the Washington-based think tank Third Way.

“Advocating for abolishing ICE is tantamount to advocating for stopping enforcement of all of our immigration laws in the interior of the United States — a policy position that is both wrong on the merits and at odds with the American public on the issue,” wrote Blas Nuñez-Neto, a senior policy fellow at the new think tank the Searchlight Institute who previously was assistant Homeland Security secretary.

Roughly 46% of Americans said they support the idea of abolishing ICE, while 43% are opposed, according to a YouGov/Economist poll released last week.

Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services who co-wrote the Third Way memo, said future polls might show less support for abolishing the agency, particularly if the question is framed as a choice among options including reforms such as banning agents from wearing masks or requiring use of body cameras.

“There’s no doubt there will be further tragedies and with each, the effort to take an extreme position like abolishing ICE increases,” she said.

Laura Hernandez, executive director of Freedom for Immigrants, a California-based organization that advocates for the closure of detention centers, said the increase in lawmakers calling to abolish ICE is long overdue.

“We need lawmakers to use their power to stop militarized raids, to close detention centers and we need them to shut down ICE and CBP,” she said. “This violence that people are seeing on television is not new, it’s literally built into the DNA of DHS.”

Cinthya Martinez, a UC Santa Cruz professor who has studied the movement to abolish ICE, noted that it stems from the movement to abolish prisons. The abolition part, she said, is watered down by mainstream politicians even as some liken immigration agents to modern-day slave patrols.

Martinez said the goal is about more than simply getting rid of one agency or redirecting its duties to another. She pointed out that alongside ICE agents have been Border Patrol, FBI and ATF agents.

“A lot of folks forget that prison abolition is to completely abolish carceral systems. It comes from a Black tradition that says prison is a continuation of slavery,” she said.

But Peter Markowitz, a law professor and co-director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardozo School of Law, said the movement to abolish ICE around 2018 among mainstream politicians was always about having effective and humane immigration enforcement, not about having none.

“But it fizzled because it didn’t have an answer to the policy question that follows: If not ICE, then what?” he said. “I hope we’re in a different position today.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6316803/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6131x3219+0+436/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F72%2F14f965e74a87aa0f7516fba88748%2Fgettyimages-2256036466.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:02.249674

The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.","In November 2002, President George W. Bush signed a bill creating a federal agency devoted to protecting the United States. The country was still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, and the threat of international terrorism permeated public life.

Among the agencies that would be included in the Department of Homeland Security, as it would be called, would be Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — the parts of the government most responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws.

“The new department will analyze threats, will guard our borders and airports, protect our critical infrastructure, and coordinate the response of our nation for future emergencies,” Mr. Bush said at the time, adding that the department would “focus the full resources of the American government on the safety of the American people.”

But more than two decades later, as thousands of ICE and Border Patrol officers flood Minneapolis, some Democratic leaders say the department’s role appears to have strayed far from its original purpose, turning its tools of enforcement away from external threats and toward President Trump’s domestic critics.

They say enforcement has looked more like an occupation, as officers in helmets and tactical gear have faced off against hostile residents and left-wing protesters in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago and Washington. The interactions, broadcast to the world through social media videos filmed by protesters and federal agents alike, have given the impression of a government at war with the country’s own cities.

The Department of Homeland Security “was designed to protect Americans from threats, and what we’ve essentially done is, in some cases, we’ve turned that agency on Americans,” said Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland, Ore., a Democrat. “It’s deeply unsettling.”

Mr. Wilson said he was concerned that federal immigration enforcement activities could lead to a shooting like the one in Minneapolis that took the life of Renee Good, a 37-year-old protester fatally shot by an ICE officer. Hours after his comments, Border Patrol agents shot two Venezuelan nationals who had rammed their vehicle, the department said. The Venezuelans survived their injuries, and one was charged in connection with the incident.

More than two decades after its formation, the Department of Homeland Security is the government’s largest law enforcement agency, with around 250,000 employees. It includes many functions that are not directly part of the turmoil on the ground, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the agency that oversees airport security.

Yet even those agencies have come under pressure to meet Mr. Trump’s political objectives, with the airport security agency providing information to immigration agents and Mr. Trump trying to redirect disaster funding away from states not cooperating with his deportation goals.

ICE’s budget increased dramatically because of the sweeping domestic policy bill the president signed into law last July, making it the highest funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Under Mr. Trump, the department also redirected thousands of agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, a New York Times investigation found last year.

The Trump administration and officials in some of the targeted cities have used militaristic language to describe the conflict unfolding on the ground.

A lawsuit filed this week by Minnesota described the recent deployment of thousands of immigration agents and officers as “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities.”

“I see it as a personal militarized police force for the president to do his bidding against people who don’t see the world through the lens of the ultra rich,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, a Democrat.

Mr. Trump has recently raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to suppress rebellions and enforce federal laws. On Tuesday, he said on social media that Minnesotans should expect more action in their state, and that the “DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING.”

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has called Chicago a “war zone,” and said the agency had made parts of the city “much more free.” In recent weeks, the department has described Minnesota as a place where there was “rampant fraud and criminality happening.”

Mr. Bush at the time said that the United States would be better equipped to “reduce our vulnerability and, most important, prevent the terrorists from taking innocent American lives.”

Building the agency was a big task, with all or portions of 22 federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be folded into a single department. Some politicians in Washington initially resisted the creation of a new cabinet-level agency, including Mr. Bush.

Supporters of the department’s stepped-up role on immigration enforcement this year say the surge of officers in cities has made the country safer by rounding up violent criminals. They say voters endorsed decisive action on immigration when they elected Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized “sanctuary cities” that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He has pledged to be more aggressive.

“What these mayors are asking D.H.S. to do is not really an option,” said Chad Wolf, an acting homeland security secretary during the first Trump administration. “The majority of American people said, ‘We don’t want that America. We actually want criminal illegal aliens arrested and removed, as well as others.’”

Some law enforcement officials who have had productive relationships with federal authorities in the past have watched the new D.H.S. approach with concern.

“The biggest question that I’ve been receiving is: How will we intercede if there’s a conflict between community members and D.H.S.?” Shon Barnes, Seattle’s chief of police, said in an interview last fall. “Who will we side with? What will we do?”

The answer, Chief Barnes said, was that the department would “keep the peace.”

Jim McDonnell, the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said the city had long had close ties to D.H.S., in particular the agencies focused on criminal matters. But that cooperation became harder last summer, he said, when the agency launched a regionwide immigration operation that ensnared thousands of immigrants.

“This has been something very different — unprecedented — that we’ve seen here,” he said last year.

In many ways, Los Angeles was on the front line of the agency’s incursion into large, Democratic-led cities. Last June, following protests of an ICE operation in downtown Los Angeles, the agency empowered Border Patrol agents to lead immigration enforcement in the area.

Soon, agents were seen raiding carwashes, Home Depot parking lots and other locations. At one point, border agents traveled through a city park as a show of force. It was also the first time the National Guard had showed up to protect the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration work.

“The federal government invaded, intervened and created a problem, and then patted themselves on the back for so-called saving the city, when the city was never at risk of anything,” said Karen Bass, the city’s Democratic mayor.

The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.

When it was created, the agency was not just supposed to connect different parts of the federal government, but also expand its outreach to local and state entities.

Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.
Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office.
Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population.
Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.
Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts.","“They’re going to have to be really careful how they talk about this,” Laura Curran, a Democrat and former Nassau County executive, said of her party’s swing seat candidates. “We don’t want to talk about defunding the police or all that stuff.”

Proposals by Hochul and the Democratic-dominated state Legislature to put guardrails around Trump’s immigration tactics have not been enthusiastically received by vulnerable House Democrats.

Reps. Tom Suozzi and Josh Riley would not comment on the governor’s policy pushback, which she outlined in her State of the State speech this week. And a third Democrat, Rep. Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.

Efforts in Albany to check ICE’s actions are quickly becoming an issue in the three Democrats’ races as Trump moves to deport more undocumented immigrants and potentially use the Insurrection Act to quell adversarial protests. Republicans plan to mount competitive campaigns against Suozzi, Riley and Gillen this year with the goal of making in-roads among voters in purplish areas of New York state. Attacks over the governor’s immigration measures are already starting: A spokesperson for the House Republicans’ campaign arm accused Hochul and her fellow Democrats of trying to “reopen the illegal immigration floodgates.”

“New Yorkers haven’t forgotten what Democrats’ reckless open borders did to their state, and they won’t stand for it again,” said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O’Toole.

The stakes for New York Democrats to get the immigration policy right couldn’t be higher. Races in at least four seats in this deep blue state are expected to determine control of the House — and the course of Trump’s final two years in office.

Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office. GOP candidates hammered Democrats, regardless of what office they were running for, over a controversial law that restricted cash bail.

State-backed provisions that undermine federal law enforcement stand to serve as a replay of a fight that played out in several election cycles and led to electoral gains for Republicans.

Gillen’s office sidestepped questions about the Hochul-backed measures and instead called for action on the federal level.

“Our immigration system has been broken for decades and is in dire need of repair,” she said in a statement. “Comprehensive reform must be done at the federal level. Congress should pass my bipartisan Dignity Act to strengthen our border security, remove dangerous criminals, and provide a pathway for law-abiding immigrants to earn legal status.”

Curran, who led bellwether Nassau County for four years, believes Democrats in swing seats will have to remain cautious with calls to scale back ICE. But she acknowledged some voters want action following Good’s death and Trump’s threat of invoking the Insurrection Act amid ICE’s clashes with protesters. The fraught emotions have created a tricky balancing act for Democrats in tough races.

“The dramatic nature of all this ICE action is really starting to freak people out,” Curran said. “The popularity of Republicans is starting to go down if this escalates. This is going to become much more toxic, but I also understand why some of these Congressional Democrats are being vanilla. I understand these districts; they have to be.”

The lack of support for Hochul’s ICE-curbing plans among the trio of vulnerable New York Democrats underscores how Trump’s increasingly controversial deportation efforts continue to be a third rail for the party. Democrats have struggled to articulate an alternative plan and voters punished their candidates in 2024 as the president returned to the White House promising swift action.

But the expansive efforts to remove people from the country have changed how the party’s officials — especially at the state level — are approaching the issue.

Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population. Hochul wants to make it easier for New Yorkers to sue federal officials in state court and to require a judicial warrant before carrying out a civil deportation proceedings in locations like schools or houses of worship. Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.

The moderate Democrat in interviews has hammered ICE’s recent actions around the country, accusing the agency of abusing its power.

“It hurts peoples’ confidence in all law enforcement,” she told Fox 5. “This undermines the NYPD, and our state police, who are just doing their jobs.”

State lawmakers have proposed bills to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks while carrying out their official duties. They are calling for new monitoring requirements for ICE. And there are discussions to guarantee that every person facing civil deportation proceedings has access to an attorney.

“There’s a massive shift — including my own shift,” said Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy. “Public opinion has shifted dramatically.”

The Albany-area Democrat has worked with state lawmakers across the country in recent weeks to develop new legislation. Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts. She acknowledged, though, that some moderate Democrats are yet to come around amid uncertainty over how the rapidly changing events will shape the public’s view of the deportation crackdown.

“The marginal Democrats or the swing area Democrats are still nervous about it,” she said. “But now it’s more than an immigration issue. This is about who we are as Americans.”

Even among Democrats eager to put the brakes to ICE’s enforcement there are disagreements.

Hochul is typically cautious around controversial immigration issues — she is not embracing calls to expand sanctuary protections and said in a Fox 5 interview this week she does not want the agency abolished. But the governor received standing ovations from the audience when she laid out her immigration measures in her State of the State address — a speech given days after Good’s shooting in Minneapolis and an indication she is delicately threading a needle with her proposals.

“This doesn’t interfere with lawful enforcement or public safety,” Hochul said in the speech. “It simply affirms a core truth: Power does not justify abuse.”

There are signs voters across the country are becoming unnerved by immigration agents’ expansive tactics and deployments. A Quinnipiac University poll this week found 57 percent of voters disapproved of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws while 53 percent of those surveyed believe Good’s shooting was not justified.

Hochul has said she was “sickened” by Good’s death and called for “recourse” when a federal official acts inappropriately.

“Let’s start holding these people accountable,” she told MSNOW this month.

Her likely Republican opponent, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, has taken a starkly different posture.

Blakeman — who signed an executive order opposing sanctuary-related policies — told reporters this week he does not want to “put any shackles on ICE.” He said videos of Good appeared to show her turning her car toward an ICE agent and “trying to run down” the officer — a claim Hochul’s campaign rebuked. The Republican added that there should be more support for victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants.

“You want to talk about ICE? Let’s talk about the victims of crimes committed in New York state by the people who shouldn’t be here,” said Blakeman, who Republicans expect will have strong coattails in down-ballot Long Island races.

The differing views among Democrats over how to address Trump’s immigration actions highlights Hochul’s imperative to win over statewide voters, while swing seat incumbents must take a more careful approach, said independent political analyst J.C. Polanco.

“Hochul understands she’s never going to win a Blakeman voter,” he said. “Unfortunately for Gillen and Suozzi, they need Blakeman voters.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:20.729538

Jacob Ellis, an organizer of the protests, estimated there were twice the number of protesters than on a standard Saturday.

Recent warnings about Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents potentially conducting widespread action in Portland and Lewiston drew a crowd of about 200 people to Monument Square. On both sides of Congress Street, the majority of protesters held up signs against ICE, including “ICE is slippery and dangerous” and “crack ICE.”

While some have been protesting consistently, many demonstrators were there for the first time, compelled to participate because of the recent actions of ICE officers and the Trump administration.

Amara Aiken, 21, is one of them. Aiken said while it is always important for those with more privilege and power to stand up for those who are being targeted, it’s especially essential today.

After hearing about the recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer, Aiken said people are worried that something similar might happen in Portland. In a tight-knight community like Maine, Aiken said, people are concerned it could happen to someone they know.

“Everyone’s having that anxiety that ‘oh, my neighbor might be next, my friend might be next, my partner might be next,’” Aiken said.

Aiken is a manager in a taqueria, and when rumors started spreading about ICE in Portland, the owner and the management team established a protocol in the event that officers show up. They’ve decided they would ask the agents to leave and would refuse to serve them.

At the protest, a nurse gave a speech in front of the crowd, explaining that she has had conversations at work about what to do if ICE agents try to forcibly enter the doctor’s office.

Since hearing the rumors of ICE activity in Maine, many protesters said they have been trying to help out their neighbors and immigrants in their community, from sharing the number of the Maine ICE Watch Hotline to keeping track of where ICE officers might be located.

Jane Hoover, a retired nurse, said she has been involved in helping immigrants for years, from tutoring to helping provide shelter to attending the weekly protest whenever she can.

Hoover pointed sadly to a young girl standing on the sculpture in the middle of the square with a sign that read, “This is home. Why are we scared?”

The girl wasn’t the only one feeling scared. Protesters also said they felt sad, angry, disheartened and resigned. Some, like Nancy Anderson, still felt hopeful.

Anderson was glad to see new faces at the protest Saturday, including many young people. Anderson, who is 76 years old, said it crossed her mind that ICE officers might come to the protest, but there was no place she’d rather be than trying to defend democracy in the country for her four grandkids and help those at risk.

“Our Somali communities are vibrant and a gift to Maine, and people are coming together to do what is necessary to support them,” she said.

Ellis, the organizer, said he was encouraged by the number of people at the protest Saturday, although he is infuriated by the circumstances that necessitated the demonstration.

There will be another protest against ICE at 5 p.m. Sunday at Monument Square in coordination with other rallies across the country, he said.

“If there are any ICE agents reading this article, we do not want you here,” Ellis said. “You are not welcome here. You will never be welcome here.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/IMG_8651.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:24.790598

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.","After a federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with grisly videos quickly going viral on social media, news organizations from around the state, country and world dispatched correspondents and anchors to the scene.

In the days since, that media presence has ebbed and flowed – though a well-resourced local news corps and many national journalists have remained, including reporters for the Guardian, covering additional clashes between police and protesters.

Another shooting (of a man attempting to flee arrest, the government said) on Wednesday drew more coverage, and on Thursday a CNN crew was hit with projectiles while covering a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

While cuts and closures have thinned out local news reporting around the country, the Minneapolis media market remains strong, ensuring the shooting – and what has followed – have received robust coverage.

“I think we have the strongest media ecosystem of any city that’s parallel to our city,” said Matt Carlson, a Minneapolis-based professor of journalism for the University of Minnesota, mentioning the Star Tribune newspaper, Minnesota Public Radio, and smaller outlets such as the Sahan Journal, which covers immigrant communities, including the Somali refugee population that has come under attack from conservatives. (There’s also Alpha News, a conservative outlet that made headlines by publishing cell phone video taken by the ICE officer who killed Good.)

While there are always debates about national and international journalists parachuting in to cover catastrophes, “I think people in Minneapolis are actually excited to see national coverage of this, because we know that we can’t stop what’s happening by ourselves,” Carlson said.

He also predicted that Minneapolis will remain an epicenter of ICE activity and counter-protests, with Donald Trump recently threatening to invoke the Insurrection Action and send troops to the city.

“I would be very happy if the national news were able to leave because things have died down,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is not a case where things are dying down.”

Here are some of the journalists and newsroom leaders who have participated in coverage.

Omar Jimenez, anchor and correspondent, CNN

Jimenez, 32, came to the story last week with a lot of experience reporting in Minneapolis.

In May 2020, Jimenez was arrested live on CNN while covering protests in the city following the murder of George Floyd, which occurred just blocks away from where Good was killed.

While Jimenez’s team was quickly released, the incident made international headlines as an extraordinary incursion into the activities of journalists.

Since then, Jimenez has returned to the city multiple times for reporting trips. He said his antenna is always up for stories involving Minneapolis. So he flew to Minnesota a few hours after the shooting, arriving on the evening of 7 January and driving straight from the airport to the spot where Good was shot.

“When it became clear that obviously this was going to be as big as it has become, that’s when a manager of mine kind of walked in and said, ‘Hey, are you able to go to Minnesota as soon as possible?’” (He was only delayed, he said, because he needed to go home and get warmer clothes after seeing the weather forecast in Minnesota.)

During his reporting in Minneapolis last week, Jimenez said he met several people that he first encountered back in 2020.

“It’s a little bit of a balance in the sense that you obviously don’t want to be the story,” he said. “But I do think what you want is to try and be able to convey an authentic space, especially when you have the luxury of a camera. Even though everyone is seeing what you’re seeing, they’re not feeling it. There is a little bit of a barrier still. And so that’s why it is a constant balance of: ‘how close do we want to get?’”

Jimenez got pretty close to the action on 8 January, when CNN viewers watched him and his crew running away from law enforcement agents who had moved aggressively toward protesters after someone threw a water bottle at them.

While Jimenez is now back in New York City, he said: “I am not done with this story. I can tell you that.”

Kathleen Hennessey, editor and senior vice-president, Minnesota Star Tribune

A veteran of the Associated Press and the New York Times, Hennessey only took on the top editorial position at the newspaper (which was previously called the Minneapolis Star Tribune) last May. It’s fair to say that she’s been busy, considering the number of major stories that have happened in the state since then, including the June 2025 assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband.

“It’s been maybe busier, newsier than I expected to some degree, but it’s also been really rewarding to be at a place that feels so needed,” she said.

Hennessey’s newsroom of about 200 people has broken several major stories since the shooting, including being the first outlet to report the ICE officer’s name. That story drew a sharp rebuke from DHS press secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who called the outlet “reckless” and said it should “delete their story immediately” (it didn’t).

Hennessey said the decision to name the shooter (Jonathan Ross) was “a very deliberate, much-discussed decision” – but she added that it “wasn’t a particularly tough call”.

She said her news team had been “on edge and prepared and ready” for the Good story, considering the surge of deportation enforcement in recent weeks in the community.

“By this time, we feel pretty well practiced in sort of the quick mobilization of an all-hands-on-deck moment,” she said. “And so this was another one of those, really. Just about everybody immediately ran to their stations and did what they do.”

Considering how widely covered this story has been, “I encourage our newsroom to remember that nobody knows this place better than we do,” she said, “and nobody can be as close to the people involved, and be a more reliable source for people who actually live here.”

Unsurprisingly, Hennessey said the Star Tribune’s website has received a very large number of online readers over the last week and a half – though it’s a bit harder to net paying subscribers.

Going forward, she said she expects her newsroom to remain in overdrive covering the story. “It’s ongoing, it’s unfolding, and it feels very everywhere all at once,” she said. “At any given moment, there’s just a million videos popping up everywhere of incidents and encounters with ICE that feel newsworthy.”

Alex Tabet, political reporter, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC)

Tabet, who arrived in Minnesota at 1am on 7 January, made it to the scene of the shooting extremely quickly. He had already been tipped off by an ICE observer that there was an enforcement action going on in the neighborhood, and then got word that someone had been shot. It was his third reporting trip to Minnesota over the past month. “We were the first – at least – TV crew on the ground,” he said.

Tabet’s first call was to his network’s editorial leaders and standards officials, telling them, “Hey, this is what we know, this is what we don’t know,” he said. “And we started vetting all of the information that we had to try to figure out what is appropriate to put on air, what should we hold off on, basically making sure we had hit the threshold of understanding what was going on.”

Tabet, who left Minnesota on Tuesday after almost a full week, said he’s “hoping to go back as soon as possible” – though he said the network is well staffed on the story. The decision to leave “was a discussion between my bosses and I, because there’s only so many days [you can go] without sleep”.

“I know MS NOW is committed to having a strong presence on the ground, because they recognize how important of a story this is right now,” he said.

Megan Burks, deputy managing producer, MPR News (Minnesota Public Radio)

Burks, who coordinates daily news coverage for the NPR member station, said the newsroom had been settling into a new rhythm since the 7 January killing of Good. And then on Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg, leading to new protests and clashes with law enforcement.

“Just as it felt like we were settling into a manageable rhythm, this new twist came and now we’re back to trying to figure out what is our new normal, what is our new rhythm,” she said.

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.

“Knowing that we can’t focus on everything, we’re trying to let the audience drive some of what we choose to put our stamp on,” she said.

Nicole Sganga, homeland security correspondent, CBS News

Sganga arrived in Minneapolis two days before the shooting. She participated in a ride-along with immigration agents and interviewed Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, pressing her on how she can “justify” the government sending 2,000 DHS agents to the city.

In addition to reporting on the ground about Good’s killing, Sganga covered the intensification of immigration raids after the incident.

“My approach is always, ‘get there, bear witness, ask questions,’” Sganga said.

She said it’s been important to cover the story from Minneapolis to be able to press government officials on “contradictory accounts” of what happened and what is happening.

“That kind of independent reporting and verification is critical to holding power to account and to clarifying the facts for the public,” said Sganga, who has reported for the network for a decade.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db15c70b319ad3d587a5d51b7ccf3c7301280013/506_0_5055_4046/master/5055.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b91d9258b3d9dea6d35eeab10b3eab38",N,,2026-01-18 09:58:28.290296

The Next Century Foundation´s Research Officer, Olwyn Matthews, takes up the challenge:

Since its origins as the Brexit party in 2018, Reform UK has maintained a strong focus on immigration, Zia Yusuf (Head of Policy for Reform UK) naming UK return agreements for irregular or unauthorised migrants as the party’s “almighty foreign policy campaign”. Since the 2024 General Election, Reform UK’s primary policy document remains the party’s manifesto, “Our Contract With You”. Whilst Reform UK party members refer back to the core policies of this document, their ongoing discussion and media comments on foreign policy matters provide current insight into how a Reform UK government would approach foreign affairs.

Despite only having 5 MPs in the 650-seat House of Commons, Reform UK have topped recent opinion polls on voting intention in Parliament, reaching 31% in 2025. These results are far above the next contender, the Conservative party, with 18% voting intention. Polling offers a snapshot of voting decisions but makes the prospect of Reform UK success in the 2029 general election much more likely than in 2024.

Reform UK’s Approach to Foreign Affairs

With a populist party so focused on anti-migration and fuelling Euroscepticism, the increased probability of a successful campaign leaves many to question how a Reform government would approach foreign affairs. This is particularly relevant in an international arena with emerging populist parties favouring nationalism and the rejection of international community.

President Trump’s Administration

Reform UK’s approach to the US is mainly derived from Leader of Reform UK, the MP Nigel Farage’s public admiration for President Trump and their personal relationship. Generally, party members praise Trump’s administration, and it can be expected that their foreign policy would be closely aligned with Trump’s direction. Alan Mendoza, Reform UK foreign affairs advisor (Alan is also founder of the small right wing think tank, the Henry Jackson Society), has commended Trump’s “decisive” politics, particularly with regard to the Trump brokered Gaza Peace Plan of October 2025. In response to the recent US invasion of Venezuela, Farage commented the move by Trump was “contrary to international law”, but if it makes China and Russia “think twice, it may be a good thing”.

It is clear from Reform UK’s outlook on foreign affairs that its policy would follow a similar trajectory to the Trump administration. However, this personal relationship does not provide any clear foreign policy plan or confirm US support.

Israel

Reform UK has no clear policy on Israel or Palestine, but members of the party have shown strong support towards Israel. Farage has rejected the idea that the UK stop the arms supply to Israel and also opposes the arrest warrant for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC). MP Richard Tice, Deputy Leader of Reform UK has accused Tom Fletcher, UN humanitarian chief, of “lying with absurd claims” regarding the “UN’s genocide smears” against Israel.

The party itself has displayed support of Israel last year as it founded Reform Friends of Israel, joining similar groups such as Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) and Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), cementing even further their backing for the State of Israel. Both individual members and the party itself have been outspoken on its support for Israel and, even without an explicit policy, it can be expected that, if elected to office, a Reform government would back the state.

Palestine

With regard to Palestine, many members of the party, including Farage, Mendoza, and Tice have condemned the UK’s decision to recognise the Palestinian state in September 2025. 2023 London Mayoral candidate for Reform UK, Howard Cox, stated in a Reform UK press release, “flying the Palestinian flag in our Capital is needlessly provocative” and, “As London Mayor, I would not allow any pro-Palestinian protests to take place in London whilst the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues in Gaza.”

In response to President Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan announced in October 2025, Farage and Mendoza have publicly celebrated Trump’s “personal diplomacy and intervention”. To reach permanent peace in Gaza, Mendoza claims there are three issues that must be addressed: (i) the disarmament of Hamas and their removal from power, (ii) the governance of Gaza “free of terrorist control”, and (iii) the determination of who will enforce peace.

Russia and Ukraine

Farage has shown a mixed stance towards Russia and Ukraine over the years. Recently, the party has been under scrutiny as its former Welsh leader and Member of European Parliament, Nathan Gill, was jailed in November 2025 for taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia. In June 2024 Farage made comments implying that the Russian invasion was provoked by NATO advances. After criticism, he then called the invasion “immoral, outrageous, and indefensible”, but that “poking a bear is obviously not good foreign policy”. Despite his previous statements, which imply NATO expansionism is partly to blame for provoking the Russian invasion, Farage now views Ukraine joining NATO as “essential” to a peace deal.

On January 6th 2026, both Britain and France committed troops to Ukraine following the implementation of any peace deal. This was negatively received by Farage, claiming he would vote against sending British soldiers to Ukraine. The Reform leader argues Britain has neither the manpower nor the equipment to commit to an operation with an unknown timeline. This comment was made after 24 world leaders and Ukrainian allies making up the “coalition of the willing” discussed strategic plans post-peace deal.

Farage’s reluctance to send troops to Ukraine has been highlighted by cabinet minister Pat McFadden as a “pro-Russia” outlook, arguing that sending British troops is not just for Ukraine, but is a “British national security interest”. However, Mendoza argued Reform UK’s opposition to the Prime Minister’s Ukraine plans is not because the idea of sending British forces to Ukraine is the “wrong principle”, but that the plan itself is “unviable”. Moreover, Farage’s declaration that he would ensure the UK was a leading NATO force, alongside his recent support for Ukraine´s aspiration to become a NATO state, leaves one to assume that Farage would provide assistance to Ukraine as “once you’re a NATO member, you must be defended”. Reform voters on the other hand show scepticism in regard to the idea of sending British troops and only 4/10 voters are shown to favour the provision of arms to Ukraine.

The current reluctance from both Farage and the party’s voters introduces doubt as to how a Reform government would approach Putin´s Russia in the future and to what extent the party would utilise British forces.

Reflecting on Reform UK’s 2024 General Election Manifesto

“Our Contract With You” remains the most recent written document on Reform UK’s policy. The party’s foreign policy outlined in the document is extremely limited and vague, prioritising anti-immigration policy and arguably demonising foreigners and foreign influence.

Immigration

In 2025, the current Labour government announced their intent to extend the Indefinite Leave to Remain qualifying period from 5 to 10 years, presumed to enter into effect in April 2026. Reform UK’s migration policy sets to erase the Indefinite Leave to Remain status, replaced with a pathway by which migrants would be required to apply for a 5-year work visa. This would be a radical policy change. A salary threshold, at least £60,000 per year, would also be required, linking the number of dependents to the individual’s income, compared to the current (and already high) £41,700 per year requirement. This particular element of their policy would make little difference. If elected, Reform UK would prohibit anyone except British citizens from accessing welfare, raising questions as to the treatment of EU citizens with settled status who can acquire benefits outlined in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The party has also announced plans to implement an “immigration tax” which would increase the national insurance rate to 20% for migrant workers, deterring employees from hiring non-British citizens.

Defence

As part of the Brexit Policy, Reform UK’s Manifesto calls for the “Independence for Britain’s Armed Forces” from the EU Command and Control Force. This would involve abandoning current membership in the EU Horizon programme, stop any financial support of the European Defence Fund, and participation in the EU’s military mobility project.

Defence spending would be increased to 2.5% of the national GDP by Year 3, to 3% by Year 6. This is very similar when compared to Labour’s current spending of 2.5% national GDP in 2027, increasing from 2.3%. Reform UK calls to increase the size of Britain’s Armed Forces by 30,000 troops and to ensure a leadership position in NATO.

The introduction of the “Armed Forces Justice Bill” would “protect” servicemen and women “from civil law and human rights lawyers”. Presumably, this would allow British soldiers who have committed crimes overseas to escape any prosecution.

Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has shown mixed support of military intervention over the years, but based on opinion polls, Reform UK voters do not think an active role in foreign affairs is necessary. Less than half of Reform UK voters view this as extremely or very important, with 29% accepting that the UK consider the interests of allies.

Disengagement from International Institutions

What little foreign policy that there is in Reform UK’s Manifesto is limited to immigration, sparse defence policy, and the rejection of the international institutions with the planned exit from several conventions and agreements.

The Manifesto states intent to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – this is framed in the Manifesto and by Farage as a way to “stop the boats” that is argued to contribute to “uncontrolled Immigration”. If exiting the ECHR, the UK would join Russia and Belarus as the only states to have left or been expelled from the Convention. This would be followed with a replacement of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which authorises the ECHR into domestic UK law) with a “British Bill of Rights” which could involve the re-evaluation of the rights of UK citizens. The suggest altered policy regarding the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998 would presumably weaken or remove legal protections for asylum seekers and would re-shape the UK’s approach to settlement in the UK.

A UK departure from the ECHR would also impact the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which itself is under fire in the Manifesto which calls for a round of renegotiations, as it claims a “so-called EU ‘level playing field’ is holding us back”. As the party initially formed as the ‘Brexit Party’, the severing of ties with EU conventions and agreements is not at all surprising.

Climate Change Denial and goodbye to the ICC

Beyond these EU agreements, the manifesto pledges to withdrawal from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the eradication of any domestic and international goals to reach Net Zero. On Thursday 8th January, MP Richard Tice, Deputy Leader of Reform UK, echoed these plans, now calling for the UK to follow Trump’s move to quit the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the organisation that supports the annual COP climate conferences, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which Tice claims are “failing British voters”.

The disengagement with international agreements can also lead the assumption that Reform UK will very likely ignore any international law. Danny Kruger, Reform UK MP, declared in October 2025 that the party would rewrite UK’s ministerial code, a plan also stated in the party’s Manifesto. The ministerial code refers to “the overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations”. Kruger affirmed his “glaring objection” to this code “is that it requires them (the ministers) to acknowledge international law in their decision making. That is an immediate change we would make.” This change would allow or even be shown to encourage policymakers to act even more lawlessly.

This neglect of international law is further evident with the party’s dismissal of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to the Chagos deal. The Reform party has declared plans to cancel the current Labour government’s Chagos deal, signed in May 2025. This deal agrees upon the transfer of sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after people were removed from the territory by the UK in the 1970’s to claim the land for a US military base. Farage argues that giving up Diego Garcia in particular – the largest island crucial for US/UK military interventions – is “the single most important thing that we give America right now”, and this ‘loss’ plays “into China’s hands”.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) published their advisory opinion, demanding the UK cease control over the Chagos Islands and relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius. Farage has dismissed this as “an advisory judgement from the International Criminal Court has no force of legal power whatsoever; indeed, America disregards it so much that it is not even a member.” The UK’s exit from any of these institutions, and lack of participation in the international arena would lose any leadership position the UK may have on the international stage.

Reducing Foreign Aid

Reform UK stated in the run up to the 2024 General Election that it would slash “wasteful” spending, one example being the cutting of foreign aid by 50%. More recently, Reform UK has announced plans to limit foreign aid much further to £1 billion, a decrease from the £14 billion budget in 2024. Approximately £750 million of this sum would be spent to maintain membership of international organisations such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, allocating the rest for “genuine disaster relief”.

This was renounced by Gideon Rabinowitz, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Bond, arguing that such a vast cut in foreign aid would cause “irreversible damage to the UK’s safety net” in an “increasingly unstable world”. With the reduced contributions to international organisations, there would be extreme risk of losing influence in these spaces of international collaboration. A relation can be made to the Trump administration’s “slash and burn” approach to government financing, with the closure of USAID in 2025 felt across the globe.

Conclusion

Reform UK maintains a focus purely on the ‘national interest’, with a lack of appetite to support international causes. Reform UK voters continue to hold more nationalistic views on foreign policy compared to other voters, with a lower level of approval for British action overseas. Generally, with a future Reform UK government, one could expect nationalist, Trump-aligned policy on migration, higher defence spending, slashing ties to international partners, and decreasing foreign aid.

Several South Asian civil rights and advocacy organizations are condemning the U.S. State Department’s decision to suspend immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, a move scheduled to take effect Jan. 21, calling on President Donald Trump to immediately rescind what they describe as discriminatory measures.

The South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation said the policy unfairly penalizes people from the South Asian subcontinent, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, and undermines principles of equity, family unity and human dignity.

Rittu Kumar, president of the South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation, said the organization views the policy as discriminatory in both impact and intent.

“The South Asian communities have long contributed to the social, cultural, academic, and economic fabric of the United States. Policies that single out entire nations and populations for exclusion, under the guise of security or administrative efficiency, perpetuate harmful stereotypes, fuel xenophobia, and punish individuals based on nationality rather than any individualized assessment,” Kumar said.

Asked about data on how many South Asians could be affected and whether the group plans legal action, Kumar told indica the foundation is monitoring developments but does not plan to file a lawsuit.

“I do not have any data available for how many South Asians would be impacted and we do not intend to file a lawsuit. We will be keeping a close watch regarding the changing landscape affecting immigration rights, and reaffirm our commitment to advocating for an immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect,” Kumar said.

In its statement, the South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation rejected the administration’s rationale for the suspension and criticized what it described as a broader pattern of restrictive immigration policies.

“We reject the false narrative that immigration from South Asia, and other named countries, poses a threat to the United States. History and evidence show the opposite, inclusive immigration policies strengthen communities, foster innovation, and uphold democratic values,” the statement said. “This announcement and other country-specific immigration restrictions that the Trump administration has enacted in the last 12 months are a modern version of xenophobic U.S. immigration policies and seek to reverse decades of legal immigration to the United States. Blanket bans and pauses erode trust in government and damage the nation’s moral standing.”

The organization called on the federal government to reverse course.

“The SABA North America calls on the U.S. government to immediately rescind these discriminatory measures, restore fair and timely visa processing, and pursue immigration policies grounded in justice, transparency, and due process,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with South Asian communities in the United States and abroad, as well as all affected individuals and communities, and reaffirm our commitment to advocating for an immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect, regardless of where they come from.”

Other civil rights organizations also voiced strong opposition. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the suspension would have sweeping consequences for immigrant families and communities of color.

“The Trump administration’s sweeping decision to indefinitely suspend immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries is a cruel, unjustified and bigoted policy that undermines American values and divides American families from their relatives overseas,” the group said. The organization said the policy disproportionately targets majority Black, Brown and Global South nations, including many Muslim-majority countries.

Asian Americans Advancing Justice said the decision represents one of the most restrictive immigration actions in decades and likened it to earlier racially discriminatory policies.

“This new policy constitutes one of the most restrictive attacks on the immigration system that our nation has seen in decades,” the organization said. “It blocks hundreds of thousands of people from immigration pathways established by Congress and harkens back to the racially discriminatory immigration restrictions of the 1920s that effectively barred Asian and Black immigrants.”

The group said the suspension would separate families and block workers who have followed existing legal pathways to permanent residence.

“The pause disproportionately targets immigrants of color, yet another indication of the xenophobia and racism driving this administration’s policies,” the organization said. “Asian Americans will suffer under this pause, with 44% of Asian immigrant visa holders, and over 135,000 individuals, barred.”

Asian Americans Advancing Justice also disputed the State Department’s justification for the policy.

“The State Department has justified this action based on supposed concerns about public benefit usage by immigrants. This is a blatant lie,” the organization said. “Various rules already restrict the ability of immigrant visa recipients to qualify for public benefits. Moreover, countless studies have shown that immigrants enhance economic growth, and that access to public benefits leads to better long-term outcomes for children, families and society.”

The organization urged the administration and Congress to reverse the suspension and pursue broader immigration reform.

“Policymakers should expand access to immigration and address root causes of poverty and displacement with dignity, not exclusion,” it said. “We call on the administration to immediately reverse this decision and work with Congress to improve, and not curtail, our immigration system.”",https://indicanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pexels-n-voitkevich-7235892.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 12:59:29.409872

The president hit the ground running last January, issuing a flurry of executive orders, including pardons for most Jan. 6 defendants and the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk’s effort to slash the federal government.

One year on, Mr. Musk is long gone, as is DOGE. And the impact of President Trump’s ambitious and aggressive efforts to reshape policy – indeed, America itself – is coming into focus. He has pushed the envelope on presidential power, issuing more executive orders in his first year back than in his entire first term. He has bypassed Congress and challenged the courts, invaded Venezuela and arrested its leader, exacted retribution on his perceived enemies, and transformed the White House itself with golden decor and a big planned ballroom.

Mr. Trump’s second term makes the first term look like a dress rehearsal. It’s almost as if he spent his first four years in office figuring out how much power he had, and came back determined to use every bit of it.

Fifty years from now, will historians be calling Mr. Trump a “transformational president”? Or will this period ultimately seem like a lot of tumult that added up to little long-term change? Likely both. Every president leaves a stamp on the office and the country. As always, the challenge is to separate the signal from the noise.

Mr. Trump has made plenty of promises (or threats) that have gone nowhere – from claiming he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours to saying he would turn the Gaza Strip into a luxury tourist destination.

But in many ways, Mr. Trump has already changed the United States profoundly, including its role in the world, in ways that may have lasting impact.

A timeline at the bottom of this article charts major presidential events this past year.

More stories on President Trump’s second term after one year:

• On the economy, no recession, but no boom either

• Shattering foreign policy norms

• Battling universities over antisemitism and DEI

America’s image in Europe as a steady ally has been torpedoed, as made clear in the president’s new National Security Strategy, which lauds Europe’s “patriotic” – i.e., nationalistic – parties. Mr. Trump’s new tariff regime has upended global trade, while his crackdown on illegal immigration cut off the flow of migrants at the border and sparked major unrest in Minneapolis.

He’s also shrunk and reshaped parts of the U.S. government, including eliminating “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as a priority. The departments and agencies that Mr. Trump gutted, such as the Education Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be hard to reconstitute, even if a future president wants to do so. In all this, and perhaps most important, he has reset the bar for using executive power.

“Previous presidents have been criticized for using executive orders and trying to act unilaterally, but he’s taken it to a different level,” says Matthew Dickinson, a presidential scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. “It’s going to be hard to put that genie back in the bottle.”

In a year of upheaval, one notable aspect of Trump 2.0 has been the loyalty and stability of his team. Unlike Year 1 of his first term, when the president rapidly cycled through top aides in key spots – including his chief of staff, press secretary, and chief political strategist – this year has seen little staff turnover. “Let Trump be Trump” appears to be the guiding philosophy of Term 2.

Looking ahead, Mr. Trump’s power might get a real check after the fall midterm elections, if Democrats retake the House of Representatives. Signs of “lame duckery” are already appearing, as some Republicans start pushing back on his policies and approach. Still, he has a year to go with the current Congress – and that’s a lifetime in Trump time.

On immigration, big goals and big controversy

In Year 1, President Trump oversaw an avalanche of anti-immigrant policies – while creating exceptions for some immigrants who are white or rich. From borderlands to urban centers, his administration targeted illegal immigration and lawful pathways alike. He condemned many migrants, generally, as criminals. He called some, specifically, “garbage.”

Invoking a rare wartime law – and disputed gang ties – the Department of Homeland Security sent more than 100 Venezuelans to a notorious Salvadoran prison in March. A federal judge has asked the administration to address due process violations, while the government dismisses former detainees’ claims of abuse.

The president kept campaign promises as he sought to “seal” the southern border. Border Patrol apprehensions, a proxy for illegal crossings, sank to their lowest level since 1970. A surge of armed forces to the border included the creation of new military zones. In the interior, controversial waves of immigrant arrests – many targeting people without criminal records – at times ensnared U.S. citizens. Even as the administration withholds certain data, it reports deporting over 600,000 people. Mr. Trump also limited legal immigration, including of refugees, while prioritizing Afrikaners from South Africa. As foreigners from 39 countries face entry bans, Mr. Trump is offering “gold card” residency for $1 million per person.

Heading into Year 2, polling suggests the public has soured on his immigration agenda. An immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month has also sparked protests there and nationwide.

What to watch: whether the Supreme Court lets the president end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship.

Steering a new direction on social issues

President Trump has taken a number of steps in office aimed at defeating “woke” ideology – including dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that he said illegally discriminated against white people.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing government agencies and departments to terminate all DEI offices and positions, “equity action” plans, and DEI performance requirements.

This order was a direct response to the first executive order President Joe Biden signed after his own inauguration, instructing agency heads to assess the equity of agency policies and actions. Another Trump executive order rescinded affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI mandates in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.

In response, major U.S. companies from Walmart to Meta scrapped diversity goals and training programs. And hundreds of colleges and universities have ended programs that promoted DEI on campus or focused on LGBTQ+ or minority students.

Mr. Trump moved to undo protections for transgender people, making it federal policy to recognize only two genders and rescinding federal funds from schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. After Mr. Trump revoked Mr. Biden’s executive order that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military, the Department of Defense issued a ban on transgender service members, which the Supreme Court has upheld. His Department of Health and Human Services in December proposed a sweeping set of new rules that would dramatically restrict access to gender-transition treatments for minors.

Mr. Trump has also tried to shift American culture in a more conservative direction. He has instructed the Smithsonian museums to root out what he calls anti-American propaganda in their exhibits. He took over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, appointing a new board that tapped him as its chair, eliminating “woke” programming, and adding his name to the building’s exterior.

Justice as retribution?

The first year of this second Trump administration has challenged long-standing norms in the criminal justice system. Having criticized the justice system as unfairly targeting him, Mr. Trump appears to be trying to use the system in a similar fashion.

He has pushed for prosecutions of his political adversaries and issued pardons for allies. He has personally criticized lower court judges who ruled against his administration, while one of his top aides has railed against “judicial tyranny.” Presidents have traditionally refrained from direct criticism like this out of respect for the judiciary’s independence and to uphold public confidence in the courts. Amid Mr. Trump’s attacks, violent threats against federal judges rose.

In September, Mr. Trump called for two adversaries – former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James – to be prosecuted. Indictments quickly followed – against Mr. Comey on charges of lying to Congress, and against Ms. James on charges of mortgage fraud. Both deny the charges, and both cases have since been dismissed on procedural grounds. In January, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that he was being investigated for allegedly lying to Congress. The investigation is a pretext, Mr. Powell said, for not acquiescing to Mr. Trump’s demands to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies. On his first day in office, he issued pardons to more than 1,500 people convicted or charged for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including hundreds charged with violent felonies.

A chain saw, but DOGE doesn’t meet its target

Remaking the federal bureaucracy began on President Trump’s first day in office, when he created the Department of Government Efficiency. Under the leadership of Mr. Trump’s billionaire benefactor Elon Musk, DOGE became synonymous with the president’s effort to dislodge what he calls the “deep state” and slash a “bloated” federal government. Mr. Musk set a goal of cutting $2 trillion from the country’s $7 trillion budget. By its own accounting, DOGE – which disbanded eight months ahead of schedule – only achieved about 10% of its cost-cutting goal; media investigations and conservative think tanks suggest the true savings were roughly half that, at best.

Still, cuts were widespread across the government. According to data released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in January, more than 322,000 federal employees have left the government since January 2025, either through layoffs or after taking buyouts. But some agencies also rehired workers, either out of necessity or because of court rulings, leading to an overall workforce cut of roughly 220,000 employees, or a 10% reduction. This falls short of Mr. Trump’s stated goal of four reductions for every new hire, and is less than President Bill Clinton’s federal workforce cut of about 17% in the 1990s.

The cuts varied across the government, with some agencies and departments harder hit than others. The U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered almost entirely, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities was cut by more than 50%, and the Department of Education by more than 40%. The Departments of the Treasury, Agriculture, State, and Health and Human Services each lost around 20% of their workforces. The Department of Defense, on the other hand, only fell by 8%.

Beyond the current cuts, workers and experts fear that the administration’s attacks on federal workers may damage future recruitment. Mr. Trump also signed executive orders to allow for more politically appointed positions – a “sharp departure,” says Rachel Augustine Potter, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, from “the meritocratic foundations of the U.S. bureaucracy.” If courts uphold these changes, she writes, it could make it difficult for America to return to a less politicized, expertise-based civil service.

A federal judge has asked the administration to address due process violations, while the government dismisses former detainees’ claims of abuse.

The president kept campaign promises as he sought to “seal” the southern border. Border Patrol apprehensions, a proxy for illegal crossings, sank to their lowest level since 1970. A surge of armed forces to the border included the creation of new military zones. In the interior, controversial waves of immigrant arrests – many targeting people without criminal records – at times ensnared U.S. citizens. Even as the administration withholds certain data, it reports deporting over 600,000 people. Mr. Trump also limited legal immigration, including of refugees, while prioritizing Afrikaners from South Africa. As foreigners from 39 countries face entry bans, Mr. Trump is offering “gold card” residency for $1 million per person.

Heading into Year 2, polling suggests the public has soured on his immigration agenda. An immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month has also sparked protests there and nationwide.

What to watch: whether the Supreme Court lets the president end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship.

Steering a new direction on social issues

President Trump has taken a number of steps in office aimed at defeating “woke” ideology – including dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that he said illegally discriminated against white people.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing government agencies and departments to terminate all DEI offices and positions, “equity action” plans, and DEI performance requirements.

This order was a direct response to the first executive order President Joe Biden signed after his own inauguration, instructing agency heads to assess the equity of agency policies and actions. Another Trump executive order rescinded affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI mandates in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.

In response, major U.S. companies from Walmart to Meta scrapped diversity goals and training programs. And hundreds of colleges and universities have ended programs that promoted DEI on campus or focused on LGBTQ+ or minority students.

Mr. Trump moved to undo protections for transgender people, making it federal policy to recognize only two genders and rescinding federal funds from schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. After Mr. Trump revoked Mr. Biden’s executive order that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military, the Department of Defense issued a ban on transgender service members, which the Supreme Court has upheld. His Department of Health and Human Services in December proposed a sweeping set of new rules that would dramatically restrict access to gender-transition treatments for minors.

Mr. Trump has also tried to shift American culture in a more conservative direction. He has instructed the Smithsonian museums to root out what he calls anti-American propaganda in their exhibits. He took over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, appointing a new board that tapped him as its chair, eliminating “woke” programming, and adding his name to the building’s exterior.

Justice as retribution?

The first year of this second Trump administration has challenged long-standing norms in the criminal justice system. Having criticized the justice system as unfairly targeting him, Mr. Trump appears to be trying to use the system in a similar fashion.

He has pushed for prosecutions of his political adversaries and issued pardons for allies. He has personally criticized lower court judges who ruled against his administration, while one of his top aides has railed against “judicial tyranny.” Presidents have traditionally refrained from direct criticism like this out of respect for the judiciary’s independence and to uphold public confidence in the courts. Amid Mr. Trump’s attacks, violent threats against federal judges rose.

In September, Mr. Trump called for two adversaries – former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James – to be prosecuted. Indictments quickly followed – against Mr. Comey on charges of lying to Congress, and against Ms. James on charges of mortgage fraud. Both deny the charges, and both cases have since been dismissed on procedural grounds. In January, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that he was being investigated for allegedly lying to Congress. The investigation is a pretext, Mr. Powell said, for not acquiescing to Mr. Trump’s demands to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies. On his first day in office, he issued pardons to more than 1,500 people convicted or charged for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including hundreds charged with violent felonies.

A chain saw, but DOGE doesn’t meet its target

Remaking the federal bureaucracy began on President Trump’s first day in office, when he created the Department of Government Efficiency. Under the leadership of Mr. Trump’s billionaire benefactor Elon Musk, DOGE became synonymous with the president’s effort to dislodge what he calls the “deep state” and slash a “bloated” federal government. Mr. Musk set a goal of cutting $2 trillion from the country’s $7 trillion budget. By its own accounting, DOGE – which disbanded eight months ahead of schedule – only achieved about 10% of its cost-cutting goal; media investigations and conservative think tanks suggest the true savings were roughly half that, at best.

Still, cuts were widespread across the government. According to data released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in January, more than 322,000 federal employees have left the government since January 2025, either through layoffs or after taking buyouts. But some agencies also rehired workers, either out of necessity or because of court rulings, leading to an overall workforce cut of roughly 220,000 employees, or a 10% reduction. This falls short of Mr. Trump’s stated goal of four reductions for every new hire, and is less than President Bill Clinton’s federal workforce cut of about 17% in the 1990s.

The cuts varied across the government, with some agencies and departments harder hit than others. The U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered almost entirely, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities was cut by more than 50%, and the Department of Education by more than 40%. The Departments of the Treasury, Agriculture, State, and Health and Human Services each lost around 20% of their workforces. The Department of Defense, on the other hand, only fell by 8%.

Beyond the current cuts, workers and experts fear that the administration’s attacks on federal workers may damage future recruitment. Mr. Trump also signed executive orders to allow for more politically appointed positions – a “sharp departure,” says Rachel Augustine Potter, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, from “the meritocratic foundations of the U.S. bureaucracy.” If courts uphold these changes, she writes, it could make it difficult for America to return to a less politicized, expertise-based civil service.

The latest incident comes amid heightened tensions in the city in Minnesota state following the fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent earlier this month.

Demonstrators chanting against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol gathered near City Hall and quickly pressed the rival group toward a municipal building before forcing them to retreat to a nearby hotel.

Water balloons and snowballs were thrown at the right-wing demonstrators in weather that reached -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police kept their distance and no serious injuries were reported.

Who is behind the pro-ICE rally?

Right-wing influencer Jake Lang, who organized the pro-ICE rally, later claimed on social media he was stabbed, but Minneapolis police said no report was filed and they received no injury complaints.

Lang is one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by US President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6, 2021, riot on the US Capitol. He faced multiple charges, including assaulting a police officer with a baseball bat.

The right-wing social media personality, who recently announced plans to run for US Senate in Florida, is known for making anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments.

Ahead of his appearance, Lang had posted on social media that he intended to ""burn a Quran"" on the steps of City Hall. It did not appear that he actually burnt a copy of the Muslim holy book.

Pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis have often targeted the Somali immigrant population in Minneapolis, most of whom ⁠are Muslim.

""We're out here to show Nazis and ICE and DHS and MAGA you are not welcome in Minneapolis,"" protester Luke Rimington told AP news agency. ""Stay out of our city, stay out of our state. Go home.""

Minnesota's leadership at odds with Trump

Trump has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area, citing alleged misuse of federal funds and singling out the state's Somali immigrant community.

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz has mobilized the National Guard to support law enforcement in the state, officials said in a statement.

The state's Democratic leadership has clashed with the Trump administration over the crackdown, with the Justice Department opening an investigation into Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying they have impeded federal immigration enforcement through their public statements.

Meanwhile, a US judge restricted federal agents on Friday from interfering with peaceful protesters, even as Trump backed away from a threat of invoking the Insurrection Act over the demonstrations.

Karmel Mall in south Minneapolis contains more than a hundred small businesses in suites offering everything from clothing and food to insurance and accounting services. On Thursday, the noisy hallways inside lay quiet, save for occasional chatter between neighboring vendors. The smell of fried food still wafted from the bakeries, the central heating hummed and the sound of Quran recitation flowed quietly from some shops.

But many sellers sat alone in their clothing stores, waiting for the occasional customer to walk by. Everyone is afraid of federal immigration agents, business owners said. Sellers and customers, citizens and noncitizens. Some don’t bother opening shop because they aren’t expecting any customers.

“It’s been like this for three weeks now,” said Abdi Wahid, who works at his mom’s convenience store in the mall. “Everywhere it’s all been closed up, all the stores.”

Karmel Mall is an economic hub for the area’s Somali population, which is the largest in the U.S. But it also features housing, a mosque and Quran classes, serving as a robust community center for the area.

The economic impact of the Trump administration's “Operation Metro Surge” stretches beyond the Somali community: many immigrants are on edge, afraid to go to work or leave their homes amid the immigration crackdown.

But President Donald Trump has made the Somali community a special target of his deportation rhetoric after a recent government fraud case in Minnesota included a number of Somali defendants. Since December, Trump has made numerous jabs at the community, calling them “garbage” and saying “they contribute nothing.""

Wahid said early afternoons at the family business once meant 15 to 20 customers. These days, it’s tough to get one.

Wahid is a citizen, but he said the fear extends beyond just immigrants. Citizens are also scared of coming in, especially following the killing of Renee Good and the ICE raid at Roosevelt High School in south Minneapolis.

“I think that caused a lot of people to not even want to come,” he said, because they could be targeted “just because of their race.”

Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that law enforcement uses “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests under the fourth amendment.

“A person’s immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity,” she said.

Upstairs, Bashir Garad runs Safari Travel & Accounting Services. Not only has the crackdown in Minneapolis meant he's lost almost all his customers, but his existing clients are cancelling upcoming trips because they’re worried they won’t be let back into the country.

“They see a lot of unlawful things going on in the city,"" he said. “They look at something bad, and then they think some bad things may happen to them.” The majority of his clients are East African, and nearly all are U.S. citizens. They still hesitate to travel.

“The government is not doing the right thing,” he said. “If there’s a criminal, there’s a criminal. Regardless, there are ways to find the criminal, but to marginalize the community’s name, and a whole people, that is unlawful.”

Ibrahim Dahiye, who sells electronics, said winter always used to be slow, “but now it’s totally different. No one comes here. All the stores are closed, few are open.”

Since the crackdown began, Dahiye said his business is down $20,000 monthly, and he’s now pooling funds to make rent.

He said he's lost most of his customers. His employees are too scared to come to work. He tapped his jacket pocket, saying he keeps his passport on him at all times.

“I don’t know what we can do,” Dahiye said. “We believe in Allah, but we can’t do anything.”",https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:35.061188

Five hours away at the Fort Benning U.S. Army base, near Columbus, ICE conducts more specialized tactical training for its elite units.
As ICE’s special response teams have expanded, so has its programming at the military base.
To train its sniper teams and special response groups, ICE has also inked deals with military contractors and obscure security firms.
“Target Down Group is honored to have provided training to them in order to assist them [sic] perform their duties.” The other ICE training contractors mentioned in this story did not respond to inquiries, nor did ICE.","Over the past six months, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever, a variety of shadowy private security and weapons firms have been tapped to provide firearms and combat training to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) snipers and special response teams — several of which had never before received any federal contracts.

Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed 37-year-old legal observer Renee Good in Minnesota last week, was a 10-year veteran of an ICE special response team, the agency’s equivalent of a SWAT team. Good’s killing has sparked nationwide unrest and scrutiny of ICE’s increasingly violent tactics.

The firms that have won valuable contracts under the Trump administration to train officers like Ross include a Texas armed security company, a politically connected sniper firm in Florida, and a shadowy tactical training company in Virginia. One, Target Down Group, is owned by the brother of Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), as Wired reported in September.

These firms are among the many private entities, alongside private prison companies and social media surveillance firms, lining up for their cut of the Trump administration’s deportation spending blitz, which nearly tripled ICE’s annual budget with the enactment of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

ICE’s workforce has ballooned by 120 percent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration amid an unprecedented hiring frenzy. The agency has slashed its training requirements and loosened hiring standards to hire as many new recruits as possible.

The new contracts with little-known companies that advertise training in “advanced techniques once exclusive to military protection units,” are another window into the ongoing militarization of ICE, a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security.

ICE has long deployed tanks and specialized tactical units in the course of immigration enforcement. But the agency is now spending more than ever before on munitions and military equipment to outfit its officers. The consequences of this spending spree, in the view of many people who have taken to the streets in Minneapolis and around the country, were seen in the killing of Good and, a day later, the shooting of two people during a traffic stop by ICE.

A Bloomberg report last month found that ICE spent nearly $140 million on weapons and ammunition in the final weeks of the 2025 fiscal year, buying from some vendors that had previously worked primarily with the Pentagon. (A single vendor, Lionheart Alliance, received a $49 million contract last month to provide tactical gear like ballistic helmets to ICE.)

Most new ICE recruits go through several weeks of routine training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. Five hours away at the Fort Benning U.S. Army base, near Columbus, ICE conducts more specialized tactical training for its elite units. As ICE’s special response teams have expanded, so has its programming at the military base.

ICE also rents firing ranges around the country for its agents; ICE spends the second-highest amount of money on gun-range contracts in Minnesota, behind Texas.

ICE’s training methods at Fort Benning have come under scrutiny before. In 2019, under the first Trump administration, the agency inked a contract with military contractor Strategic Operations, Inc. to build out its “tactical operations complex” at the military base, including a “hyper realistic” replica of a home in Arizona and an apartment complex in Chicago in order to train its agents for supposed “urban warfare.”

Strategic Operations, Inc. received a subsequent $975,000 contract from ICE in 2024 for another “modular training structure” at Fort Benning, procurement records show.

Already, since Sept. 1, 2025, ICE has spent nearly $8 million on new equipment — including simulation rounds, junk cars, sniper training gear, and a model building — for various training courses, including for its tactical training at Fort Benning, per The Lever’s review of contracting records.

To train its sniper teams and special response groups, ICE has also inked deals with military contractors and obscure security firms.

In July, ICE awarded a first-time, $23,000 contract to Reticence Group LLC, a Texas-based armed security firm, for “specialized law enforcement pistol and rifle” training. The company, led by two SWAT officers in Texas, advertises that it offers “covert and confidential armed security contractors” for the private sector, as well as “firearms training that pushes limits.”

Another sole source contract in July for $35,000 was awarded to Path Consulting LLC, a Virginia Beach-based firm that, according to a contract notice, provides “[close-quarter combat] live fire training” and would help an ICE special response team “develop new standard operating procedures.”

Although the contract notice indicated that Path Consulting LLC had worked with ICE in the past, no other online procurement records mention its name. A call to a phone number linked to the company went unanswered.

In September, ICE issued a no-bid contract to Target Down Group, a company owned by Dan LaLota, the brother of Nick LaLota, who has served as the Republican U.S. Representative for New York’s 1st congressional district since 2023. (Dan LaLota denied his brother had any role in the award when asked by Wired in September.) Most of Target Down Group’s leadership are veterans of the U.S. special forces; the company’s president, Dan LaLota, is a former U.S. Marine.

The company’s website advertises “elite firearms instruction,” drawing from “years of experience as veterans from U.S. Military Special Operations.” In the Department of Homeland Security’s September justification for the no-bid contract, officials wrote that ICE had an “immediate requirement to procure precision fires and specialized observation capabilities for the national Special Response Team (SRT) sniper program.”

“The law enforcement officers of ICE have a very challenging job to conduct,” LaLota wrote in response to The Lever’s request for comment. “Target Down Group is honored to have provided training to them in order to assist them [sic] perform their duties.”

Kaden Rummler said in an interview that he was in agonizing pain and underwent an extensive six-hour surgery to his left eye after he was injured at a Jan. 9 protest over the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Rummler said he has no depth perception and can no longer drive. Shards of metal and a nickel-sized piece of plastic remain lodged in his skull, his attorney said, and he is considering suing.

""It's going to affect every aspect of my life,"" said Rummler, who hopes to pursue a career in forestry.

A second demonstrator at the same protest outside a federal immigration building in Santa Ana told the Los Angeles Times he was also blinded in one eye by a projectile fired by federal agents. Britain Rodriguez, 31, said he was standing on steps outside the immigration building when he was struck in the face.

""I remember hitting the ground and feeling like my eye exploded in my head,"" Rodriguez told the newspaper.

The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press about what type of projectile was used. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the agency, said in an emailed statement this week that the protesters were violent and that two officers were injured but didn't specify the extent of their injuries. DHS said one demonstrator was taken to the hospital with a cut. McLaughlin confirmed to the Times that was a reference to Rummler and called his injury claims ""absurd.""

Rummler has been charged with a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. One of his fellow protesters was jailed for several days and has been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer.

Rummler's attorney John Washington said doctors want to know whether the materials in the projectile could be toxic but have been unable to get answers from DHS. Washington said based on their preliminary investigation they believe it was a capsule made from metal and plastic containing pepper spray.

The injuries in California are the latest in a growing number of violent encounters between federal agents and community members during protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Federal immigration agents deployed to Minneapolis have used aggressive crowd-control tactics that have become a dominant concern after the deadly shooting of Renee Good.

In Santa Ana, hundreds of people marched in the streets on Jan. 9 to protest Good's killing. A smaller group later congregated outside the federal immigration building, shouting expletives through megaphones about ICE, according to video taken by OC Hawk, a group that films breaking news in Orange County.

The video shows a handful of officers in riot gear standing guard and urging demonstrators to move back. An orange cone is later seen rolling onto a plaza outside the building, and authorities begin firing crowd-control projectiles as they walk toward the crowd.

In the video, an officer is seen grabbing a protester by the arm and Rummler and a few others are seen stepping forward shouting in response. An officer then fires a crowd-control weapon, striking Rummler from several feet away. Rummler grabs his face and falls to the ground, and an officer grabs him by the shirt and drags him backward across the ground toward the building, the video shows. Later, video appears to show him face down on the ground being handcuffed.

Rummler said he joined the protest against immigration authorities because he can't stand seeing families torn from their homes. Despite his injuries, he said he would do it again.

""I refuse to sit around idly and watch that happen, and in 50 years, I would absolutely regret not trying to make a change,"" he said.

Washington, a civil rights lawyer, said his client could have been killed.

""Any officers with just the most basic training would know you don't shoot someone ever in the face with this, but let alone at point-blank range, and that's because it is a lethal weapon when used like that, and it very nearly was,"" Washington said.

Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of South Carolina, said a thorough investigation is needed into the reason for using a high level of force in that situation.

Chevron deference and Loper Bright: Chevron required courts (in many circumstances) to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.
Conclusion The Second Circuit’s disposition in Hinds v. Bondi reinforces two practical rules in immigration litigation.","1. Introduction

Hinds v. Bondi (2d Cir. Jan. 16, 2026) is a nonprecedential summary order reviewing a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) that (1) sustained removability and (2) affirmed the Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) discretionary denial of cancellation of removal.

The petitioner, Devon Alexander Hinds, a lawful permanent resident and native and citizen of Barbados, pleaded guilty on July 15, 2021 to New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) (endangering the welfare of a child). DHS charged him as removable for a “crime of child abuse” under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The IJ ordered removal and denied cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion; the BIA affirmed.

The petition raised two core issues: (1) whether the child-endangerment conviction categorically fits the immigration “crime of child abuse” ground—especially after Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ended Chevron deference; and (2) whether the agency committed reviewable legal error in denying cancellation, given its credibility and evidentiary findings.

2. Summary of the Opinion

Removability: The Second Circuit denied review. It held that it remains bound by prior circuit precedent treating New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) as categorically matching the BIA’s child-abuse definition, and that Loper Bright does not permit a panel to disregard those precedents. The court also noted an independent procedural barrier: Hinds did not raise his removability challenge to the BIA.

Cancellation of removal: The Second Circuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Hinds’s arguments attacked factfinding and the weighing of evidence—matters largely insulated from review by statute—rather than presenting a constitutional claim or colorable question of law.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) Child-abuse removability and post-Loper Bright stare decisis

Matthews v. Barr, 927 F.3d 606 (2d Cir. 2019): The court treated Matthews as controlling authority that a conviction under New York’s child-endangerment statute is a categorical match to the BIA’s definition of “child abuse.” Matthews also supplied the panel-rule framework: panels are bound by prior panels unless overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.

Florez v. Holder, 779 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2015): Florez is the earlier decision adopting the BIA’s child-abuse definition in the context of New York Penal Law § 260.10(1), at least in part within a Chevron-deference framework. Hinds relied on Florez’s observation that it was “unlikely” the court would have adopted the BIA’s definition absent deference.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024): The petitioner argued that because Loper Bright overruled Chevron, the circuit should stop deferring to the BIA’s definition and revisit Florez/Matthews. The panel rejected that move, emphasizing Loper Bright’s statement that it did “not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework.”

Garcia Pinach v. Bondi, 147 F.4th 117 (2d Cir. 2025): The opinion treated Garcia Pinach as the circuit’s post-Loper Bright instruction that “Loper Bright provides no basis for us to disregard” earlier Chevron-reliant circuit precedent. This case is the immediate bridge from Loper Bright’s general statement to the Second Circuit’s operational rule of adherence.

Ud Din v. Garland, 72 F.4th 411 (2d Cir. 2023): Cited for the issue-exhaustion principle—courts generally do not review issues not first presented to the agency. The panel used Ud Din to underscore that Hinds did not challenge removability before the BIA.

2) Cancellation-of-removal review limits and the law/fact line

Rodriguez v. Gonzales, 451 F.3d 60 (2d Cir. 2006): Used to frame the two-step structure of cancellation of removal: (i) statutory eligibility and (ii) discretionary decision whether relief is warranted.

Wilkinson v. Garland, 601 U.S. 209 (2024): Central to jurisdiction and standards. The court cited Wilkinson both for the proposition that review is limited to constitutional claims and questions of law, and for its taxonomy distinguishing reviewable “application of a statutory legal standard … to an established set of facts” from unreviewable factfinding like credibility determinations.

Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, 516 F.3d 35 (2d Cir. 2007): Cited for the idea that use of an “incorrect legal standard” can supply a reviewable question of law in cancellation cases.

Mendez v. Holder, 566 F.3d 316 (2d Cir. 2009): Cited for the principle that “ignoring or seriously mischaracteriz[ing]” important facts can present a reviewable legal error.

Penaranda Arevalo v. Bondi, 130 F.4th 325 (2d Cir. 2025): The court relied on Penaranda Arevalo to draw the jurisdictional line: it lacks jurisdiction to review “the agency’s weighing of the evidence, or the logic it employed in drawing inferences from it.”

3) Use of police reports/complaints and agency fact roles

Padmore v. Holder, 609 F.3d 62 (2d Cir. 2010): Invoked by Hinds to challenge reliance on a police report. The panel distinguished Padmore as a case about impermissible BIA fact-finding (not the IJ’s factfinding role).

In re Arreguin De Rodriguez, 21 I. & N. Dec. 38 (B.I.A. 1995): Cited by Hinds to argue arrest reports deserve little weight. The panel distinguished it: there, prosecution was declined and wrongdoing was denied; here, there was a conviction and not a complete denial.

Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just., 498 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 2007): The panel treated Carcamo as affirming that “police reports and complaints, even if containing hearsay and not a part of the formal record of conviction,” may be admitted for discretionary-relief determinations.

Argueta v. Holder, 617 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting In re C-V-T, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7 (B.I.A 1998)): Cited for the proposition that “proof of genuine rehabilitation” is a relevant discretionary factor in the overall balancing test.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) Removability: exhaustion + binding precedent after Loper Bright

The court’s removability analysis proceeds on two reinforcing tracks.

Agency exhaustion: Because Hinds did not challenge removability in his BIA appeal, the court invoked Ud Din v. Garland for the general rule against reviewing issues not presented to the agency. The panel noted this as a threshold obstacle, though it also addressed the merits in the alternative (“assuming arguendo”).

Stare decisis despite Chevron’s demise: On the merits, the panel treated Florez v. Holder and Matthews v. Barr as binding circuit precedent establishing that New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) qualifies under the BIA’s “crime of child abuse” definition. Although Hinds argued Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo undermined those decisions by eliminating Chevron deference, the panel applied the circuit’s post-Loper Bright approach from Garcia Pinach v. Bondi: Loper Bright expressly disclaimed disturbing prior Chevron-based outcomes, so it does not provide an “intervening Supreme Court decision” sufficient to permit a panel to overrule prior circuit authority.

In practical terms, the decision announces a stability rule: in this circuit, the end of Chevron does not automatically reopen settled circuit constructions in immigration cases where the circuit previously deferred to the agency, absent a more specific Supreme Court signal or en banc reconsideration.

2) Cancellation of removal: jurisdictional limits and deference to IJ factfinding

For cancellation, the panel emphasized the statutory jurisdictional bar in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), with the savings clause for constitutional and legal questions in § 1252(a)(2)(D). Citing Wilkinson v. Garland and Penaranda Arevalo v. Bondi, the panel treated credibility determinations, evidentiary weight, and inferential reasoning as unreviewable factual matters.

The panel then mapped Hinds’s arguments onto that law/fact line:

Credibility and the incident facts: The IJ found Hinds generally credible but not credible about the incident underlying the conviction, because his testimony conflicted with the victim’s sworn statement and other record evidence (including an order of protection). The court characterized this as classic IJ factfinding under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B), not legal error.

Police report reliance: The panel relied on Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just. to conclude that police materials can be used in discretionary-relief adjudication. It also rejected the claim that the BIA engaged in improper factfinding, pointing to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (BIA reviews IJ factfinding only for clear error). Padmore v. Holder was distinguished on this basis.

Rehabilitation evidence: The IJ considered Hinds’s failure to complete sex offender counseling (even if not court-ordered) as part of the discretionary assessment, supported by Argueta v. Holder and In re C-V-T. The panel treated Hinds’s objections as disagreement with weighing and inference, not a legal-standard error under Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales or a serious mischaracterization under Mendez v. Holder.

Because Hinds did not identify a legal-standard mistake, a constitutionally cognizable defect, or a serious record distortion, the court held it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed that portion of the petition.

C. Impact

Post-Loper Bright continuity in the Second Circuit: Even after Chevron’s overruling, litigants challenging long-settled circuit outcomes that incorporated Chevron deference face a steep barrier. This order—tracking Garcia Pinach v. Bondi—signals that only an en banc decision or a more directly on-point Supreme Court ruling is likely to dislodge existing circuit immigration precedent.

Strategic premium on agency issue preservation: The court’s reliance on Ud Din v. Garland reinforces that arguments (including new legal theories prompted by intervening Supreme Court decisions) should be raised to the BIA to avoid forfeiture/exhaustion problems.

Narrow channel for cancellation-of-removal appellate review: The decision exemplifies the constrained review permitted by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (D) after Wilkinson v. Garland: framing disputes as “legal questions” will fail if the substance is disagreement with credibility calls, evidentiary weight, or inferences.

Use of police statements in discretionary relief: By leaning on Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just., the order underscores that sworn victim statements and police documents can significantly influence discretionary relief outcomes even if they include hearsay—so long as used for discretionary assessment rather than categorical removability.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

“Categorical match”: A method of deciding whether a state conviction fits a federal immigration removal category by looking at the statute’s elements (what the law requires for conviction), not the person’s specific conduct. Here, prior cases held New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) matches the BIA’s “child abuse” concept.

Chevron deference and Loper Bright: Chevron required courts (in many circumstances) to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ended that doctrine going forward, but—crucially for this case—the Supreme Court said it was not reopening past cases that used Chevron. The Second Circuit treats that as a reason to keep following its earlier decisions unless an en banc court or the Supreme Court specifically changes the rule.

Issue exhaustion: Generally, you must present an argument to the agency (here, the BIA) before asking a federal court to review it. The court cited this as a reason it “generally” will not review removability arguments not raised before the BIA.

Discretionary relief vs. eligibility: Even if someone is legally eligible for cancellation of removal, the IJ can still deny it as a matter of discretion after weighing positive and negative factors (rehabilitation, seriousness of conduct, family ties, etc.).

Jurisdiction limits and “questions of law”: Congress largely barred courts from second-guessing discretionary denials like cancellation, except for constitutional claims and legal questions. Courts may review legal-standard mistakes, but not ordinary fact disputes like who is more credible or how much weight to give a police statement.

IJ vs. BIA fact roles: The IJ is the factfinder. The BIA generally may not find new facts; it reviews the IJ’s factfinding for “clear error.” That distinction is why Padmore v. Holder (BIA factfinding) did not help Hinds where the IJ made the factual determinations.

5. Conclusion

The Second Circuit’s disposition in Hinds v. Bondi reinforces two practical rules in immigration litigation. First, within the circuit, Loper Bright does not authorize panels to depart from prior Chevron-influenced circuit holdings such as Florez v. Holder and Matthews v. Barr; absent en banc or Supreme Court overruling, those decisions continue to govern. Second, challenges to the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal must identify a genuine legal or constitutional defect; disputes over credibility, evidentiary weight, and factual inferences—like the agency’s reliance on a victim’s sworn police statement—are typically outside the court’s jurisdiction.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:21.776558

She is an assistant professor and the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic here at Stanford Law School, where she represents employees, non-citizens, consumers, unions, criminal defendants, and civil rights plaintiffs before the United States Supreme Court.
’cause that seems to appear the most in the most number of Supreme Court opinions these days.
But the Supreme Court has been understandably nervous about second guessing when the President says something is an emergency because, uh, the Supreme Court doesn’t know anything about foreign affairs.
The, uh, Supreme Court, I’m gonna forget the name of this particular order ’cause there were a series of removal related Supreme Court orders, but in the, the Supreme Court made very, very clear in an unrelated case about removal from another agency that they thought the rule would be different for the Fed.","Hi everyone. Good evening. My name is Bella Ryb and I’m the executive director of the Constitutional Law Center here at Stanford. And it is my pleasure to welcome you all to our annual Supreme Court roundup and preview. Tonight we have three fabulous panelists to talk us through the most important Supreme Court cases of last term and this term, and I’m excited to introduce them.

First, we have our very own Easha Anand. She is an assistant professor and the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic here at Stanford Law School, where she represents employees, non-citizens, consumers, unions, criminal defendants, and civil rights plaintiffs before the United States Supreme Court. Recent victories in cases Easha has briefed and argued at the Supreme Court, include wind on behalf of a long distance truck driver tricked into buying a product that contained a federally controlled substance, a jeweler jailed after police fabricated evidence against him, and, in a unanimous opinion, a whistleblower fired after reporting violations of securities regulations.

Prior to joining the SLS faculty, Professor Anand was a Supreme Court and appellate counsel at the MacArthur Justice Center, where she litigated police, excessive force, prison condition, wrongful conviction, and other criminal defense and civil rights cases in state and federal courts of appeal around the country.

Easha received her JD from the University of California Berkeley School of Law, and clerked for former Judge Paul J. Watford on the Ninth Circuit and for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Jeremy Feigenbaum is the Solicitor General of New Jersey, a role he has held since July 2020. Jeremy is the state’s first Solicitor General, a role from which he helps coordinate the New Jersey Attorney General’s involvement in matters before the United States Supreme Court, federal Circuit Courts, and the New Jersey Supreme Court, and provides assistance to the department in cases involving significant constitutional and appellate issues.

Jeremy previously served as counsel in the office of the New Jersey Attorney General before joining the office of the Attorney General. Jeremy was an associate at Kirkland and Ellis in New York. He has also served as an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law. He clerked for Judge William Fletcher of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Justice Atlanta Kagan of the United States Supreme Court. He graduated from Brown University and Harvard Law School.

Last but not least. Colleen Sinzdak is a partner in the Washington DC office of Millibank LLP, and a member of the firm’s Litigation and Arbitration group. She specializes in Supreme Court appellate and complex litigation. She also provides strategic advice regarding constitutional issues and legal trends in the federal court, drawing on her many years of experience as an assistant to the list, the Solicitor General in the United States Department of Justice, Ms.Sinzdak has argued 11 cases before the Supreme Court, advocating for winning positions in major cases involving securities, litigation, bankruptcy, patent law, and more. She has also briefed well over 100 Supreme Court cases. She clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court. With that, I’ll hand it over to our panelists. Thank you.

Thank you Bella. Can you guys hear me in the back? Is this better? Better? Yeah. Okay. Uh, thank you Bella. Thanks to the Constitutional Law Center. Uh, thank you all for being here. It is such a treat to be here with Jeremy and Colleen. So thank you two from flying for flying out. Um, so those of you who have been here in previous years kind of know the drill.

We’ll each take a few minutes to kind of put a theme or a high level thought about the court on the table. Then we’ll kind of each run through a case from last term that’s significant and a case from this upcoming term that’s significant. Um, and one of us will kind of take point on table setting and explaining what the case is about.

Uh, but I hope that both of you will feel free to kind of chime in with questions and comments as we go along. Um, so with that, maybe Colleen, I’ll turn it over to you to start, if you don’t mind. Um, uh. Court at this moment an idea or thought you wanna kind of put on the table or an observation you wanna share?

I’m sorry. I’ll figure out the microphone before I talk again. Uh, can people hear me? Great. Okay.

Hello? Oh, can you hear me now? Okay, great. Um, uh, I was always too loud as a child, so wearing microphones makes me very self-conscious. Um, anyway, what I was, what I started out saying is that I, I think that the court, that, that there’s a lot to be praised about the court right now. I think this is an incredibly difficult time in our country and I think that the court is functioning and, um, I’m not, I’m not going to say well, but I actually, I think that in a lot of ways it is actually functioning quite well.

So at a time when Congress is not, uh, legislating and the, um, president is doing something, but maybe not exactly what the, um, constitution contemplates in all respects, uh, I think that the Supreme Court is functioning as, um, the Constitution contemplates. I think that it is, it is deciding cases and I think that it is, um, deciding cases and, and, and talking, uh, and, and demonstrating how people can, um, speak to one another with very different views in government in a way that the other branches perhaps are not.

So I think if you, uh, go to an oral argument, um, you would be surprised, uh, because if you read in the newspapers, the, um, court is depicted as this, uh, partisan beast. Um. If you read the Supreme Court decision, sometimes there’s quite a lot of, uh, rhetoric from, um, both sides. If you go to oral argument, you get a very, um, civilized, thoughtful argument about the law.

It’s not just a bunch of people saying what their policy preferences are. It’s not a bunch of people yelling at each other or, um, name calling. It’s actually people trying to have a serious discussion about, um, about the cases and about the principles. And it’s sort of, um, encouraging in this time to see, uh, one area of our government continuing to function.

So that’s what I wanna put on this, on the table. I recognize it’s not the most popular, but that I, I think we, we we can focus, uh, on what the Supreme Court is doing right. And just as a little end piece to say why I wanna focus on this is I think it’s really important to focus on what the Supreme Court is doing, right?

Because I think we’re in a time when the legitimacy of courts is being questioned and the need to adhere to judicial decrees is being questioned. And when we, uh, constantly focus on what’s wrong with the Supreme Court and wrong with courts, I think it actually makes it easier to, to push them aside and to say, why bother? Why bother with them? Anyway, so, um, focusing on the good. There you go.

Can I ask, I’m curious, the last kind of piece you put on the table about the kind of legitimacy of the court and the likelihood of following judicial decrees. What are your thoughts about kind of the Supreme Court’s role in that? Because I think, um, I maybe among others was a little bit surprised to see, for instance, the recent opinion by Justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh kind of chastising some of the lower courts. I think I’ve also been surprised to see that in general, um, the Supreme Court majorities have not taken to task behavior.

Um, that does call into question the legitimacy of the decrees, right? So in, you know, for instance, JGD, the kind of Judge Boasberg place case where he says, turn the planes around. Um, and there’s a bunch of, uh, conduct that the dissenters call out as shady. Justice Barrett joins everything but the part characterizing the shady conduct, for instance.

Um, uh, and so I’m curious if you think the court has a role either in buttressing the lower courts, or in calling out some of the behavior that comes close to skirting these sorts of judicial decrees, um, as part of its effort to kind of retain a legitimacy. I mean, I, I think, you know, what you, to, to, to focus on one specific issue.

I think Justice Barrett not joining that particular part was actually an attempt to stay out of what I think she may have perceived as a very, a political dispute. Um, I, I think something that has been tremendously. Useful to me is that, uh, many of my friends are of, of the conservative persuasion. Um, and I think that the way that the Judge Boasberg episode happened seemed very clearly one way.

And then I talked to some incredibly, I think, intelligent principled people who saw it in a different, in a different way. And I think there was some, like how you saw it, maybe did depend more on politics than I had at, at first appreciated. And so I, I think that some of the, like not doing that is trying not to engage.

And I think there are serious questions to be asked about, like, you know, at what point does not engaging is that, you know, abdicating your, your important role in protecting the judiciary and the, the judicial institution. But I, I think that that, that, that’s where that’s coming from.

Um, Jeremy, can I turn it over to you? Any theme, topic, opinion about the Court you wanna put on the table?

Yeah. Theme and topic. Um, first of all, thank you to all the same folks for having us. I know all three of us are excited to be doing this. I think the theme, okay, I might have to move. Oh yeah, I have to move that up. Like Colleen, I also was told I was too loud throughout my life and I am in fact too loud. So this is going to be an unusual experience, um, acoustic of this rule. Yeah, no, no, it’s great.

Um, two thoughts. First is like everything in American society right now, it’s impossible this year to talk about the Supreme Court without talking about the president. The president, President Trump is sort of like the defining figure for our government, for our institutions, for our courts right now. And like all the oxygen in all of our conversations about anything relating to governance, it’s impossible to have a conversation about SCOTUS and review this year without talking about the president and the policies that they’re specifically responding to coming out of the executive branch.

So what that means in a big way is that this was the year of the emergency docket. Some people call it the shadow docket. Some people call it the interim orders docket. I’ll use emergency docket. ’cause that seems to appear the most in the most number of Supreme Court opinions these days. Um, it is the year of the emergency docket, and I think it is the year that the emergency docket proved it’s here to stay. So we can have a big interesting debate about whether the emergency docket is a good idea or whether it’s a bad idea. I happen to fall in a really unhelpful perspective on the, it’s here to stay. It can’t be never. It can’t be always, and we have to figure out how to live with it and when to live with it and what role it’s going to play.

It can’t be never, because there are seismic decisions coming out of individual district courts that prevent a policy, uh, a president from adopting a landmark policy. It can’t be always because if the emergency docket has problems that I think everyone acknowledges, rushed decision making, a lack of oral argument, a lack of detailed briefing, when you don’t have the full consideration, you get from full merits briefing and for full oral argument, you can revert to the mean, you get decisions that don’t fully explain themselves in this posture.

And so I admit some sympathies to the members of the court who basically say, we recognize that this has costs, but it can’t be that we never do this because there are some decisions coming out from the lower courts, from both the district courts and the court of appeals that require our intervention.

And so if it’s here, if we have to live with it, if it’s here to stay, how do we improve its procedural regularity? And I think the court, and I think a lot of the sort of commentators are around the court n. It’s fine to talk about whether it’s good or bad, but it’s time to acknowledge it’s here and it’s time to acknowledge that we should try to figure out what are the best ways to improve it.

When should they have oral argument? What are the benefits of oral argument on these emergency cases? When should they just grant certiorari and turn the case in an expedited way into a merits case right out the gate? They’re trying different options across the board. So we will talk about individual cases later, but in the birthright case, they set argument in the Cook case, the, um, Lisa Cook fed, uh, fed board member case. They set argument in the slaughter case involving the firing and FTC official, they granted cert in most cases. They’re just issuing orders. When should they just issue orders? When should they turn these cases into full cases? How should they think about these cases knowing that we live in a new world with a pretty small merits docket and a pretty big emergency docket.

And that’s gonna define in many ways the success of the court and how people grapple with the court. And so it’s time to pivot ourselves into living with it. Um.

Maybe I’ll actually use my time to ask you a follow up question, which is about, um, my prediction that actually we’re gonna see more oral argument. So here’s my thesis and I’ll be curious to hear both your reactions. So, um, we know there’s sort of one fairly consistent vote actually for briefing an oral argument, which is Justice Kavanaugh, right? So he is, um, dating back to a case called Labrador v. Doe, which was about Idaho’s ban on gender affirming care. He writes his concurrence, that’s sort of like, you know, I think we should be setting argument a lot more. These, these sort of interim orders have a lock in effect, um, and there’s no reason we can’t do it. And then actually somewhat consistently in the Trump cases, right? So in a A RP, that’s the Third Alien Enemies Act case that sort of turn the buses around in Texas case, in boil the case about firing the kind of purportedly independent head of the consumer product safety commission, both cases, he writes these concurrences saying, I think we should set this for argument one vote.

I’ve kind of understood why to date a bunch of the other justices haven’t wanted to, to be the remaining votes. It’s four votes to grant cert. We got one, the three liberals. Maybe you thought at some point that you could limit the kind of bad law from your perspective that’s being made. Right. The state decisions, um, for a long time were considered not precedential. Right? It was not so long ago that Justices, Alito and Kavanaugh in a case called Merrill v. Milligan about, um, which was one of these redistricting cases where the Supreme Court granted a stay. Um, they would literally write a concurrence that says like, please no one mistake this for precedent. To reiterate, this opinion is not precedential, right?

And so maybe you’re one of the three liberals you think, I don’t wanna force a grant ’cause that’ll convert this from an emergency docket, uh, order that is not precedential. To read it, not precedential, um, to something that that’s got real force that’s in the US reports. Um, you know, we’ve heard skepticism from some of the other justices.

Justice Gorsuch in the TikTok case, which was one of these kind of expedited cases, writes, you know, because it was so expedited, I can’t profess the kind of certainty I would like to have. Justice Barrett, um, in a case that where the court granted cert early in the lifecycle of a case, um, about, um, Idaho’s abortion ban, when the court has to dismiss the case, she writes, you know, facts on the ground are changing, I think it was a bad idea to do this early. So if you’re the liberals, if you are Justice Gorsuch, who wants to have this kind of certainty, if you’re Justice Barrett, who’s worried about facts on the ground changing, I think I understand why to date you have not wanted to be votes 2, 3, 4 for a cert grant, full argument and briefing.

Um. That’s changed, right? So in recent months we’ve seen, uh, case after case where the court has treated prior emergency docket orders as squarely precedential. Um, so for instance, in the kind of removal cases, we saw kind of an initial case, um, about the firing of the, uh, MSPB and NLRB heads, uh, where the court doesn’t even really reach the merits, right?

It sort of says, uh, we think that the government’s likely to prevail on part of the analysis, but we don’t have any opinion about whether this falls into an exception. And yet the follow-on cases come up and they’re just citing back to that case. Um, there’s a series of cases about whether funding challenges go to district court or have to go to the court of federal claims.

Um, the Supreme Court not only cites back to emergency docket opinions and their reasoning, but in one instance, justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh even chastised the lower courts for not kind of squarely following that earlier precedent. So I guess my, my prediction is. Why hold back now? I think that we’re gonna see a lot more oral argument ’cause whatever your worries are about the difference between these emergency docket orders and what’s in the US reports, um, whether it’s because of bad law or certainty or whatever other values you have, it seems like that difference is getting erased.

So I’m curious if, if you think that’s right as a predictive matter or that pendulum’s gonna not gonna swing the other way.

I, I share Easha’s prediction that we’re likely to see more cases where they grant either cert immediately upon the emergency application or set additional briefing and argument.

I don’t know. I’m ready to say we’ll see it in sort of like the modal way that they handle these emergency applications. But I think we’re gonna see significantly more. We’re already seeing an increased number of this term. We’re already seeing. In two cases this year, they’ve already granted in these removal cases, one, they granted right from the emergency application for the removal of an FTC member. And then in the Lisa Cook case I was mentioning before, they set that for additional briefing and argument. So I think we’re gonna see the emergency docket as a way to tee up full briefing and oral argument a little more. I have to say, I think partially because of what Easha is identifying, I think in some respects it’s a welcome development.

If these orders are going to be precedential and if they’re going to bind the country for a couple of years before the US Supreme Court returns to the issue on the merits, then they’re effectively final. A great example is what we call the agency dismantling cases. I’m gonna try to avoid using like pejorative language. I’ve litigated some number of these cases, so I may have some strong feelings at various times. I’m sure there’s a better framing than agency dismantling cases. I think you can probably call them reduction in force cases instead. So call them RF cases, call them agency dismantling cases. Call them what you will. But the, the downsizing considerably of federal agencies. And those were consistently decided by emergency order without more detailed briefing, without more detailed oral argument, uh, and without detailed opinions. And that’s gonna last for a couple years. And it means that some agencies have lost 40% of all employees, 50% of all employees or more.

And so if that has happened and years go by, you can never refill those agencies. So if that’s gonna be effectively the final decision for the country on the validity of the rif slash downsizing slash dismantling of these agencies, it would be good. For the US Supreme Court to be confronted with the full panoply of arguments for the merits and demerits of that position and an oral argument to grapple more with the nuance.

Because one thing I found, and I think this goes to Colleen’s point earlier, oral argument does force courts to grapple more with nuance. It might not change the actual outcome of the bottom line vote, but it forces them to think about how far their rule goes. It forces them to talk to each other in open court about how far different sorts of rules go.

And when you add a little more procedural regularity, you might end up producing opinions that have a little more caveat, a little more, carve out a little more recognition of what makes that case particularly hard. And so it might not even change all the outcomes, but we’ll have more detail, more answers for why certain decisions were reached and may reached, and maybe a recognition on what the kind of cases are that would be different so that all of us as litigants, as states, as federal actors, as nonprofits as, as, uh, law school clinics will have more certainty about why decision X came out a certain way. So trial courts can know how best to follow it, and parties can know how best to litigate that precedent in the next case. So maybe speaking of a high profile case that migrated from the emergency docket to the merits docket, um,

Jeremy, uh, you argued the CASA case about universal injunctions. It was a masterful argument. If anyone has not listened to it yet, um, you offered to recap that case and tell us what you think it, it portends.

Okay. I am hopelessly biased about this case, so I will do everything in my power to check my biases about this case. Uh, the New York Times had a great title, uh, talking about this case that said the case about birthright citizenship in parentheses, but is really about nationwide injunctions.

And I thought that was like the perfect way to encapsulate it because so. Trump v. CASA is ostensibly a case, but is in no way a case about birthright citizenship itself, although it’s certainly looming in the background for this case. The first day of Trump two, President Trump issued an executive order redefining birthright citizenship, and a number of lawsuits were filed by states, by nonprofit organizations and by individuals and putative classes of individuals representing birthright citizens themselves.

And from my perspective, given, uh, 150 years of Supreme Court precedent and a very long, uh, tradition under the Fourteenth Amendment and predating the Fourteenth Amendment of what citizenship has always meant in this country, we all want our cases. And the United States, uh, perhaps recognizing the strength of our merits position did something very different in this case than it did in all the other cases.

In all, in basically every other case, not literally every other case, but close to every other case that it’s taken up to the US Supreme Court in the emergency docket in the last seven months, eight. Nine months, whatever, whatever amount of time it’s been. 10 years. Yeah. Dog months. Um, it, it, it took up the merits and all the other cases, but in this case, it conspicuously said Supreme Court, we are not here to talk to you about birthright citizenship. We are here to talk to you about a different problem. The fact that these individual trial courts across the country have all blocked the president across the nation from adopting his birthright citizenship executive order. And they made a case that this was a particularly good vehicle for the US Supreme Court to consider this question that had been bothering them for some number of years because it came from a presidential executive order.

I’m gonna explain later why that potentially made it a useful vehicle for them. Um, and the Supreme Court treated it very differently than the way it was treating the other applications. Set it for oral argument and invited additional amicus briefing. My one procedural comment here is that these were early days, and this is one of the reasons I’m so bullish on additional briefing in these cases too.

These were early days where it wasn’t yet fully known that, uh, a filing by the president and the US Solicitor General’s office to the US Supreme Court would almost certainly get emergency relief if they agreed with him on the particular argument he was making. And so a lot of that brief has discussions about why on this posture it’s too soon for the Supreme Court to come in.

It has a lot of stuff about the equities of why the public interest or irreparable harm does not support the, the US Supreme Court stepping in at this stage. Now, it’s quite clear when you’re filing these sorts of filings in response to a, an emergency application by the president, you should de-emphasize those points and you should be just emphasizing why ultimately you think that the president does not have the right case on the merits because they have shown that they think the equities in these cases very much warrant early stepping in and allowing the president to.

Um, federal law as the president understands it if they ultimately agree with him. And so, um, we probably briefed seven pages on the question of universal injunctions, which is not the amount of briefing you would want as a party for heading into a US Supreme Court dis, uh, case about the propriety of universal injunctions and incredibly difficult legal question.

I do not think the birthright citizenship merits question is the hardest question I’ve ever had to litigate as a lawyer. But the universal injunctions question is a genuinely difficult question that has long vexed administrations of both presidential parties. And so ultimately we had argument and in my view, because of the increased procedural regularity that we saw in the emergency docket, in that case, we got a much more nuanced opinion that came outta the US Supreme Court.

It did not issue a decision that matched what New Jersey and the other states were ultimately asking for squarely, which was to specifically affirm our nationwide injunction. Instead, the US Supreme Court for the first time, as a majority said that, um, the statutes that govern, uh, jurisdiction in the courts, the equity power of the courts does not actually let, uh, these sorts of orders be issued.

But it had a ton of carve outs, a ton of carve outs, and from my perspective, the import or lack thereof of a case like Trump v. CASA is gonna completely rise or fall with how those questions get answered in the future. So, Trump v. CASA, big headline day of is the universal injunction is over.

But actually there’s tons of questions they note in the opinion that say maybe there are other opportunities to get nationwide relief. So they say sometimes, maybe even the states in this case still have an opportunity to get nationwide relief if we show we need it to protect ourselves from harm.

People move across borders when they’re citizens or not citizens. It harms us in a lot of ways when we’re dealing with our own punitive citizens. Maybe this is a case that meets that. They also said in cases where you’re challenging agency actions as distinct from presidential actions, a separate law, the Administrative Procedures Act may or may not.

They reserve the question entirely allow for this kind of universal relief across the board. So maybe presidential eos are exempt from this, but there’s a whole different statute with a whole different potential legal tradition that applies when an agency is acting instead. And also they said, and it shouldn’t be too hard, maybe to get class actions against a lot of these federal policies and how one answers those three questions, how easy it is for states to sue and when they need these sorts of broad remedies for complete relief.

Whether and when the administrative procedures act separately allows for this sort of universal relief and how easy it is to get class actions against federal policies will either make Trump v. CASA an incredibly seismic, hugely important case about the role of the federal government vis-a-vis everyone else, or a case that seemed a lot bigger than it was until everyone pivoted in the kind of filings that they filed going forward.

And so from my perspective, Trump v. CASA was arguably the biggest case of the term last term, and also arguably not going to make a huge difference on the ground. And I think anyone who tells you they know the answer to that, to how the Court’s gonna answer those three questions in the future is a little bit unknowable.

And all I’ll say is, before CASA there were three nationwide injunctions against birthright citizenship. And after CASA, there were four nationwide injunctions against birthright citizenship. And the United States did not take the injunctions back up knowing I think that they’d gotten everything that they were gonna get out of that case.

And so from my perspective, I think it is a really interesting, meaningful case about how the Supreme Court sees the role of courts writ large and sees its role vis-a-vis the lower courts, if there’s gonna be a big conflict between the executive and the judiciary, the Supreme Court’s making clear it wants to be the one deciding what the judiciary’s posture is, vis-a-vis the executive as much as possible.

It’s why we have an emergency docket, and it’s been so active. It’s why CASA reflects a certain conception about the role of different courts authority and a specific statement that the Supreme Court’s opinions will always be followed by the executive, a concession that the United States truly made during oral argument.

So it’s very much a story about the Supreme Court, making sure it has the authority over the judiciary for these inter branch conflicts, but what that means on the ground for litigation going forward. I, to me, is a big open question.

Yeah, I guess. I guess that is my question from it. I have to say, I read the opinion and I thought. I don’t think this is actually different from prevailing law, uh, in the sense that it seemed to just be saying, you know, remedies should be limited to the parties. And sometimes because of the nature of the particular legal dispute to truly remedy the party’s injury, you’re going to have to give wide relief. And I thought that was the law. Um, so I guess like what, what was added by uh, CASA?

So I think CASA did something very important, I think, um, and important has no value judgment in it. But I think that this part was important, which is I think that before CASA District Courts were all over the place about what were the basis for nationwide relief. So some district courts and in our view, the district court, in the case I had been litigating, thought that nationwide relief, you look for relief for the parties and nationwide relief makes sense here because the parties needed it and Justice Barrett for the majority leaves open that that might have been right and remands the question and says, maybe actually in this case, we’re just not deciding one way or the other. Maybe in this case a nationwide injunction is fine. You did have a series of decisions across administrations and the district courts that were issuing these decisions would vary, but the idea was the same, which would say, for example, uniformity in immigration law is important and therefore a nationwide injunction must follow.

And I think that way of reasoning of saying, like, uniformity of this area of law or of this right is enough to justify the injunction. That’s the kind of stuff I think CASA‘s taking off the table. And so I think CASA itself cites different district court opinions that were in front of it. There were three different district courts that went in front of it and it is saying, one of you looked like you used a test that works.

We’re leaving if you applied it right, but it looks like you used a test like Colleen is describing. That’s fair. Two of you look to us and the dissent disagrees with the reading of the district courts, but what matters is what the majority thought. The majority says. Two of you, you actually just thought like a uniformity or right sort of analysis is good enough to justify nationwide relief and that we’re taking off the table.

Uh, Colleen, I’m gonna kick it to you next. I’m actually excited you’re gonna talk about this case. ’cause I think it’s a challenge to your collegiality theme, maybe a little bit. Uh, that’s the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor. Um, I’ll turn this on.

Uh, yes. Look, no one is collegial all the time. Um, we have to look on balance. Uh. Uh, yeah, I, I, I find Mahmoud v. Taylor a really a tricky case. So just to give you the facts briefly, in case, um, you are not aware of it, this is the case in which the Supreme Court appended the pages of children’s books to its, uh, decision. Um, the actual question presented was whether Montgomery County Public Schools, which is actually the public school system that my children attend.

Um, yep. I’m a graduate of Montgomery County.

Oh, really? Well, we’ll talk later about where, but, um, anyway, uh, it’s about whether Montgomery County Public Schools was permitted to have a program in which they, um, they, uh, included books. And it’s so hard to talk about the facts of this case because the Def Defense dissent and the majority actually disagree strongly on the facts.

So I’m trying to kind of present a, a, a neutral, a neutral, uh, dis, uh, account, but books featuring LGBTQ+ characters arguably, um, encouraging the view that, um, that an LGBTQ lifestyle is okay, exists, um, a great thing and everybody should have to be it. Uh, it really, it kind of depends, um, on how you see these, uh, these particular children’s books.

Um, but Montgomery County introduces them into the curriculum. It originally offers an opt-out, and this is very important. It originally says, parents, if you do not want your children to participate when these books are being taught, you can let us know. And that opt-out was consistent with an opt-out that Montgomery County has for, I didn’t actually know this, but human sexuality classes.

Um, you can opt out, uh, you can say you don’t want your kids to, to, to, to be there for that instruction as well. Then Montgomery County, um, decided that that was not administrable, that the opt-out wasn’t working because too many people were asking for opt-outs. And unlike in the, um, in the human sexuality, uh, lessons, which were a discreet part of the curriculum, where you could say like, you know, next week we’re doing this, do you want your kids to sit out?

They were just using the, the whole point of this program was to just integrate the books into the curriculum throughout. So Montgomery County does away with the opt-out, a number of parents who do not want their children to be exposed to these books object. Uh, and they say that the teachings in the book, uh, that the books are being used to teach values that are contrary to their religion because they are teaching values that celebrate the LGBTQ+ lifestyle that celebrate the idea that, um, humans can have different, uh, can, can, can have different genders from the gender with which they’re born. Did I just use gender wrong? Okay, good. Um, alright, so, uh, um, so they, uh, object these v the this and they say that it is a burden, a First Amendment burden on their rights to, um, force their children to be, uh, getting public education, uh, with it without an opt out.

So the case comes to the Supreme Court, and interestingly, I really do think this is as I was an English major and a high school English teacher. And this is one of the few cases that seems to turn, to turn heavily on, um, on, on the interpretation, the, uh, of, of children’s books because Justice Alito writes this majority opinion saying that, yes, of course this is a First Amendment burden, an intolerable First Amendment burden, because he reads these children’s books as, um, ipar as as, as requiring, uh, as a message of like, uh, celebrating the LGBTQ plus lifestyle, celebrating, uh, the idea that you can have different genders over the course of your lifetime. And that, and, and he reads the instructive material accompanying these texts as, as, as, as essentially requiring teachers to say that these are values that our community has. Um.

Justice Sotomayor in dissent has a completely different reading of these children’s books. So her understanding of the children’s books is that these are books that simply treat LGBTQ+ people as existing, that they are just having char, they’re just characters. So, you know, there’s a, the, I, I’m gonna try to be brief on this, but the maj, the story that’s kind of at the, at the centerpiece is about a little girl who’s upset because her uncle is getting married. And Justice Alito reads this story as a sort of coy reference to the little girl being upset that her uncle is getting married because she’s upset that he is a gay man, marrying another man. And the lesson is she shouldn’t be upset. She should learn to celebrate it. And at the end, she does in fact celebrate the wedding. And Justice Alito reads this story as a story of a, a child learning, you should celebrate gay marriage.

I have to tell you, as a former English teacher, I actually think it’s just a story about a little girl who’s upset ’cause her beloved uncle is now maybe gonna spend more time with his husband and not with her. And I think the story, I think it would’ve been exactly the same if it was, uh, a, um, woman that he was marrying. Um, that so, so that story, I think Justice Sotomayor has the better of the, uh, literary interpretation.

There are other stories where I actually think that Justice Alito has the better of the literary interpretation, where I think it is hard to read the stories as, as saying anything other than like, these are values that we should have. Um, you know, books are great because you can have lots and lots of different interpretations of them.

Um, but it’s really tough when you have a Supreme Court case that turns on this because, um, I don’t quite know what the holding of Mahmoud really is at the end of the day because I think. There’s one way of reading Justice Alito’s opinion to just say like, look, you can’t have a bunch of lessons in school where you tell everyone that they have to be happy about gay marriage.

Like, right. Like that’s one way of understanding it. And, and I think at the end of the day, we could probably all say like, okay, that’s, that’s pretty, pretty reasonable. Just like, you know, you can’t have a bunch of lessons at school saying that everybody has to believe that Jesus Christ was our Lord and Savior.

You know, like, fine, fine, that’s what’s going on. But if you read it actually as him saying, you know, people have to be able to opt out of being exposed to books that have, uh, LGBTQ+ people in it, that’s a much bigger statement. And that would be a decision that has much, much bigger effects. You know, again, as a former English teacher, I taught lots of books.

I was teaching in high school. I taught lots of books that had a lot of, um, characters of all different sorts in them that I’m sure you could have lots of objections to the messages of those books and the, and what was going on. And like, you know, the point is they, they, they just kind of existed and we were using them and we were talking about them and we were having open discussions and I’m genuinely not sure reading Mahmoud whether I would have to allow opt-outs for a lot of the books that I was teaching, what my responsibilities would be.

And, and that’s, that’s really tough. So I find Mahmoud an interesting and really tough case. I actually looked online to see the California Public Schools has put out, um, public school system has put out guidance on Mahmoud that kind of says what I said I just said, which is like, we don’t really know what it means. Don’t do anything dramatic because no one’s quite sure exactly what that decision is going to stand for in the end.

Uh, well, I, I have a lot of thoughts about the case as a Montgomery County Public School graduate, as the owner of both Uncle Bobby’s Wedding and Pride Parade. I’ve read them both to my kid.

Yeah. Um, uh, but in the interest of kind of getting through a few more cases before we turn over to Q&A, um, and we, I’ll bring up the rear and talk a little bit about another blockbuster case from last term, uh, United States v. Skrmetti. So I’ll be brief about the background of this case, ’cause I think it’s one that’s familiar to a lot of people.

Um, about half the states have passed partial or total bans on gender affirming care for minors. This is treatment that’s lifesaving for a lot of children and their families. Um, and so both United States, this is during the Biden administration and the individual families represented by the ACLU sue to enjoin one of these bans in Tennessee.

Um, uh, Sixth Circuit upholds it so they lose the Sixth Circuit. They seek certiorari. Quick note at the outset. So both the United States and the ACLU seek certiorari, um, and the United States petition contains one question. It asks just does this law violate the equal protection clause? The ACLU petition has two different questions.

It’s the equal protection clause piece, and then it’s also a question about the substantive due process rights of the parents. Um, I think sort of, uh, puzzlingly to a lot of observers, the Supreme Court just takes the United States petition and not the ACLU petition puzzlingly because, um, at that point it was clear that there was some chance that the administration was going to change, right?

The United States position on this issue was going to change. We were in an election year, and, uh, lo and behold, come January, um, uh, the Trump administration comes in and says, we think actually Tennessee’s law is totally constitutional. Puzzling also because, you know, the Supreme Court has been raring, or at least some of the justices have been raring, um, to deal with this kind of substantive due process parents’ rights question. So we see, um, justices, uh, Alito and Thomas in a couple of different cases, writing these dissents from denial of certiorari. So cases where the Supreme Court says, we’re not taking this case, these two justices say, would like to take this case, um, about that issue. They, the cases that they’re interested in arise from, um, school districts that have a policy that says, um, uh, if a child doesn’t want you to, you don’t tell their parents what pronouns they’re using at school.

And, uh, this has been challenged on the kind of substantive due, substantive due process, parents’ rights front. So that’s at the outset of the case. Okay. So what are the arguments that get made within this equal Protection Clause framework? Um, so remember, right, 1L Con Law, um, uh, most laws just get what’s called rational basis review, right? So laws just dripping with animus or wholly arbitrary. We trust the democratic process. Certain laws that classify on so-called suspect characteristics, things like race, sex, national origin, get what’s called heightened scrutiny. So you have to look a little bit more into whether there’s an actual problem being solved and that this law is kind of a good way to do it, because otherwise you’re worried about kind of rank discrimination.

So challengers make two sets of arguments, right? They say first this bill classifies on the basis of sex. If you were assigned male at birth and you want to take, um, uh, uh, puberty blockers or hormone therapy to deepen your voice or get facial hair, totally okay? If you are assigned female at birth and you wanna take the same drugs, uh, to deepen your voice or to develop facial hair, not okay. Under Tennessee’s law, that’s a sex classification.

Second, they say this bill also classifies, uh, people on the basis of their transgender status, right? Um. And, uh, even though the Supreme Court has not ruled on this yet, that is a suspect characteristic akin to, um, uh, uh, sex or race or these other, uh, characteristics that trigger heightened scrutiny.

So after argument, um, was clear the challenges were gonna lose, and the question was, how are they gonna lose? So possible path number one, which would’ve been kinda the best case scenario for the challengers, would have been the court holding or accepting for the sake of argument that this law did classify in the basis of sex or transgender status, um, and doing the kind of heightened scrutiny analysis, right? And the court could have said, um, again, in this world where the challengers are losing, look, this is about minors. It’s about medical care. It’s about from what our perspective is still evolving science, uh, and therefore this law is okay, even under heightened scrutiny. And that would’ve been the best possible outcome, I think, for the challengers, because it would’ve been devastating for a lot of families on the ground today. It would make clear that these sorts of laws are subject to some sort of scrutiny, and it would leave open the possibility that if the medical consensus changed these sorts of laws could be revisited.

The Court didn’t take that off ramp. I think it took the second least bad option from the challenger’s perspective, um, which was to basically say, um, uh, look, this law does not classify in either of those bases. We don’t have to address whether transgender status gets this kind of heightened protection. Um, instead we’re gonna say, this law classifies on the basis of medical condition.

Right? So they say neither a boy nor a girl can get, uh, puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria. Transgender boy cannot get puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, but can get puberty blockers to treat premature puberty. Um, uh, I’d sort of commend folks to the def descent written by my former boss, justice Meyer, which I think takes apart this logic, um, uh, pretty effectively.

Um, the path is in terms of practical consequences, I think still far worse than the first outcome, right? It puts, um, state could pass a law outlawing this kind of treatment for adults and, uh, uh, that would classify in the basis of medical condition. And so it be subject only to rational basis review. Um, but it would, it’s not as bad for the challengers as the path the three of the Justices, justices, Barrett, Alito, and Thomas.

So Barrett, again, people always talk about kind of the 3, 3, 3 court and sort of put her squarely in the middle. Um, on this issue at least, she’s certainly not in the center of the court. It’s the Chief Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh that take this kind of middle path. Um. The path that Justice Barrett articulates says I would address right now the question of whether transgender status is suspect, um, and I would say no. So I would say laws that classify on the basis of transgender status don’t trigger any form of heightened scrutiny. Um, now the majority reserves that question, so who knows where it ends up? Um, uh, but at least for now, I would, I would assess this as the court picked. The second, the second least, the, the, the middle path among the worst in the world where the challenges are losing. The court picked the middle path, um, uh, despite three justices urging them to go further.

Um, with that, I, I guess I’m hoping we can transition to talking about the term coming up, um, blockbuster case in the docket, uh, tariff’s case that Colleen is helping to spearhead litigation about. Um, so we’re very lucky to have you here talking about the case. Tell us what’s going on and what your predictions are, without compromising any client con confidences.

Yes. So I am working on the litigation, so I’m only talking about publicly available information. Um, I am on the team of, uh, people representing a number of small businesses who sued to challenge, uh, President Trump’s Liberation Day, uh, tariffs.

Those were the tariffs that were imposed worldwide, um, on a number of countries, uh, in percentages between 10% and 50% increases. On, on, actually, I think just on, yes, on tariffs, uh, that on the existing tariffs. Um, President Trump introduced these tariffs in, in saying like, this is a, we are overhauling, uh, the tariff system and the American economy. This is going to be a massive change. Um, and the executive orders that he used to impose these new tariffs explained that there have been persistent large trade deficits, which were harming American manufacturing, um, harming Americans, um, national security readiness, uh, in terms of, of our dependence on foreign, uh, military supplies and, um, that, and, and, and overall just creating an emergency and an extraordinary and unusual threat.

Now, he had to say that this was an emergency and extraordinary and unusual threat because he is imposing these tariffs under IEEPA, which is an emergency law, uh, that is for, that allows the president to use a range of economic sanctions, um, in situations that are both a declared emergency and an extraordinary and unusual threat.

So IEEPA has been used in the past, for example, to impose embargoes. Um, the most famous instance of its use was in the Iran, Iran hostage crisis in the seventies when, um, the United States or the President set up a, uh, actually a whole claim claims tribunal system under IEEPA for dealing with, um, for dealing with, uh, Iranian assets, um, in, as part of an effort to get the Iranian hostage, the, sorry to get the hostages back. Um, so IEEPA is an emergency statute. One of the emergency powers that it gives the president is the authority to regulate importation and exportation. President Trump and the government interpret that phrase, that, that phrase to mean, uh, tariffs.

The idea, the, their argument goes regulate importation. What does that mean? Well, one of the most obvious ways to regulate importation is to impose tariffs. And, um, yes, the statute does not in any other way refer to tariffs. There are no limits, for example, on, uh, the tariff authority. There’s no minimums, there’s no none of that.

But, um, the idea is there’s lots of other major powers being given under IEEPA, including, and this is undisputed, the authority to impose embargoes on trade altogether. And so the, the theory goes regulate importation is a broad power for use in these emergency situations. The challengers allege a number of things, a number of problems with this.

One of the problems is that regulate is a word that is actually used over, uh, a thousand times in the US code, and it is not used to refer to taxation. So you all remember from back in the day, by back in the day here, I mean the American Revolution. Um, we fought, uh, a whole war about taxation and therefore, um, the framers treated taxation differently from regulation.

So the very first clause that imposes that, that grants powers to Congress, grants Congress, the power to tax and the power to impose duties, which are like tariffs, right? So, um, separately you have to go down three more clauses before you get to the power to regulate. Okay? So separate, separate regulation is separate from taxing.

It’s separate from tariffs. So a statute that says regulate importation and the views of the challengers does, uh, including me, does not mean, um, does not give the, the authority to impose, uh, tariffs. Uh, there’s a number oth of other arguments if you, even if you don’t buy that one, is that this is not an emergency or an extraordinary and unusual threat.

I think that actually on a kind of common sense level, a lot of people have that intuition. While like the president needs broad powers and emergencies, maybe he needs the, the power to impose tariffs. But, you know, if he’s saying there’s a large and persistent trade deficit, maybe that’s not really an emergency.

But the Supreme Court has been understandably nervous about second guessing when the President says something is an emergency because, uh, the Supreme Court doesn’t know anything about foreign affairs. They’re wisely in this one area, aware of their own, um, their own fallibility. Uh, they’re also really afraid about telling, um, district courts that they can, uh, second guess the president’s emergency authorities, because, you know, in a legitimate emergency, if the president needs to do something, what you would not want is some, is a district court immediately stepping in and, and, and barring it.

And again, you have to, to imagine a, a, a genuine emergency. So that’s probably the most common sense argument, but probably has practical problems. We also point to a range of other specific tariff statutes that control here. And, um, if you’re law students, you’ve probably learned many times about the specific controls, the general canon.

So even if you think that IEEPA gives some general tariff authority, the more specific statutes, um, that that control in these particular circumstances and have actual limits on the tariff power, those should control. Plus, if you just look at those tariff statutes and they’re all specific, and if you look at any tariff statute in the, in the statute books, you’re gonna see specific limits put on it.

It starts to suggest that maybe IEEPA, this general statute that doesn’t refer to tariffs and doesn’t in fact put any limits on, isn’t really be, shouldn’t really be used for tariffs. And then finally, the nondelegation doctrine. That great doctrine that the, was probably, is probably dead, but who knows, um, which says that you, the, the, that Congress cannot give away all of its legislative authority.

The argument is if you interpret IEEPA to give away this tariff power, um, without any limits, then you’re basically giving the president the power to impose tariffs and taxes, which is Congress’s authority alone. So that would be a non delegation problem, the government’s main response, other than to say, come on, regulate importation.

That sounds like tariffs is to say this is foreign affairs. In the foreign affairs context, we have always interpreted the statutes broadly. We’ve always thought that the president should enjoy broad powers and you, this shouldn’t be any different. I expect to kind of hear, uh, a lot of sounding on the, you know, implicit sort of, this is Trump derangement syndrome.

Don’t look at, don’t, don’t kind of make a decision that’s going to impose limits. On, uh, the president, the, the, the powers the president needs in real emergencies based on your view that this president is abusing it in this particular circumstance. But I am hoping that, you know, we can, um, carry the day with plain text.

And then I should also mention major questions, doctrine, the idea that like no president has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs before. And, um, the court has been very fond of late of saying that Congress doesn’t hide, uh, elephants in mousehole. And, um, this really looks like, um, an elephant in a mouse hole if you find the power to over to rewrite the entire current economy, um, in this statute that’s supposed to be for foreign affairs emergencies.

I mean, one question I have for you, Colleen, on this because, uh, it’s what you brought up right at the end there where I was wondering if major questions was gonna come up in the discussion. I mean, one interesting thing going on at the court right now is what is the major questions, doctrine, when do you apply it?

And Justice Kavanaugh has, I think, the most interesting recent concurrence. On when he thinks the major questions doctrine should apply and when it should not, and when he thinks Congress would naturally think it is giving the executive untrammeled power and when you would think that they wouldn’t think they’re giving the executive that sort of sweeping power and trying to key the major questions doctrine to substantive areas of law.

And it seems like in his archetype, taxing would be the kind of thing that would be a major question because that’s not the sort of thing you would think that the executive can do in a plenary sense without Congress, but foreign policy and interrelationships with other nations is Brett Kavanaugh’s, number one thing that he thinks the executive is being given broad grants of authority to do so.

I’m curious how you think, you mentioned major questions, but I’m curious how you think tariffs will or will not teach us things about how to think about the major questions doctrine going forward. Yeah, I mean I do think that not Justice Gorsuch, who, I think Justice Gorsuch has a view of the major questions doctrine as a functionally nondelegation doctrine.

So it’s kind of, it would be unconstitutional for, um, Congress to grant large amounts of power. So if we think that like a statute is granting these large amounts of power, it’s as a constitutional matter. It just can’t, so we won’t, you know, the statute is unconstitutional to the extent it does that. I think that the, the, the kind of Justice, Justice Barrett, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice, and the Chief all think of major questions as a statutory interpretation, canon as, as, as exactly as you’re describing it.

Kind of like where would it make sense to think that Congress delegated tons of power? And in that sense, you know, I, I, I think that that’s the role it, it has to play here. And it does depend whether they are thinking of this as a taxing case or a foreign affairs case, and whether they really buy into the idea that, um.

Even when we’re talking about taxes, if you’re talking about taxes on imports, whether that actually, like, it doesn’t even matter that it’s taxing because, because foreign affairs taxes still implicate that broader power. So Curtiss-Wright, which, um, I recently heard someone describe as Curtiss-the government is always right– in, uh, foreign affairs context. Curtiss actually refers to tariffs in part of, uh, as part of that. And so, you know, I think it depends, to me it’s very obvious that, that because the first clause is giving Congress that power and is expressly referring to tariffs, not just taxes, not just, you know, domestic, the domestic realm. It has to be that Congress wouldn’t just give away those, that power.

But, you know, the Supreme Court has disagreed with me before.

Um, uh, well, thank you. Uh, we will all be tracking that case.

Uh, Jeremy, do you wanna take a minute and talk about the, the, I guess the, the couple of cases about presidential removals? And I’ll flag for folks that we’re gonna cut off wherever we are at 6:10. I have been told we are cutting things off so we have time for questions.So start to think about what you wanna ask because we’re gonna, uh, have at least 20 minutes of questions.

Yes, we are most interested in your questions and it will make for fun back and forth. We’ll be really off the cuff. Uh, two thoughts.

So one, as you’ve already discovered, I am your friendly neighborhood emergency docket man, and so I’m back to the emergency docket and back to the new ways to think about the emergency docket.

Thankfully, for the first time since I’ve spoken, I’m not talking about a case that I have litigated in any way. So I think, I think biases are less likely to creep in here. So, uh, there are two thus far, major removal cases at the US Supreme Court for this term. There is the question in Trump v. Slaughter about whether the president can remove members of the Federal Trade Commission, and that squarely presents an issue that the US Supreme Court has been thinking about taking about for a very long time. Maybe not since the American Revolution, but you know, back in a more recent day, it has been thinking about whether and when to overrule the seminal decision Humphrey’s Executor that allows for removal protections for members of multi-member boards in the executive branch.

And, uh, I I, I’m probably not gonna like fully predict everything that happens in all of these cases, but there are, you know, if we think of like four major, uh, Trump cases so far at SCOTUS are about to be at scotus, I think tariffs is hard to predict. We’ll talk about Lisa Cook, which is hard to predict. I do not think the other two are that hard to predict.

Um, I think the Trump administration is very clearly going to lose birthright citizenship on the merits and very clearly going to win Trump v. Slaughter. And I don’t think I get any points for those predictions ’cause I think basically everyone agrees. So on Trump v. Slaughter, I think it shows two interesting things.

One, this US Supreme Court has been very willing to overrule precedents that it thinks are sufficiently wrong, and that the main check on whether and when it will overrule precedents is whether it grants cert in the first place. Because once it grants cert, most of the other stare decisis factors have become overcome by the sense that the decision was truly wrong enough.

And so I think there are a number of precedents likely to be safe for some extended period of time because the court is unlikely to wanna return to the question and just isn’t gonna grant cert. But once the court grants cert on a question of whether to overrule it and you can feel confident that they strongly wouldn’t have decided it the first way, I don’t think the other starry decisis factors in any way hold them back from making that decision.

And so once they granted Trump v. Slaughter, and they granted certiorari before judgment. I think the writing is very clearly on the wall for how that one’s gonna come out. I will also say from a procedural perspective, it makes total sense that it was a, uh, before judgment in the way that they granted here, because there’s binding us Supreme Court precedent, no one else is able to hold that Humphrey’s Executor is no longer good law. So if someone’s going to hold Humphrey’s Executor is no longer good law. It has to be the US Supreme Court. They have to take it, they have to confront the question. Again. We can have a, you can have years of discussion about the merits and, and the costs of stare decisis.

I’m not gonna run through all of it here, but I think it is very clear that they’ve taken this for one reason and one reason only. I think the Cook case is very different. I think the Cook case is very interesting, very challenging and shows the way advocacy is shifting on the emergency docket, even in just the months since January and February of this year.

So the Cook case is interesting because this is about removals for the Fed and. The, uh, Supreme Court, I’m gonna forget the name of this particular order ’cause there were a series of removal related Supreme Court orders, but in the, the Supreme Court made very, very clear in an unrelated case about removal from another agency that they thought the rule would be different for the Fed.

They just said it, no one was debating it. And that particular case, and that’s how you know, the Supreme Court really cares about this. And the, the dissent makes fun of it and sort of calls it a bespoke exception for the Fed. But I strongly doubt the dissent. Once, uh, Slaughter comes out the other way, I strongly doubt the dissent will resist going along with the bespoke exception for the Fed.

Um, it’s, it’s a device for pointing out the problems with the decision in slaughter rather than, uh, a desire for the liberals to allow for removals from the, uh, Fed Governors. And it’s interesting because Advocacy’s really shifted as that case has gone on to Easha’s earlier point about, uh, shifts in cases on the ground, the Trump administration as in birth.

Has decided not to like, stake the end-all, be-all fight on whether there’s like plenary removal, vis-a-vis the Fed. Instead, the United States says we are accepting for these purposes. We can only remove Fed Governors for cause, but we think we have for cause here. And also we basically think you have to be completely deferential when we think there’s cause which gets you kind of to the same place, which is if you could ever review the president finding their cause, it’s not exactly what you would normally think of in the corporate setting as for cause removal obviously.

Um, but they say we’ll accept that it’s for cause removal. Then the challengers respond and the DC circuit and a concurring opinion by Judge Garcia accepts that. Okay, well if you’re accepting that, then we have a narrower thought too. Yes, we have an argument that you can review for cause even when the president finds it.

And that, um, to Colleen’s point about tariffs earlier, you should review the president’s fact finding, which is something the court has been openly quite nervous about. For many years. So yes, you can do that, but also you don’t have to, you can just say, well, if you need fact finding, then you need process.

Because if the president’s gonna find facts, you need to give process to the person that’s being fired to explain why he’s about to make the wrong factual call. And so everyone in interesting ways recognizes there’s a really sensitive area for the court. It’s clear both parties are not sure how it’s ultimately gonna come out.

And so the United States is making its narrowing pivot and the challengers are responding with their narrowing pivot. And it shows the way the emergency docket, everyone realizes you’re gonna get some seismic holdings. You’d better if you’re gonna try to win out in an area, you know, the court’s uncomfortable with, give them the path they think they can do the least damage in an area they’re nervous about.

And that’s, I think, what Cook is showing us in real time. Uh, so interesting. I agree. That’s a, uh, I’m very, very curious to see how that argument goes. Um. I thought I’d just take the five minutes at the end to review one of the huge cases on the docket that is not a “versus Trump” case. Um, but that is gonna have pretty seismic implications for kind of the way politics is done in America.

Um, so Louisiana v. Callais starts as a pretty traditional kind of section two of a Voting Rights Act case. So section two, uh, prohibits election practices that result in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race. Um, layered atop that over the past few generations, courts have kind of constructed a series of tests to figure out when this is happening, specifically in the redistricting context, cases to come to court. The challengers typically say some version of, uh, when you were drawing your sort of congressional district, let’s say. Um, you either tried to pack a bunch of, uh, voters of a particular race into one district, so they couldn’t have influence over more than one congressional representative.

Or you tried to what’s called crack the voters. That is you try to spread them out across so many districts that they don’t have sufficient electoral influence anywhere to elect the representatives of their choice. Um, and the court has said that the way you make out these claims is you first do what’s called the jingles factors, which is basically figure out, uh, whether there’s kind of racially polarized block voting.

Then you look at what are called the senate report factors, which is sort of a totality of the circumstances inquiry, where you look at kind of a history of discrimination, um, uh, uh, through to kind of the use of racial appeals and current politics. Um, so there’s this whole kind of apparatus that’s grown up around this, this kind of super statute.

Uh, so Louisiana loses one of these section two cases and so it has to redraw its map when it redraws the map. Non-black voters, that’s sort of the term that they use for themselves, come into court and say the redraw map, right? The one that was drawn to comply with section two of the Voting Rights Act over indexes on race and therefore violates the equal protection clause and comes to the court, court hears argument, and then somewhat ominously over the summer.

They ask for reargument ominously because the court basically does this in two situations. Situation one is where there’s a four four court. So, um, you know, after Justice Scalia passed, there was an interim before Justice Gorsuch got on the court. They ordered some rearguments when Justice Gorsuch got on the court, uh uh, because they were tied four-four, and he’d be the swing vote.

Sometimes it doesn’t for that reason. The other reason it does it is because it, uh, has a theory, uh, often a, a theory that no one is raising in the litigation that it really, really, uh, thinks is the right one. Uh, so Citizens United famous example of reargument, right? Um, so, uh, question is re argued on basically whether the Voting Rights Act, uh, violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

Um, dominant theme and argument. Um, I think it’s dominant. It could just be the Justice Kavanaugh asked this question like seven different times, so it seemed very dominant. But I think the dominant theme and argument was, um, basically the question of expiration date. So Court sort of says, uh, uh, you know, in cases like Shelby County about a different provision of the Voting Rights Act, uh, kind of says, you know, this is relying on stereotypes about what the South was like many generations ago, so it’s unconstitutional.

In Students for Fair Admissions, which was a case that struck down the affirmative action programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Um, uh, oral argument is dominated by this talk of, you know, 23 years ago there was an opinion that said that in 25 years, we hope the race, the use of race conscious admissions will end.

Um, so Justice Kavanaugh kinda asks over and over again, both the NAACP Legal Defense fund lawyer and the various folks saying that this is unconstitutional. Like what’s the end date? Um, and you know, the NAACP lawyer basically says three things. She says, um, first look, section two, this whole analysis. Um, it relies on facts on the ground today.

So. It will sunset when racially polarized block voting sunsets, right? The first thing you have to show is this prima facie case. People are segregated on the basis of race, on our, uh, uh, that minority voters are unable to elect the candidate of their choice. So when that stops happening, this will sunset automatically.

Second thing she says is, look, when you prove the violation of section two of the Voting Rights Act, all you’ve said is that this map is no good. Section two doesn’t tell us anything about what kind of map the state has to draw in response to that. Um, and so, you know, a state can redraw a map without taking race into account just so long as it doesn’t engage in these forbidden practices to try to dilute the votes of minority voters.

Um, uh, and the third thing she says is, look, Students for Fair Admissions is quite different because they’re the compelling government interest, right? The reason you were allowed to be race conscious in the admissions process was this idea of diversity in the class. Here, the basis on which we’re allowing race consciousness in some instances has to do with remedying specific racial discrimination.

And even in Students for Fair Admissions, the Supreme Court told us that that’s okay, that’s an okay use of race. Um, so we shall see what happens. I think that the, the stakes of this are quite big. So whether or not you think that section two of the Voting Rights Act is a good idea, whatever you think of the court’s current redistricting jurisprudence, um, the way that, you know, our House of Representatives is comprised turns to some extent on this case.

Uh, so an argument, the NAACP pointed out that every uh, uh, black elected representative, including the justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court in the state of Louisiana comes from a district that was drawn specifically to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Right. Some analysts say that we’re talking about 19 seats that would shift from Democratic to Republican control.

If, uh, voting Rights Act compliance wasn’t mandated in the same way, um, and, you know, in a lot of years that’s control of the house. So, uh, even though this is not a case about the president, I think it’s one we should all kind of be watching because it will have big implications for our politics and for the upcoming elections, whatever the outcome with that ballot day would do.

Okay. On time. Okay. With that, we’ll turn it over to the audience to, for questions, please line up at these two microphones and then we can go one by one.

Come on down.

Thank you so much for being here today. Very interesting. The question I have relates to the tariffs, uh, case and in particular, the justification of the administration is partly based on emergency and partially. Based upon the traditional deference, I guess, of the courts to the presidency as, for example, in Curtiss-Wright.

But as an emergency, it’s something that’s kind of dragged out and the whole process is taking a long time. And part of this is also based upon negotiations with other countries. And of course the treaty power is one that’s given to the president as well, but subject to the ratification of Congress. So my question is, in this context, if the Supreme Court seems to be inclined to disapprove, either in part or in large measure what the administration has done, what do you assess the probability that they might stay the action of the Supreme Court, uh, stay the action of the court for a period of time to permit Congress to ratify the decisions of the presidents as, for example, uh, the Supreme Court did in 1982 in the Northern Pipeline case about the constitutionality of, uh, judicial powers, uh, in, in that case.

Yeah, that, that’s a, that’s a great question. And I have to say that, um, remedy is not, uh, an issue that we had focused on very much, in part because, um, just, just of a, the procedural of a procedural court, the federal circuit, which re, which issued the only merits decision we have from a court of appeals, it agreed with us on the merits, but it remanded on remedy because it thought actually that, uh, the nationwide injunction in our case was too broad.

I don’t know why. They just used logic like no uniformity is required. Um, anyway, uh, and actually no one has litigated. Um, what is a really a question that, that is on the minds of a lot of people, which is what about refunds? So the, the short answer is that’s not really, you know, um, that just has not really been a piece of the case.

Certainly, I think one, like the government would, would they consider that, uh, you know. I, the a 45 day stay, I don’t know. Nobody so far has been talking about it. Um, the, the government actually said they would pay refunds. Um, uh, I, I think, you know, it’s not a part of the public case, so maybe I’ll, I’ll let you two.

Yeah, I’ll jump in. Just to say, you know, in the, in the birthright context, it was super interesting. One of the things that the US represented in that case was they would, if they won, be willing to wait 30 days to avoid chaos on the ground. And you could see the US Supreme Court asking similar questions.

Like in casa last term, we said our, uh, our opinion would not take effect for 30 days, so things could play out in the ground. As Professor Goldsmith has pointed out, that is a universal injunction, even from the Supreme Court. Uh, it doesn’t have more authority to issue universal injunctions than others.

So when it said it won’t take effect on representation for 30 days, it was a form of universal injunction, but you could easily see given how disruptive, like if, if all tariffs went away tomorrow with, with no warning, you, you could see the court having some practical concerns. I think it’s quite possible that the US has promised to pay refunds to show that it would be disruptive to take away their authority at this point.

Um, so it wouldn’t shock me to see some questions and argument trying to explore what would happen in that case, although that argument has so many. Hard merits questions that everyone is going to get that using your, your scarce argument, time and oxygen on, how long it should take after is something that probably only comes up late in the argument ’cause they’re gonna have their work cut out for them and asking all the many questions on the many topics Colleen had to work through in just summarizing the case while we’re waiting for the next question, which I hope is forthcoming, oh, we’ve got, okay, go ahead.

Sorry, I was hiding. I didn’t mean to, uh, I have a question about CASA and I almost think you shouldn’t answer it happily. Absolutely. Not necessarily for like confidentiality purposes, but because like, I feel like, you know, it, it, it’s, I just, I was in the position of having, uh, to read that through and I find that opinion endlessly confusing and I’m not quite sure what’s going on and I’m interested in the role that history is playing in it, those sorts of things. But I was wondering, you, uh, you mentioned one, like a bunch of caveats that need to get answered in the next few years that are gonna determine its scope. And I was thinking about how many, uh, equitable decisions aren’t enforced under the judicial act too. Like, uh, one of them is that, uh, like for example, the Clayton Act allows you to enforce, uh, antitrust statutes, uh, like outside of the jurisdiction of, of, of the particular district court judge.

And I wanted to know what the fact that those, uh, other statutes don’t seem to be affected by stat, uh, by CASA, seem to tell us about CASA, about it’s, uh, I think one thing that’s dubious about cost is it feels as if it feels like it’s a solution for this presidency or for the particular moment in front of us.

And I think that tension between, uh, its ruling on that statute and on others, um, might lend themselves to that sort of suspicion. But I know, I probably know what you think about CASA is what I’m trying to say, or what the other people, I want all the people to answer. I, I guess what I’m trying to say, uh, feel cold called.

You wanna go first and we can uh, I, I, I’ll go first briefly. Which, which is to say I actually think that the timing in the case in which the Supreme Court chose to issue this ruling has all sorts of complications because of what the merits is of birthright and how quickly they did it into the new administration.

But I don’t think this came just from Justices thinking this as a bespoke solution for President Trump. Like Justices Gorsuch and Barrett and Thomas were on record during the Biden years, that they had problems with these reliefs now query why there weren’t more orders in that time, if that reflected their view.

But they were on record previously. And I think, I think Colleen said something about this earlier, but I think they do sometimes think that the challengers are so focused on Trump and they’re trying to write for the presidency for all time. And so I think they think that the cost opinion is not a solution for Trump.

I think they think it is the correct response to the like institution of the executive writ large. Um, but I think a really important point you’re making, which is totally correct, and this this really did come up at oral argument, is that they know there are statutes that adopt universal forms of relief.

The administrative procedures act, certain types of, um, nationwide review schemes, uh, the Clayton Act, et cetera. And they specifically and Conspicuously wanted to avoid that because if you’re gonna strike down those statutes only come up if you’re gonna make a holding on Article three that federal courts lack this authority constitutionally rather than under the Judiciary Act of 1789.

But if you do that, Justice Kavanaugh can’t sign on because he is on record with an opinion that you can do this under the Administrative Procedures Act. So he can’t agree with the article three constitutional holding, and no one knows what the chief thinks. And so it is quite possible there isn’t a majority of even five.

Certainly there isn’t of six. To say that the constitution forecloses it, so then you just have to work with the statute in front of you and you have to leave for another day. Those other questions, so it’s a little bit path dependent in that they can’t resolve the APA question. They have a footnote saying, we’re not gonna get to the APA question.

But if you’re not gonna solve the APA question, you can’t decide it as a constitutional matter. So you have to leave other statutes for another day. But I’m curious for other folks takes on this too. Uh, yes. I’m gonna totally plagiarize one of my colleagues, Mila Sohoni, who is sort of, as Jeremy knows, one of kind of foremost experts on this.

Um, her take on this is actually that casa is gonna be, it’s gonna not have major repercussions for universal injections specifically. It’s actually gonna have its ripple effects outside of the context of universal injunctions. Part of it is sort of exactly what you’re saying, which is like. Um, I think for a long time everyone sort of said like, well, if it says equitable remedies and statutes, equity changes over time, that’s the nature of equity.

So, of course, like that means basically whatever courts want and the, and the Supreme Court seems to say like, as a textual interpretation matter, when a statute says equity, it means equity at the time of statute is passed. Um, it matters particularly under the kind of the judiciary act, um, because Mila kind of points out that, uh, Ex Parte Young right?

That, or sort of what Ex Parte Young has come to be known as. So Ex Parte Young is sort of the case that says you can, you can’t sue a state directly, but you can sue an official in the state in their official capacity and get them to do something. There is a tradition of what were called anti-suit injunctions.

So that is, you could sue the individual and say, you can’t prosecute me under this law, or you can’t do x to me. There isn’t an equitable tradition of, for instance, you have to take an affirmative step. You have to desegregate the schools, for instance, right. Um, and so if we think that, uh, CASA really means what it says, the equitable powers given to the court are frozen, uh, based on what equitable remedies were available at the time the statute was passed.

Um, I think you have a lot of issues in a lot of other areas, partly under other statutes, but even under the Judiciary Act, um, you know, like a lot of the business of civil rights litigation of the last two generations has centered on the assumption that a set of remedies are available to courts and they’re kind of equitable powers That CASA really calls into question.

I mean, I, I, I, I definitely do not think this is a bespoke solution. I think that like the, I mean, you know, having worked in the government for the last six years, you know, like, it doesn’t matter, the administration, they never like, uh, universal injunctions and I, and, and so I, I, I, I, I think this doesn’t have that valence.

Um, the other piece that I’d say is like, I think that that opinion’s hard to follow too. I’ll say that. Um, I, because of my knee-jerk government attorney reaction, I was like, obviously, uh, universal injunctions are, they’re going down. And my husband, um, who’s also a lawyer, uh, and I were in the car, he was also a government lawyer, and we were, we’re talking about this and we’re like, yeah, they’re going down.

And then we start talking about like, oh, but what about this? Oh, well, they’d have to be okay in that situation. And then we’re like, well, and what about in there? We’re like, yeah. Then they’d be okay. Then they’d be okay. And we just kept coming up with. Why they couldn’t actually have the blanket rule. And at the end of the conversation we were both like, Ooh, this is kind of like hard.

And I kind of wonder if the Supreme Court went through the same process where they thought like, finally we have a vehicle and we’re just gonna say no more universal injunctions. And then, you know, these, these doubts crept in. And, and, and it became really hard to write a clean opinion because it’s just a messy, messy issue.

So about that, and just to go to my theme, that only happens because of procedural regularity. You get full briefing on the question, you grapple with what’s hard. You hear all argument. You ask all these questions, you write an opinion and then write an opinion. And you’re like, God, this is hard. And, and I, well, Mike, small counter on that is that I think we have to be careful about fake procedural irregularity.

Like I do think when you have a full oral argument. On an, in an emergency posture, often what you are still getting is, is briefing that was written in like two weeks and, uh, judicial clerks who’ve been thinking about it for like three weeks. And, but now they are saying, well, I mean, it’s just true. That’s not a knock on anyone.

It’s just like these cases come up, they have to be decided right away and people want full process. But once you have the full process, I think it does, it does become like this is, this is like a fully measured and thought out decision. Um, and, and I just think a lot of the time because of, because of the, the need for speed, it’s not, and it makes me nervous.

To have like the oral argument and say like, now we did it, we did all of this. When, when really there’s so much more that people just haven’t had a time to think about. I think universal injunctions, that is an issue that’s been kicking around for, you know, just years and years and people have been thinking about it for years.

But a lot of the questions that the court is facing right now are huge and they’re novel and they’re difficult and like, I’m just not, I really feel for the court because I don’t know how they, how they can decide these in a way that is, you know, fair and equitable, but also respects the need for speed.

I think it’s really difficult. Can’t be always, can’t be never. And this is right, this is Justice Gorsuch, and it’s to TikTok concurrence. That is a case where they do expedited briefing, the whole argument and at the end it’s sort of nine zero to uphold the law. But Justice Gorsuch writes this concurrence.

It’s like, I mean, I guess, but I really would’ve liked to have some time to think about this. Right. Thanks for answering the question. I just wanted. We went very far afield from the question, but hopefully it’s an answer somewhere in there. So, so I thank you so much for, for the discussion. I have a question about a case that you guys have not discussed that is about, is in the doc in the emergency docket thing.

So a bit of background. So I’m a naturalized citizen and I voted for Trump few times, and yet I’m deeply concerned about the case that originated here in California that actually essentially you can be racially profiled if you’re speaking a certain way or something. And it wasn’t. So, actually it’s the first time that I feel a need to have my copy of my US passport just in case I, so the question is, we’re always carrying that with you, right?

No, yeah, yeah. Going around. Right. So is this something that is a one-off for that particular case in LA or is, uh, sets a precedent for right now it’s okay to essentially profile in the context of immigration enforcement. I’ll take a crack and then I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Um. I think that this is a case that, uh, shows some of the dangers of the emergency docket, and in particular, this is a case that shows some of the dangers of the Supreme Court doing its own kind of fact finding.

Right. So if you read the kind of Kavanaugh concurrence mm-hmm. It maybe sounds like it’s something specific to LA, sort of has all this rhetoric about things in LA um, uh, but then when you read what the district court found and what the dissenters say, it sounds like there’s really nothing specific to LA about this case.

Right. Um, and it turns out some of the, the, the things that Justice Kavanaugh says are contrary to some of the things that District Court says, even the things Justice Kavanaugh says. Right. Which is basically like, um, there are a, a lot of that’s like he says a lot of, at some point in the opinion. Right.

He says that there are a lot of people who are, um, uh, uh, undocumented in Los Angeles, like, doesn’t give us a numerical threshold. It’s actually, it turns out to be like a pretty small percentage of Los Angeles. Mm-hmm. Um. So I guess I would say I, uh, I think that Justice Kavanaugh thought he was making a ruling about la I don’t know how it gets KA to LA.

Um, and so that’s like n neither, not, not particularly helpful, but just I would not put that away. Yeah. It’s very sad actually. I mean, I, I, that cases, that cases, um, I agree a great example of the perils of the emergency docket, but I’ll, I’ll, I’ll say something different about it. So that case was, was always going to be hard for the challengers because of, uh, a procedural issue, which is that there was well established doctrine around standing that made it particularly hard to challenge law enforcement search policies that you couldn’t show sufficiently were gonna be applied to you prospectively.

That’s been the law for some time in a case called Lyons. And so it was understood, I think that the challengers were gonna have a hard time on standing and on the fact that they got a class action in that case, um, because it kind of turns on the different facts that that might be applied to you. And I think what surpri and, and what surprised a lot of folks was that Justice Kavanaugh could have stopped there and chose to go further and talk about the merits of this policy when, if he’s right, that there’s no standing, there’s no re the court mm-hmm.

Should not be talking about the merits in a case it finds no jurisdiction to reach. Um, and I think it was, it was difficult for a lot of people because among other things, no one knows if he’s means to be speaking for the court and himself is frustrated. The court is not sharing views. I mean, Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who is most vocally saying, we should be explaining ourselves active and often, uh, on the emergency docket.

Now, it’s helpful when you’re one of the swing justices to say that because they mostly reflect your views compared to others. Not always, but often. More often. And, um, and so it’s easier to say, we should be explaining ourselves when they’re your views, but no one knows because the court doesn’t explain if it’s just doing a standing only it has issues with the policy, but it thought there wasn’t standing.

Mm-hmm. And there wasn’t an appropriate class and what have you. Or if there are. Five or six justices who agree with everything in that concurrence. And that’s one of the things that I think has frustrated folks about the emergency docket is this weird combination of one justices views and you have no idea who to attribute them to and why it went into the merits when there was a standing issue all along.

I’ll just say that even if it’s just the standing issue, that’s still pretty devastating for kind of checks on police. Um, so it is, as Jeremy said, it has been true for many years. This case, Lyons was a case about a choke hold policy in the Los Angeles Police Department. Supreme Court said, um, you don’t an up standing person who was subjected to a choke hold to challenge this because, um, who knows if this will happen to you again, in this case, the challengers compiled evidence of multiple plaintiffs who had multiple times themselves been arrested, right?

So they could say with some certainty like this has already happened to me twice. I have, I think it’s likely to happen again. And they had some concrete harms, right? So in Lions, this prior case, the court says, well, you haven’t had to change anything about your behavior to avoid being put into a choke hold.

You’re going about your business. And the challengers here said like, no, we’re not. Right? We’re, we’re having to carry around a copy of our passport everywhere we go. Yeah. Um, and so I think even if it’s just a standing opinion, even if nothing else that Justice Kavanaugh said stands for the view of the court, it will change dramatically the ability of civil rights practitioners to try to constrain any sort of law enforcement conduct.

Because I think it goes significantly farther than lions. And I think that alone will mean that there’s more unchecked police and ice enforcement. Thank you all three for the question. Last question. Thank you. Uh, this question may be a little bit different, but I think it’s interesting, especially for the students and the non-lawyers in the room.

You were all, uh, clerks to Supreme Court Justices. Can you talk a little bit about what the role of the clerk is, your interactions with the justices, your. Influence or lack thereof on decisions and just sort of demystify that process for those of us who have never been Supreme Court clerks. Yeah, and actually you’ve got a pretty, I think, a, like, pretty good cross section of the role of the clerks across the three of us.

Um, I would, I would like to say, um, I dunno, Colleen, do you wanna start? We can go online. Um, sure. Uh, so I, I clerked for the chief, um, uh, and uh, the, one of the great things about clerking for the chief was there were no bench memos. Um, the chief did everything, um, orally. Uh, so we spent a lot of our time talking to the chief Justice about, um, all of the cases in front of the Supreme Court at the time.

Uh, and I think, you know, the role of the clerk in the chief’s office is sort of, um, sounding board researcher. Uh, he, you know, I, I think I have always said that the chief is, is an amazing boss. And he really was, uh, he trusted us and gave us a lot of, um, autonomy and he let us know that he was, was listening to us.

At the same time, he made all of his decisions himself. I mean, I think I was seeing, saying earlier, anybody who says that like they were responsible for their justices opinions is, you know, I think suffering from delusions of grand grandeur. Uh, you know, I, I actually, when I was clerking, I remember thinking, why did they hire me?

Because I don’t really know that much about the law. And they could be using like, you know, practitioners who’ve been in, in practice for a long time and actually, you know, would have useful knowledge. But I think that’s the point, right? You’re, you’re taking a young lawyer who, when you’re dealing with them and you’re a justice and you’ve been dealing with the law for, for decades, you’re not gonna be.

Get, get confused and think, oh, let me let this, you know, person who just graduated from law school make all of these important decisions, not me. I trust them. Right. And it’s, it’s a useful check in that sense. But I do think you’re like a, a fresh voice. You are, um, you’re your research, but you’re also, you know, a different take, a different perspective.

Um, you know, I think something I really admired about the, the, the chief, and I think the justice is just, is he, he really listened, he did not always agree, or maybe not most of the time agree with what I had to say, but I felt like he really listened and that, and what I was saying went into his, um, decision making process.

Uh, so I actually agree with, with almost all of that. So maybe I’ll just add three, three observations. The first is probably, actually none of us are a particularly good gauge anymore because, um. The emergency docket I would date. We can have a longer conversation about this. I think it actually sort of like the current in its current form kind of started our term clerking.

Um, but the amount of time that the law clerks now spend on the emergency docket just bears no resemblance to when any of us was clerking. So I actually have no idea what’s happening in that building anymore. How they’re sleeping, when they’re sleeping, what’s happening. Um, uh, uh, so take all this with a grain of salt.

Um, the second thing I’ll say that I think is a little bit different about the Clark and Bridge. So Sotomayor, who’s my former boss, is, um, she views her role as much outside the building as inside the building. So she cares deeply about the cases. Read any one of her impassioned dissent, and you will see that she also recognizes that in some ways her role as an ambassador for the court and an inspiration to young people is a way that she will make change that is different from what, what she writes and what she says at conference.

Um, so again, both in kind of the way she writes her dissents, right? She’s speaking to a much broader audience and the amount of time that she spends on like public appearances, like she would, you know, she’d like get invited to something and she’d be like, ask her judicial assistant to pull out the file of like, anyone who’d like written a letter to her from that town so she could invite them to the event, right?

I had the pleasure of going with her to these events where she’s treated like, like a rock star. Like people cry when they like reach out to touch her. Um, and so it was a really interesting lesson for me in, as someone who thought about a judge, like, your source of power is like what you, your, the votes that you cast in conference to think about, to work for a justice, who really saw her role as much broader than that.

About inspiring people, about being a voice for the court to, to on, on behalf of people who didn’t always have a voice on the court and, and writing and kind of allocating her time in that way. Um, and the final thing I’ll say is, um, here’s the really weird thing about being a clerk is, um, you know, all of us now practice before the court where we clerked.

Um, and it’s like a very, very strangely insular club. So Justice Sotomayor for instance, officiated my wedding, like one of the first people who met my son when he came out of the hospital. Um, and I remember the first case I went up to argue, I was talking to a friend of mine who’s a, a public defender in New York, and she was like, oh my God, if I were in front of a judge where who had officiated the prosecutor’s wedding who didn’t recuse themselves, I would be livid, right?

Um, but that’s just not the vibe. Um, and I don’t know a way to sort of justify or explain that, just to say that. I, I think one thing I hadn’t fully realized until going through the clerkship process is just how small this world is and how many, uh, deeply close ties the justices have to the advocates appearing before them.

I don’t have a ton to add beyond that. Uh, I, I’ll second what everyone is saying, which is the clerks really don’t make the decisions. The justices really do make the decisions. I felt that confidently when I clerked for Justice Kagan, and she very much wanted clerks to push back on her ideas and make them better and find holes and poke holes.

And in a case, like there are some cases that are really 51-49 cases, especially like non-ideological ones, and you can like help shape an opinion or get more caveats or nuance into a take because you’ve pushed back in a certain way. The justices are voting on their cases and the justices know how to figure them out.

And I mean, Justice Kagan is, you know, basically one of the smartest people I’ll ever interact with in my entire life. And I didn’t have a lot that I could tell her that she couldn’t figure out. But justices are also busy people and so I was plucking enough to try to keep pushing back on a variety of cases.

And so it made for like an incredibly intense and incredibly fulfilling year. But I think mostly like the clerks get to learn from the experience more than they’re really teaching the justices and look in a case that’s poorly briefed, clerks can have a valuable role in helping find things that the parties are not presenting so that ",https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/supreme-court-roundup-and-preview-4.png,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:27.181475

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does.
The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago.
As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough.
But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department.","President Trump is celebrating the anniversary of his return to power by accelerating his attack on the rule of law. He has spent the week leading up to Jan. 20 using the mighty powers of the Justice Department as an extension of his personal and political interests. The department has started a fabricated criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair, searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and created a White House-controlled fraud unit that would streamline partisan prosecution.

Mr. Trump does not attempt to hide his use of law enforcement powers for vengeance. He glories in it. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, he hosted federal prosecutors at the White House and complained that they were not moving fast enough to punish the rivals, critics and truth tellers he wished to target. This followed months of pressure by the president on his attorney general to do more to prosecute those who oppose his actions and those who tried to hold him accountable under the law in the past.

These efforts have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s second term, and it can be easy to become numb to them. We urge you not to. His usurpation of law enforcement power threatens us all. His meddling with the independence of the Fed undermines the economy. His attacks on members of Congress and the news media threaten people’s right to speak freely and hold the government accountable. His move to control investigation and prosecution from the White House portends an America where the state uses force to promote the political interests of its leaders, rather than uphold the laws passed by our representatives.

One year into his second term, America risks losing a central feature of our democracy: that we are a country ruled by laws, not by one man.

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does. Consider the situation in Minnesota that attracted so much of the nation’s attention in recent days. On Jan. 7 an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot to death Renee Good, who was protesting ICE’s raids in Minneapolis. Under any other modern president, the next steps would have been clear. The government would have conducted a sober-minded inquiry about whether the agent had acted appropriately.

Under Mr. Trump, the verdict was preordained. The ICE agents on the scene prevented a bystander who identified himself as a doctor from treating Ms. Good as she sat slumped and bleeding in her car. The ICE agent who shot her sped away shortly afterward, videos suggest. Mr. Trump quickly posted a misleading description of the confrontation on social media. Later that day, the F.B.I. barred state investigators from joining them in collecting and analyzing evidence from the scene.

Senior Trump officials accused Ms. Good of “domestic terrorism,” and the Justice Department made a mockery of itself by opening an investigation into Ms. Good and her partner for their political activism. At least 10 federal lawyers in Washington and Minnesota have since resigned or retired. Their response is honorable, although it leaves even fewer principled officials to stand up to future abuses.

The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago. Still, between Richard Nixon’s resignation in disgrace and Mr. Trump’s second term, the department under both political parties took steps to remain independent from the White House so that Americans could have confidence that federal law enforcement was nonpartisan. If the government investigated somebody — or decided not to — the reasonable assumption was that it was on the merits. That assumption is in tatters, as the events in Minneapolis demonstrate.

After hollowing out the functions of the federal government’s system of justice that ensure fairness and guard against misconduct, the Trump administration has turned what remains into the agent of Mr. Trump’s personal and political impulses. If you are on the president’s side, you will be protected and even pardoned of crimes. If you threaten his interests, you risk retribution from federal law enforcement.

On Sunday, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the Justice Department had served him with subpoenas in a bogus criminal investigation. The department claimed it was looking into whether he had misled Congress about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters, but he said he had provided exhaustive details to Congress and had the bank’s internal watchdog examine the construction costs. Mr. Trump’s real motive is obvious. He wants to replace the Fed’s leadership with officials who betray its tradition of independence from partisan politics and rapidly cut interest rates to goose the economy before midterm elections this year. The targeting of Mr. Powell, who will leave his role in May, serves to remind his successor that there is a cost to independence.

Three days after Mr. Powell’s announcement, federal agents took the extraordinary step of searching the home of Hannah Natanson, a reporter for The Washington Post, and seizing her phone as part of a leak investigation. This violates traditional government policy and appears designed to chill valuable reporting by making sources nervous about talking to journalists. Ms. Natanson had helped expose some of the negative consequences of the Trump administration’s policies.

The list of Trump critics and opponents who face or have faced legal action by the administration also includes another Fed governor, Lisa Cook; the former F.B.I. director James Comey; Attorney General Letitia James of New York; Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California; and Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California. This month Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would begin administrative proceedings against Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona — which could result in the reduction of Mr. Kelly’s military retirement rank and pension — after the senator participated in a video urging military service members to resist illegal orders. The five other Democratic lawmakers who participated in the video said they are also under federal investigation. On Monday, Mr. Kelly sued Mr. Hegseth and the Pentagon on free-speech grounds.

At the same time, a parade of actual criminals who curry Mr. Trump’s favor receive clemency, and investigations into suspicious behavior by his cronies are canceled or never opened. Many of the president’s uses of the pardon power seem partly aimed at diminishing confidence in legitimate past prosecutions — and trying to make previous administrations look as unethical as the current one.

Janet Yellen, a former Fed chair and Treasury secretary, summed up this inversion of the basic principles of American justice: “If you can bring charges for no reason whatsoever against your enemies, we’re no longer living in a society governed by the rule of law,” she said.

More than 200 of the department’s career lawyers have been fired, and thousands more have resigned. “I wouldn’t even call it the Justice Department anymore,” Dena Robinson, a lawyer who formerly worked in the civil rights division, said last year. “It’s become Trump’s personal law firm.”

The administration crossed another line last week when Vice President JD Vance announced that the White House would run an unnecessary new Justice Department division on fraud. The department already has an anti-fraud section, but it has been depleted by administration cutbacks; what’s different about this new division is that the White House controls it directly. The new outpost is particularly suspicious, given Mr. Trump’s loose and expedient definition of fraudulent behavior as occurring only in states run by Democrats. The announcement suggests it will be another piece of his partisan use of legal powers. For now, the new division is centered on the social-service fraud that has occurred in Minnesota, though he has his eyes on other Democratic states as well.

The Minnesota fraud is real, and the people who perpetrated it deserve to face charges. Many already have; one of the prosecutors who resigned Tuesday over the response to the ICE shooting had overseen the sprawling investigation. But Mr. Trump’s interest in fraud is selective, applying exclusively in jurisdictions that have opposed him. As KFF Health News reported, he gave pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud-related crimes during his first and second terms. And he fired or demoted more than 20 inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud.

As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough. Several Republicans in the House and Senate have said they do not believe Mr. Powell is a criminal, and Senator Thom Tillis said he would oppose the confirmation of any Fed governor until the investigation is concluded.

But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department. Some seem to grasp the danger to the economy of having Trump control the Fed, but they need to see the larger picture and grasp the danger to democracy of controlling law enforcement, too. On behalf of Americans who are now living without a functioning system of federal law and order, Congress should step up and end this self-interested destruction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/opinion/17vengeance-editorial-image/17vengeance-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 01:58:09.869115

On Jan. 9, two days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent’s shooting of Renee Good sent tensions in Minneapolis to a fever pitch, the Department of Homeland Security posted to social media an image of a man on a horse riding through a snowy, mountainous landscape with the words “We’ll have our home again.” That’s the chorus to a song about ousting a foreign presence by a self-described “folk-punk” band that the Proud Boys and other far-right and white supremacist groups have used.

The next day, the Department of Labor posted on X: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.” Several Trump critics on the social media site drew a parallel to a notorious Nazi slogan, “One People, One Realm, One Leader.”

And this past week, as President Donald Trump stepped up his pressure campaign to claim Greenland, the White House posted an image on X that showed a dog sled facing a fork in the trail, one that leads to an American flag and the White House and another that leads to the Russian and Chinese flags. Above the image was the phrase, “Which way, Greenland Man?”

The post refers to a meme that riffs off the title of a notorious white supremacist book titled “Which Way Western Man?” The administration had already used the framing in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruiting post last year, which asked, “Which way, American Man?”

The flurry of posts has renewed criticism about a recurring pattern in Trump’s second term — the sometimes cryptic use of imagery popular with the far right and white supremacists in the administration’s campaign to rally the nation behind its immigration crackdown, which it frames as a battle to preserve Western civilization.

Administration tells critics to ‘get a grip’

The administration says it’s tired of criticism that its messaging is framed around white supremacy or Nazi slogans.

“It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: The deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.”

Referring to the “We’ll Have Our Home Again” post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said it “was a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.”

“I don’t know where you guys are getting this stuff,” she added, “but it is absurd.”

César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University, said the administration’s references are a choice.

“You don’t have to dip into white supremacist sloganeering to promote immigration regulation,” he said, noting that former President Bill Clinton signed two bills toughening penalties on immigrants who were in the country illegally in the 1990s without doing so.

He added that the administration seems to calibrate its references.

“The imagery is not simply a reproduction of common white supremacist imagery or text, but a play on that imagery — and that gives them the breathing room they want,” Garcia Hernández said.

Trump won his second term with robust support from Latino voters and increased his backing among both Black and Asian voters, all while running on pledges of tough border enforcement and mass deportations.

Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own.

The president has complained that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and spoken favorably about white immigrants compared to other immigrants. In his first term, he bemoaned the number of immigrants coming from what he called “shithole countries” such as Haiti or ones in Africa, while wondering why the U.S. doesn’t draw more people from Norway. Last month, he called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

Trump changed immigration policy to favor whites in one area by shutting down the admission of refugees except for white South Africans, whom he contends, against evidence, are being discriminated against in their home country.

Online appeal for the far right

Some of Trump’s most prominent supporters have openly embraced the cause of white nationalists.

Elon Musk, who was Trump’s biggest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign and ran the president’s Department of Government Efficiency for the first part of last year, recirculated a user post on X, the social platform he owns, that called for “white solidarity” to prevent the mass murder of white men and added a “100” emoji indicating agreement.

The administration’s history has led to claims that it’s using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it.

In the aftermath of the Good shooting in Minnesota, a sign that appeared on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s lectern during a news conference — reading “One Of Ours, All Of Yours” — drew widespread attention on social media, with many commentators suggesting it was a Nazi phrase. The Southern Poverty Law Center, however, could not trace the words to any Nazi slogan.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said it was a reference to the subject of the press conference: “a CBP officer who was shot — he was one of our officers and all of the country’s federal law enforcement officer,” she wrote in an email.

Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it’s doing with its messaging slogans.

“They know their base is this overly online right-winger who they know will go nuts if they say ‘Which Way, Western Man?’” Gais said. “I don’t think it’s a tenable strategy for the long term because the stuff is incomprehensible to most people. And if it is comprehensible, people don’t like it.”

In the public's view, he failed to resolve one of the two major issues that elected him, the increasing unaffordability of day-to-day life. And he created grave doubts about his methods to curb illegal immigration.

As president, Trump bears ultimate responsibility for his administration's misdeeds, many of which face legal challenges.

But three top appointees — Stephen Miller, Russell Vought and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are, along with the president, the architects of the most damaging aspects of Trump 2.0. Most other top officials are primarily enablers.

Here is a rundown:

› MILLER. Miller has been the main architect of Trump's anti-immigration policies and efforts to curb civil rights programs and other so-called ""woke"" policies, both within the government and beyond it.

He set numerical targets for deporting illegal immigrants that led to detention and deportation of some legal residents and citizens.

Though descended from Jewish immigrants who fled Eastern Europe, Miller encouraged policies ending asylum for victims of repression and eliminating most legal immigration.

He was also a principal architect of the legally questionable effort to send federal and National Guard troops into major cities in the name of reducing crime and assisting deportation efforts.

Miller also urged overthrowing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and threatening Greenland's independence.

› VOUGHT. As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Vought picked up where Elon Musk left off in slashing federal personnel and programs, especially those that helped the poor.

The mastermind behind many of the conservative Project 2025 recommendations that form the basis of Trump's second-term policies, Vought has long believed the executive branch can refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. A Supreme Court test looms.

Vought contends the president has total authority over the executive branch and can fire members of semi-independent commissions and others who oppose his policies.

He encouraged the sharp cutback in federal health and food programs, emergency and foreign aid programs. He also unilaterally blocked funds for environmental projects in Democratic-run states.

› KENNEDY. As secretary of health and human services, he implemented an array of damaging policies reflecting his long-held contrarian beliefs after promising senators he would weigh scientific expertise.

His appointees at the Centers for Disease Control encouraged those who contend without evidence that many vaccines are unsafe and may jeopardize long-term health for millions.

This year has already seen the first two significant outbreaks in a generation of measles, likely exacerbated by Kennedy's refusal to support anti-measles vaccinations.

More recently, his department revised guidelines for what American should eat, against eating processed foods and sugary drinks and reversing decades of warnings that over-consumption of red meats, butter and whole milk contribute to heart disease.

Kennedy also canceled billions of dollars for research, including hundreds of clinical trials, but Congress is reversing his actions.

Trump, himself, initiated many questionable policies, from seeking to end birthright citizenship to imposing import tariffs, ordering prosecution of longtime critics and encouraging fossil fuels while dismantling projects using alternate fuels.

His campaign of breaking norms and imposing his own instinctual views has inspired a spate of lawsuits. Their outcome will ultimately determine the extent of long-term damage by the most unpopular re-elected president in U.S. history.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2026/01/18/103909884_OPED-LEUBSDORF-COLUMN-GET--2-_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:32.056223

Abigail Spanberger signed 10 executive actions that broadly targeted affordability and pushed the commonwealth away from former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's approaches to education, immigration and race.

She also signed an action that delegates broad emergency and day-to-day authority to Bonnie Krenz-Schnurman, her longtime chief of staff, hours after taking Virginia's high office.

The orders also put the risks to Virginia's economy and budget posed by federal funding cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump in the public discussion more so than under the previous administration.

""Today, we are responding to the moment. We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results,"" said Spanberger in a statement.

While governors do not have the power to appropriate funds, Spanberger's executive orders also reflected her and top Democrats' apparent preference to avoid using Virginia's general fund to lower costs and raise wages, arguing that raising taxes is another cost for families.

Spanberger, who is also the first woman to be elected Virginia's governor, did not take questions from the press after signing all 10 actions.

The directives on affordability were to identify cost savings for families, which state-facilitated services are most at risk due to federal policies, and finding housing regulations that may be cut in order to spur new home and apartment construction.

The executive order named housing, health care, energy, education, child care and living expenses like groceries as areas of particular concern. Health care and identifying potential ways to loosen housing regulations got their own executive orders.

In the order on health care funding, Spanberger created an ""Interagency Health Financing Task Force"" to coordinate health care financing and sort out all the various funding risks posed by the congressional passage of HR1. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians are at risk of losing their health care or being priced out due to the bill's provisions.

It also includes a review of Managed Care Organizations, a key part of Medicaid services in the commonwealth. Recently, a forecast from the Department of Medical Assistance Services said that MCOs would need an additional $3.2 billion in state funds to maintain current services for the 1.6 million Virginians enrolled, according to December data from DMAS.

The underlying challenges for Spanberger and Virginia's tight spending plan, given rising education and health care costs, compound the limitations of state government according to Terry Clower, director of George Mason's Center for Regional Analysis.

""Saying that 'we are going to make affordability better for you in the short run' is really hard for government to do, and particularly state government,"" Clower told VPM News in an interview Friday.

Virginia normally conforms to federal tax law on a ""rolling"" basis, with some exceptions. However, state lawmakers paused that conformity in 2025 in light of the federal cuts to taxes that could have trickle-down effects on Virginia's tax collections — to the tune of billions of dollars.

Democrats said during the opening of the General Assembly session they would not look to conform to many of new federal tax law's provisions.

Spanberger directed Virginia's agencies to identify what risks the federal government's policies will have in one order. Clower noted that tariffs have an inflationary effect, immigration crackdowns could affect labor costs and availability, and jobs connected to the federal government are affected.

""We've also seen a trend now for professional business services jobs that are declining,"" he said. The effects ""are crossing different levels of households, so you're creating some pressures in the economy.""

Higher education governance also got special attention. Executive Order 6 requires recommendations for legislative or policy changes to how board of visitor members are appointed or selected. It follows tumult at University of Virginia (Spanberger's alma mater) and resignations of at least three board members shortly before Saturday's inauguration.

In the order's wording, Spanberger cited federal interference as the need for the changes: ""These pressures underscore the urgent need for the Commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.""

That is but one of a few departures from the approach of Youngkin's administration to university governance.

The new governor's Day 1 EOs also give specific mention to diversity and opportunity. Executive Order 4 mentions ""inclusive"" education and closing ""opportunity gaps,"" while EO 9 tells agencies to take ""affirmative measures … to emphasize the recruitment of qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at all levels of state government.""

It heavily contrasts with the tone of Youngkin's administration, which praised the closure of DEI offices. In 2023 Martin D. Brown, Youngkin's chief diversity officer (whose title did not include the word ""equity""), declared that ""DEI is dead"" during a talk at Virginia Military Institute.

Spanberger also is rescinding a controversial executive order of Youngkin's that directed state and local law enforcement to pursue immigration-related enforcement duties. Executive Order 10 does not withdraw from existing 287(g) agreements, according to Spanberger Communications Director Libby Wiet.

It solely rescinds Youngkin's issued mandate — which directed Virginia's law enforcement agencies to become federally deputized for immigration enforcement and opened up Departments of Corrections facilities for immigrants' federal processing and detention.

Spanberger also issued orders that outline expanded powers for her chief of staff; Krenz-Schnurman has served as the newly installed governor's chief of staff since her first term in Congress.

Those EO- designated powers include budgetary and administrative roles (EO 8), as well as the limited ability to call forth the Virginia National Guard (EO 7) or declare a state of emergency if Spanberger is ""unable to be reached.""

Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.
""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community.
The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.
Fears in El Paso immigrant community Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.","El Paso County Sheriff Oscar Ugarte met residents at a townhall meeting to explain an agreement to work with expanding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

Dozens of residents attended the meeting on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramírez Community Center in Sparks to hear Ugarte explain what will happen now that El Paso County is required by Texas state law to join the national 287(g) program to cooperate with ICE enforcement operations.

Ugarte explained that he was given three options for what type of agreement that his office could enter. Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.

""We picked this model because we believe that it will have the least affect on our community,"" Ugarte told residents. ""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community. We don't want that. We don't (want) our community to be scared.""

The townhall was organized by the Border Network for Human Rights, an El Paso-based immigrant advocacy group. There was no way for El Paso to avoid being forced to participate, Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the BNHR, told attendees, because the county could be sued if they do not ""comply.""

The county must now join the 287(g) program with ICE after SB 8 went into effect on Jan. 1. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill into law in June 2025 requiring all counties that operate a jail or contracts with a private vendor to operate a jail in Texas to sign one of three types of agreements with ICE: the Warrant Service Officer, the Jail Enforcement Model and the Task Force Model.

Over 225 counties in Texas already have signed agreements with ICE, according to the ICE's 287(g) program website. Only one county in New Mexico is participating in the program, the Curry County Sheriff's Office in Clovis.

ICE agents already had access to inmates detained in the El Paso County Jail due to a 2017 law that required them to work with federal agents.

Ugarte — a first generation American and Democrat who just completed his first year in office as sheriff — expressed his opposition to being forced to sign any new agreement throughout the townhall. The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.

""As local law enforcement, we have enough issues to deal with already,"" Ugarte said following the event. ""We don't have the resources, we don't have the manpower, we don't have the budget. Do I believe that local law enforcement should be focused on federal immigration laws? Absolutely not.""

Fears in El Paso immigrant community

Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.

The questions from residents ranged between how his office had received emergency calls reporting federal agents, how would his office address racial profiling and what to do if federal agents leave a child behind after detaining their guardians, among many other questions.

Ugarte said that any emergency calls will be treated as any other call, but if the person identifies themselves as a federal agent, there isn't much deputies can do. He requested that residents do not protest at a close distance and not interfere with federal agents. He also pointed out that these policies were the result of the 2024 elections, and reminded residents to show their anger through voting.

The questions reflected the concerns of many residents of the Borderland, many of whom are immigrants and still have loved one who cross the border regularly.

There is fear in the community, Alfredo Agüero, a resident of El Paso, said after the townhall. The 68-year-old U.S. citizen was born in Juárez and was one of about 20 people to ask a question of the sheriff, asking how can residents have confidence that these masked individuals are actual federal agents when they do not identify themselves or present identifications and how the community can have confidence in the sheriff.

The sheriff's answer that there was nothing he could do did not ease his concerns, he said.

""I feel like we are in the same spot,"" Agüero said. ""The answers we received is that they can do whatever they want. It is not fair.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/17/PTX1/88236521007-lt-sheriff-oscar-ugarte-10.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-18 02:57:07.141749

A group of local unions in Minnesota, meanwhile, has endorsed a planned statewide economic blackout in response to ICE actions in the state.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, first announced its endorsement alongside other regional bodies on Friday.

""The Minnesota labor movement is united against the violent ICE occupation of our beloved cities that has directly impacted union members, our workplaces and our families,"" the group said in a press release.

Dozens of community, faith, and union groups are organizing the Day of Truth and Freedom, a call to action asking Minnesotans to avoid work, school, and shopping on January 23 to pause the economy. There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.

""We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,"" organizers said in a Facebook post.

Organizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.

""Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,"" the group said in a statement.

Thousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.

""Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,"" she said.

The Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called ""sanctuary"" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create ""a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence."" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.

Business Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.

Many residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.

Days after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.

""As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,"" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.

Homeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.

Business and Legal Community Mobilize Against Immigrant-Visa Freeze

Within hours of the State Department’s announcement, business coalitions, immigration lawyers and civil-rights organizations began crafting legal and lobbying strategies to overturn or narrow the new immigrant-visa suspension. In an editorial titled “Echoes of 1924,” the Economic Times argued that framing the freeze as an anti-welfare measure masks a broader attempt to slash lawful immigration levels. Advocacy groups likened the policy to the National Origins Quota Act, warning of talent shortfalls in STEM fields.

Several multinational employers told reporters they are exploring emergency L-1 intracompany transfers and E-2 treaty visas to keep high-value employees on projects scheduled to launch in Q2. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) confirmed it is assembling plaintiffs for a potential injunction, citing due-process violations and harm to U.S. businesses. Meanwhile, diversity-visa (DV-2026) winners from Sudan, Sierra Leone and Laos have organized online forums to crowd-fund litigation before their visas expire on September 30.

For individuals and corporations scrambling to adjust their plans, VisaHQ can be a practical lifeline. The platform (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/) offers real-time embassy updates, customized document checklists, and step-by-step assistance for alternative visa routes such as L-1 or E-2, helping HR teams and foreign nationals keep projects on track while the courts decide the fate of the suspension.

Corporate response: Global-mobility teams are reassessing succession plans and may shift onboarding centers to Canada or Mexico to await adjudication. Recruiters note that prolonged uncertainty could push foreign graduates of U.S. universities to competitors in the U.K. and Australia. HR leaders are urging Congress to clarify that employment-based immigrants with employer affidavits of support should be exempt from the ""public-charge"" rationale.

Next steps: Observers expect the first lawsuits to be filed in federal district courts within the next two weeks. If an injunction is granted, consular processing could resume temporarily, but practitioners caution that injunctions may apply only to named plaintiffs or limited jurisdictions.

VisaHQ's expert visas and immigration team helps individuals and companies navigate global travel, work, and residency requirements. We handle document preparation, application filings, government agencies coordination, every aspect necessary to ensure fast, compliant, and stress-free approvals.

The shop owner says she sought asylum in the U.S. several years ago. Now she’s worried about herself and her two children.

L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman called the incident “unacceptable” in an office-wide memo sent out on Friday evening.

“A member of our Office was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I can thankfully report that, shortly after, our employee was released and is safe,” Hochman wrote. “This incident is unacceptable. Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity. This troubling situation caused great distress to our colleague, our co-worker’s family, and our entire Office family.”

The reason for the person’s detention was not immediately clear. A spokesman for Hochman declined to comment further and referred questions to ICE. Representatives for ICE did not respond to inquiries from The Times. .

Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly, said the employee was not a prosecutor. The employee was also not engaged in protest activity, the officials said.

In the e-mail, Hochman said he personally reached out to federal authorities on Friday to make them aware of the situation and “urge them to be more respectful of the rights of those who reside in our community and ensure this wrongful conduct does not occur again.”

In the months since ICE and Border Patrol agents began carrying out President Trump’s sweeping immigration raids in U.S. cities, civil liberties groups have repeatedly sued the Department of Justice alleging agents are making stops based on race rather than reasonable suspicion.

County, a federal judge in October found sufficient evidence that agents were violating the 4th Amendment by relying on the race, language and vocation of targeted individuals to form “reasonable suspicion” for arrest.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d131c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7929x4163+0+548/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2Fe7%2F73c28b53419a828579bb0b64f29b%2F1511530-me-nathan-hochman-portrait-cmh-05.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 21:58:13.619836

Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.","MINNEAPOLIS(AP) — Work starts around sunrise for many of the federal officers carrying out the immigration crackdown in and around the Twin Cities, with hundreds of people in tactical gear emerging from a bland office building near the main airport.

Within minutes, hulking SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans begin leaving, forming the unmarked convoys that have quickly become feared and common sights in the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their suburbs.

Protesters also arrive early, braving the cold to stand across the street from the fenced-in federal compound, which houses an immigration court and government offices. “Go home!” they shout as convoys roar past. ""ICE out!”

Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people.

“We’re not going anywhere!” a woman shouted on a recent morning. “We’re here until you leave.”

This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, the Trump administration's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, sparked daily clashes between activists and immigration officers in the deeply liberal cities, and left a mother of three dead.

The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. And even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force.

Still, the surge can be felt across broad swaths of the Twin Cities area, which is home to more than 3 million people.

“We don’t use the word ‘invasion’ lightly,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, noting that his police force has just 600 officers. “What we are seeing is thousands — plural, thousands — of federal agents coming into our city.”

Those agents have an outsized presence in a small city.

It can take hours to drive across Los Angeles and Chicago, both targets of Trump administration crackdowns. It can take 15 minutes to cross Minneapolis.

So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily.

Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy.

At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of “current conditions.”

A dozen blocks away at the Karmel Mall, where the city’s large Somali community goes for everything from food and coffee to tax preparation, signs on the doors warn, “No ICE enter without court order.”

The shadow of George Floyd

It’s been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw.

Floyd was killed just blocks from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good “weaponized” her vehicle. City and state officials dismiss those explanations and point to multiple bystander videos of the confrontation.

For Twin Cities residents, the crackdown can feel overwhelming.

“Enough is enough,” said Johan Baumeister, who came to the scene of Good’s death soon after the shooting to lay flowers.

He said he didn’t want to see the violent protests that shook Minneapolis after Floyd’s death, causing billions of dollars in damage. But this city has a long history of activism and protests, and he had no doubt there would be more.

“I think they’ll see Minneapolis show our rage again,” he predicted.

He was right.

In the days since, there have been repeated confrontations between activists and immigration officers. Most amounted to little more than shouted insults and taunting, with destruction mostly limited to broken windows, graffiti and some badly damaged federal vehicles.

But angry clashes now flare regularly across the Twin Cities. Some protesters clearly want to provoke the federal officers, throwing snowballs at them or screaming obscenities through bullhorns from just a couple feet away. The serious force, though, comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Immigrants and citizens have been yanked from cars and homes and detained, sometimes for days. And most clashes end in tear gas.

Drivers in Minneapolis or St. Paul can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles.

Shovel your neighbor’s walk

In a state that prides itself on its decency, there’s something particularly Minnesotan about the protests,

Soon after Good was shot, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities.

“It might be shoveling your neighbor’s walk,” he said. “It might mean being at a food bank. It might be pausing to talk to someone you haven’t talked to before.”

He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder.

And when protests do become clashes, residents will often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes.

Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they're picking up their children. They take care packages to people too afraid to go out, and arrange rides for them to work and doctor's visits.

On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in St. Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Colin Anderson, the group’s outreach director, said the group has seen a surge in requests.

Sometimes, people don’t even understand what has happened to them.

Like Christian Molina from suburban Coon Rapids, who was driving through a Minneapolis neighborhood on a recent day, taking his car to a mechanic, when immigration officers began following him. He wonders if it's because he looks Hispanic.

They turned on their siren, but Molina kept driving, unsure who they were.

Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Two emerged and asked Molina for his papers. He refused, saying he’d wait for the police. Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.

So the officers left.

They left behind an angry, worried man who suddenly owned a sedan with a mangled rear fender.

Long after the officers were gone he had one final question.

“Who’s going to pay for my car?”

At another school, volunteer Joe Dirkswager stood watch, nodding at passing vehicles. Miles away in St. Paul, Matthew Kearns was questioning unfamiliar individuals near the school he graduated from decades ago.

The three are among the volunteers who have begun patrolling streets around elementary and high schools in the Twin Cities, using walkie-talkies, Signal group chats and whistles to warn families and school staff of immigration enforcement activities. The informal patrols have emerged amid a sharp surge of federal immigration personnel in Minnesota and the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer last week.

On Thursday afternoon, about two dozen adults lined the perimeter of Green Central Elementary School in central Minneapolis, just blocks from where Good was killed. Patrol volunteers scanned nearby streets and relayed updates in real time.

The father, Greg, a 42-year-old who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns for his family, said the patrols have forced families into impossible decisions on a daily basis.

“Every morning I feel like I’m forced with the choice of ‘Do I try to do patrol to protect my daughter and her preschool or do I come to my son’s kindergarten to do patrol here?’” he asked.

“Those are the kind of choices that the community is being faced with.”

Greg and eight other volunteers who spoke with NBC News said the patrols are especially aimed at protecting parents and school staff who are not U.S. citizens and fear being detained while coming and going from schools.

More than 3,000 federal immigration personnel have descended on Minnesota in recent weeks, and more than 2,500 undocumented immigrants have been apprehended in Minneapolis since November, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The enforcement push — dubbed Operation Metro Surge — follows renewed scrutiny of a state fraud investigation involving a number of individuals of Somali descent, a link that community leaders say has fueled fear beyond those accused.

The heightened enforcement has coincided with clashes between teachers, parents and federal law enforcement officers.

On Wednesday, a parent was detained by ICE at a school bus stop in Robbinsdale, a Minneapolis suburb, according to a statement from Robbinsdale Area Schools Superintendent Teri Staloch. And last week, on the day Good was killed, U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with teachers and protesters at the nearby Roosevelt High School. At least one educator was detained and released, according to the teachers union.

In response to the disruptions, the Minneapolis Public School District said last week it would offer online classes to its roughly 30,000 students until Feb. 12. St. Paul Public Schools, which serves more than 30,000 students, said Thursday it would offer a similar online option and will close school several days next week to prepare.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,” and that “criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

“Our officers are highly trained and in the face of rioting, doxxing, and physical attacks, they have shown professionalism,” she added. “They are not afraid of loud noises and whistles.”

Bearing witness

Kearns, 56, said the heightened enforcement has been visible beyond the schools where organized patrols first appeared. On Friday afternoon, he drove around Riverview Elementary School on Minneapolis’ west side — which has a large Latino population — watching sites he said have become flashpoints in recent weeks.

“We have basically a Gestapo coming in and infiltrating our neighborhood and just doing whatever they feel like they want to do,” he said.

The sightings pushed Kearns to begin patrolling the area around his former school.

“I grew up, born and raised here, went to this school, played football here, kissed my wife when I was a little boy,” he said, pointing to a field on the school’s property. “We protect our kids in our community. I mean, that’s what every other community would do in this situation or any situation.”

As NBC News spoke with Kearns, a handful of volunteers — most of them parents — watched nearby. Several appeared visibly shaken, declining to discuss how the patrols were organized or how volunteers communicate, citing safety concerns about publicizing their plans. St. Paul Public Schools expressed gratitude for the “care and concern” from the community but noted the patrols are being organized independently. The Minneapolis Public School District did not immediately return a request for comment.

The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement. In recent months, volunteers in cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have deployed similar patrols.

Leah Hood, 42, an instructor at a nearby university, said she started patrolling Green Central Elementary School this week after hearing from her friends who were already volunteering. She said the presence of observers feels crucial in a moment when families fear encounters could happen without witnesses.

“I mean, how horrifying that you would be kidnapped off the street while coming and going from school at all?” she asked. “But how much more horrifying and terrifying is it to think that that could happen and no one would see it, and no one would be able to attest to the fact that this is real, and they did this to you?”

Hood pointed to directives from state and local officials in recent days. Prosecutors have asked the public to submit videos related to Good’s killing, as much of the evidence gathered by the FBI remains inaccessible to local authorities. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week encouraged Minnesotans to “peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct their activities.”

Kids scared and confused

Parents and teachers who spoke with NBC News said children have been fearful and confused amid the heightened enforcement.

Desiree, who has patrolled Green Central Elementary School for weeks and asked that her last name not be published due to safety concerns, said her son has repeatedly asked about law enforcement sightings nearby.

“It’s not a mystery to them that something terrible is happening and that it’s happening right around them,” she said.

Greg said the community, shaped by past trauma over George Floyd’s killing, has responded with solidarity.

“You get on this corner and all day long it’s just cars passing by, and everyone’s waving and saying ‘thank you’ because we’re all looking out for each other,” he said.

Dirkswager, 38, said the events last week compelled him to patrol Bancroft Elementary School in the Central neighborhood of Minneapolis, blocks away from where Floyd was murdered in 2020.

“The events last week pushed me to the point where I had to get outside and do something — even if it’s just standing on a corner and blowing my silly little whistle at federal agents that are driving by,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260116-minneapolis-Joe-Dirkswager-mn-2237-66403f.jpg",N,,2026-01-17 19:57:59.151012

Last week, a man previously arrested by ICE outside the Portsmouth Police Department was due in Newport Superior Court but did not show up.

Advocates say ICE agents were outside court on that day as well.

The arrest was caught on surveillance cameras outside the station and released to the public from Portsmouth police.

A warrant for the arrest of 29-year-old Josue Perez Gomez was later issued.

Across the country, some immigrants have been skipping their court hearings out of fear that ICE agents will arrest and detain them.

""I've had some that don't want to pursue claims because they would have to show up at court,"" Dennis said when asked if he has clients who are concerned about showing up to court out of fear of ICE agents.

Advocates are asking the Rhode Island court system to allow people to hold their hearings virtually so that they don’t have to worry about showing up at court and finding ICE there to detain them.

Some Rhode Island Republicans are staunchly against the idea of virtual court hearings.

""For me that would feel a bit obstructionist for the judiciary to do that,"" Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz said.

""It's not just bad policy. It's deliberate. It's dangerous. And it's a calculated attempt to shield criminal illegal aliens from deportation,"" Anthony d'Ellena said.

""These people have nothing to fear if they're here legally,"" he said when asked about ICE agents detaining immigrants with legal status. ""If you're here illegally, you deserve to be deported. You broke the law coming into this country and you need to leave.""

The discussion around state immigration policy comes as there are renewed concerns about federal funding being withheld from Rhode Island.

In August, the Department of Justice released a memo threatening to cut off federal funding from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" who they ""identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Rhode Island is on the list.

""I certainly don't think that the administration would look at the judiciary here in Rhode Island and say, oh, well, that's okay. They would look at it just the same as the cities and towns who count themselves as sanctuary cities,"" de la Cruz said. ""It's like you know, don't play cute games. The administration has said if you try to obstruct us we will halt funding and if we don't want funding halted to our state then we need to comply with federal law.""

""Rhode Island refuses to follow federal law and should not receive a dime federal funding if we do not comply,"" D'Ellena said, adding, ""President Trump's Feb. 1st cut off on funding to sanctuary states is exactly what we need"" to compel the Rhode Island state legislature to adjust the state's sanctuary city policies.

Anti-ICE protesters force back small group of far-right activists

No injuries reported, but influencer says vest blocked stabbing attempt

Thousands of ICE agents deployed to Minneapolis

MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.

Waving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters did not observe any serious violence.

ONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ATTEMPT

Jake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.

Later, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.

Minneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.

Camera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but those individuals left before officers could contact them.

The anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.

""We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,"" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. ""I'm here to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to leave their house.""

Lang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.

Some 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.

The situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

In the case of Good, ICE has maintained the narrative that they were acting in self-defense, even though they had surrounded her vehicle and threatened her before she attempted to drive away.

As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.","The suddenness, scale and violence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids over the last year have prompted neighborhoods and volunteers to either record raids in progress or preemptively stand guard near areas where raids might take place, such as schools with immigrant children. This accountability led to the numerous videos that captured the moment when ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week, sparking a nationwide outpouring of anger and grief.

Good had been monitoring an elementary school as students were being dropped off before Ross stepped in front of her vehicle and shot her. Human and civil rights advocates who spoke to Salon have called this a classic example of law enforcement foisting on their victim a “deadly dilemma,” forcing the person to appear as aggressive or insubordinate and giving agents an excuse to react violently.

Before Good’s death, other civilians across the country who were recording or watching ICE had been threatened, physically assaulted and arrested, amplifying the sense among critics that ICE officers, the broader law enforcement establishment and the Trump administration view themselves as above the law and capable of getting away with it.

Nevertheless, critics say that ICE, Customs and Border Protection and other institutions have followed a similar playbook used by police states, maintaining the thinnest pretexts to justify their behavior in a way that gives, in theory, plausible deniability, and signals to critics that they’re too powerful to need a perfect alibi.

“They typically cite these vague concepts of obstruction, interference with an investigation, incitement in protest cases, entirely inapplicable statutes, presumably to sound official,” Seth Stern, advocacy director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Salon. “Let’s say somebody is following an ICE vehicle to record what the officers are doing, which does not actually fall under a stalking statute, to state the obvious. It is not stalking to follow a law enforcement officer to document what they’re up to — that’s constitutionally protected conduct. But more often than not, ICE officials on the ground, and higher-ups alike, will cite those loose concepts to intimidate and later justify their actions on social media or unofficial statements.”

“If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

Federal court rulings have reaffirmed the right of citizens to observe and record police activity in public areas under the First Amendment. Civilians with little knowledge of statutes and court rulings or experience in dealing with law enforcement have proven, in many documented cases, to be fairly resilient against those kinds of tactics. But generally, they still operate with fewer defenses than professional journalists, and might, due to uncertainty over repercussions, put away their camera or delete their footage when confronted by an armed officer.

Organizations like Carolina Migrant Network and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) have been working to not only educate people about their rights when filming or watching ICE agents, but train them on how to effectively document the evidence while avoiding personal injury and unlawful arrest.

In one video, LULAC advises recorders to keep their camera focused on agents rather than their victims, verbally narrate the facts, strategically capture key information like badges and street signs, and potentially limited themselves to note-taking and other support roles while someone less at risk handles the recording. While some people might find themselves as unexpected witnesses of an ICE raid, other volunteers, such as those working with the Carolina Migrant Network, have formed or joined rapid-response text groups to coordinate movement and to be able to arrive on-site soon after an alert goes out.

“What happened in Minneapolis could have happened here in Charlotte, could have happened in Chicago, could have happened anywhere. It wasn’t shocking to folks who have been doing the work for a long time, because they’ve witnessed firsthand what ICE is capable of doing,” Stefania Arteaga, co-founder and co-director of the Carolina Migrant Network, told Salon. “If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

The widespread protests over Good’s death are an example of just how far people have been pushed, but Arteaga expressed her wish that such outrage could be found earlier.

“There was a prevailing attitude that everything was good and dandy again until we found ourselves once again under a Trump administration where we’re being forced to confront the history of the United States and their treatment of immigrants and other minority groups,” she said. “More than before, white America is reckoning with the fact that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t start under Trump. But the fact that it took this long really shows the lack of humanity that is given to immigrants, immigrant voices, immigrant stories and immigrant life.”

During the Obama and Biden administrations and the first Trump administration, ICE used family separation, raids and physical and verbal aggression against immigrants, but were more prone to brush off witnesses as mere annoyances. The second Trump administration has overseen a marked increase in permissibility for particularly brazen actions, with the Department of Homeland Security making it official policy to prosecute those who videotape ICE agents and post the content on social media. While federal courts have usually ruled against newer or intensified ICE policy as unconstitutional or in violation of existing statutes, ICE has found ways to continue forcefully handling any perceived threats to their mission.

In the case of Good, ICE has maintained the narrative that they were acting in self-defense, even though they had surrounded her vehicle and threatened her before she attempted to drive away. The tactics ICE used against Good are recognizable across the country against people who may have narrowly avoided her fate. Sometimes, agents would issue contradictory orders which would force someone to risk serious danger either way; other times, they might trap cars, snatch people’s phones, and otherwise escalate the intensity of a confrontation, hoping, critics say, to make their victim panic.

“I had a scenario where an agent called the police on me. They are intentionally trying to frame the situation in ways that are completely disingenuous,” Arteaga recalled.

Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country have passed bills designed to codify limitations on the ability of civilians to hold ICE and law enforcement accountable. One popular proposal has been to ban recording police activity within a certain distance — usually around 25 feet. Those laws, which go far beyond punishing actual obstruction and interference, have largely been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.

“Law enforcement agencies are all public institutions, and allowing the wider public to see what they’re doing and potentially object to what they’re doing and recognize that what they’re doing is wrong is not legally actionable interference,” Stern said. “That’s the purpose of good journalism, to expose wrongdoing and alert the public that their officials are not behaving as they should.”

“To the extent that officers consider journalism in and of itself to be obstruction,” he continued, “those are probably officers who should be obstructed.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/ice-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-GettyImages-2255783416.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:08.166633

This year threatens to be the one that makes or breaks the unique moral commitment to human rights that has underpinned, even when flawed, the global order for the past 80 years.

Instead, the message sent around the world by bombastic leaders, acted out by mobs, armies and militias and embedded into the technology that shapes daily life, is that some people are less than human, deserve less empathy, compassion, opportunity or even physical safety.

This is potentially even more dangerous than the implosion of the “international rules-based order”. It normalises heinous behaviour towards other human beings in a world that has never had greater capacity for self-destruction.

You hear it everywhere. The tone is set when the US President declares some people are scum or a Cameroonian “freedom fighter” succinctly says his opponents, “don’t see us as human. Likewise we don’t see them as [human]”.

Australia, thanks to the work of Labor party leader Doc Evatt, was one of the midwives of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But Australia remains the only liberal democracy not to have adopted its own constitutional or statutory bill of rights. Instead there is a patchwork of local laws and international agreements.

For all the talk about Australian values this absence is a telling reminder of the fragility of our rights as citizens and human beings.

This has come into sharp focus in the debate after the Bondi attack, and the implosion of the Adelaide writers’ week.

In the rush to blame, the principle is lost. When the threat feels existential, pluralism is attacked and tolerance as a virtue derided.

The Australian commitment to human rights is always subject to political whim. Legislation protecting rights has been voided to allow racially charged laws to pass, including the Northern Territory intervention. States that have legislated to recognise rights, readily vacate the legislation to remove them from some groups – most frequently First Nations people.

After years of work, legislation asserting the rights of artists – something that had been promised in the last South Australian election campaign – was introduced in 2025. But the parliament ran out of time to pass it. Among the principles outlined in the bill was that “all artists, makers and creatives in South Australia have the right to freedom of artistic and creative expression.” If this had been enacted, would it have changed the ground rules, and meant the conundrum played out differently?

Last year, in recognition of the increasing fragility of the international commitment to human rights, the government appointed former attorney general and sitting MP Mark Dreyfus as an International Human Rights envoy.

It would be good if he started his advocacy at home.

Given that the consensus is that Australian constitutional change is just too hard, a statutory bill of rights could have symbolic as well as practical impact. It would also strengthen Australian advocacy in a world where human rights are increasingly derided.

This is not just a legal debate: human rights and empathy touch everything.

In the tick-box world mediated by AI, it is likely to become even more pervasive. We know that the selection biases of technology are increasingly excluding people, ensuring that the world order as it exists in the minds of technocrats is imposed on us all. They generally don’t do empathy or pay attention to people not like them.

Much of the time we can work around this, but sometimes it is accentuated.

Over the summer break I had two experiences that threw this into stark relief. Not the grand infringements of human rights that capture the headlines, but mundane encounters that point to the banal cruelty of a data-driven world in which empathy has evaporated and shades of grey no longer exist.

In response to one of those slightly threatening Robodebt-inflected Centrelink letters I waited until I had the time to sit on a call – last time it took three hours – and was pleasantly surprised that after 38 minutes a human answered.

I provided the required case number and then said, “But the person has died.”

The operator proceeded, “Can you spell his name again … and the birth date … the reference number.” I did this, and then added, “I know you are working to a script, but when someone tells you the client has died, it would be appropriate to pass on your condolences.”

“Oh yes,” he replied, “You are right. I am working to a script, we don’t have that option.”

“Well in the interests of training and quality control I hope this call is recorded and that is fixed,” I said.

“I’m sorry,” the operator replied, and without missing a beat we continued to populate the form with the details the script required.

A few weeks earlier a brilliant young colleague, educated to the highest level in the Stem disciplines, said with unnerving clarity when discussing whether to appeal a questionable driving fine: “I don’t like to rely on human intervention.”

If we give up on human intervention, the technocrats have won. There will be even less room for human rights in the world they are crafting in the name of efficiency and profit, under a cover of bombastic rhetoric. It’s not a fight we can afford to lose.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e848919432d279e7f9dc018c50d5274afb17b49/0_0_3804_3044/master/3804.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7063f166142a8219f493d8d1ad6460c4",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:12.441872

As protests escalated following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the Trump administration defended the agent and doubled down on its efforts in the Minneapolis area, sending in more resources.

Trump has also threatened to the extreme step of invoking the Insurrection Act to clamp down on the protests and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested people may be asked to “validate their identity” in some cases.

Here are some of the most common questions, answered.

What is the Insurrection Act?

The law that Trump is threatening to invoke would allow him to deploy active-duty US troops to Minnesota as “necessary to enforce (US) laws or to suppress the rebellion.”

The law says the president can send troops to control situations they consider to be “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.”

A state governor or legislature can also request troops — as was the case the last time the law was invoked in 1992 — but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has openly rebuked the surge of federal activity in Minneapolis.

There is precedent of a president invoking the act without the support of a governor.

Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy both invoked the Insurrection Act against the wishes of governors in order to facilitate school integration after the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.

On Friday, Trump said there’s no reason to use the Insurrection Act “right now,” but that he’d invoke the law if he felt it were necessary.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it. It’s very powerful,” the president told reporters.

Read CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf’s analysis of the Insurrection Act here.

What authority has the Trump administration given to federal agents?

Immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, according to a DHS policy. Historically, federal law enforcement agencies have spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.

But Trump administration officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents after high-profile use of force, raising questions about whether mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been abandoned in Trump’s second term, writes CNN’s Josh Campbell.

The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely, Campbell writes, due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI.

In August, during the federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police department, Trump effectively gave law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances, according to Campbell.

While lamenting images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers, Trump said in August, “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,” Trump said. “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”

“But now,” he added, “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”

A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN.

Read more of Campbell’s analysis on federal agents’ powers here.

Can federal agents ask to see proof of citizenship?

Noem said Thursday that federal agents may also ask people around someone they’re targeting to “validate their identity.”

“If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they’re there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “That’s what we’ve always done.”

Is this legal? CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig said, “It’s illegal and it’s unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop.”

“What you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‘Hey, you need to prove to us that you’re a US citizen,’” Honig added. “The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.”

Cori Alonso-Yoder, an associate professor at University of Maryland law school, told CNN federal agents can ask for proof of citizenship, but people can resist showing their documents under the Fifth Amendment.

“ICE certainly can ask and then the question is, then, how does an individual in that circumstance respond,” Yoder, who is also the director of the law school’s immigration clinic, said. “Because there are protections under the Fifth Amendment, regardless of immigration status, to not incriminate oneself or to again assert one’s right to remain silent when engaging with law enforcement.”

What is the 10th Amendment, which Minnesota has invoked to block federal agents?

On Monday, Minnesota filed a lawsuit seeking to curb the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown in the state, arguing that it violates the 10th Amendment.

Illinois has also filed a similar lawsuit.

Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University, told CNN the 10th Amendment established that states retain sovereign power to make local laws and govern within their borders, and the federal government cannot impose its will over a state, unless that authority has been granted by Congress or the Constitution.

In its lawsuit, Minnesota emphasized strains on local police resources, asserting that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said earlier this week that the state’s lawsuit is aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2255776689.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:40.243693

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.

The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.

ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”

The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.

The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference last year.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 18:58:10.364417

Welcome to Martin Luther King weekend! Let us ground ourselves in the wisdom, courage and examples – past and present – of nonviolent and life-affirming movements for justice and peace. It will be nourishment for our spirits to be together at one or more of the many MLK community celebrations throughout the state. Here’s a good list (NHPR), and scroll down to the Events section for some highlights. We thank our friend Arnie Alpert for sharing the story with the NH Center for Justice & Equity of how NH people organized over decades (!) to establish this important holiday.

Read more about the statewide MLK Coalition’s celebration on Monday, January 19 in Manchester, where former NH Senator Melanie Levesque will receive the Martin Luther King award for her tireless leadership for voting rights, public education, and racial justice (read more here). NH Representative Alice Wade, a courageous champion for the rights of transgender people and civil rights for all, will receive the Vanessa Johnson Youth Award.

We were sad to learn last week of the passing of Claudette Colvin at the age of 86. At 15 years old, and already a student of active nonviolence, Claudette refused to give up her seat on the bus, nine months before Rosa Parks’ act of dignified defiance would launch the Montgomery bus boycott. “I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the other – saying. ‘Sit down girl!’ I was glued to my seat.” Read more about Claudette here. We at AFSC-NH have fond memories of welcoming Claudette to NH for our annual celebration back in 2009.

Strong opposition to death penalty bills

While last week’s public hearings on death penalty bills began in a chaotic fashion – due to an overscheduled daily calendar in the House Criminal Justice Committee, and outrageous speeches by bill sponsors – the messages delivered by members of the public to lawmakers were sacred testimonies of compassion, courage, and love. The most powerful voices were those of the family members of murder victims and other victims of violence – including the sisters and daughter of the late and beloved Renny Cushing, New England Yearly Meeting secretary Noah Merrill, NH Council of Churches executive director Lisa Beaudoin, and many others. Committee members also heard from Paul Hildwin, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent three decades on death row in Florida. Hear some of his story here (WMUR).

In addition, compelling testimony was provided about the extraordinary financial cost and complexity of the infrastructure and procedures for capital punishment, and the lack of deterrent effects. No one except bill sponsors spoke in favor of the bills.

You can listen to the hearings here: January 14 (starting at 5:48:30), and January 15. And you’ll find news coverage at NHPR and InDepthNH. We also want to lift up an op-ed from our NH Program Associate, Ophelia Burnett: “The death penalty is inhumane - the ultimate form of slavery.”

In related news, the NH Attorney General argued last week that the death penalty sentence in Michael Addison’s murder conviction is “not excessive, nor disproportionate.” Read more here. Michael Addison, an African-American man convicted in the 2006 shooting death of police officer Michael Briggs, is still on death row in NH despite the 2019 repeal.

ICE activity expands in NH

Approximately 45 people gathered at the Strafford County jail in Dover on Friday in a vigil of solidarity with the family of Oscar Gutierrez Cardona, an immigrant who is being sent to Honduras this week, a place he fled many years ago in order to save his life. Oscar’s deportation leaves his wife and children without a beloved husband and father, and leaves the Manchester community he called home to mourn his absence and the injustice of his removal. Read more here and here. We are heartbroken, angry, and committed to continuing our resistance to the cruelty and violence of detention and deportation.

We’re frustrated to report that another NH town – Auburn – has signed a 287g agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), enabling more law enforcement collusion with the violent and often lawless actions of ICE. Auburn’s decision brings the number of NH law enforcement agencies with 287g agreements to 13, and to 14 in all of New England, a shameful tally. Read more here, and learn more about the efforts of our indefatigable colleagues at ACLU-NH to obtain the training materials 287g participants. New Hampshire people have a right to know how our locally funded law enforcement agencies will be ‘prepared’ to participate in the federal government’s mass deportation machine.

And one more bit of grim news on the immigration front – it appears that a site may have been secured for the rumored ICE “processing center” planned for Merrimack, NH, although local officials are still unwilling to confirm the news. Read more here. As many who testified last week in support of HB 1609, a commonsense bill that would prohibit the use of state or local funds for immigration detention, explained, there’s no good reason for local or state dollars to support a massively over-funded federal operation, especially in a state facing a “grim” budget picture. Read more here. Not to mention the moral arguments against our participation.

Here are the action alerts we’ve received from partners for this coming week.

Today – Protect transgender rights.

OPPOSE SB 268, permitting classification of individuals based on biological sex under certain limited circumstances. This bill was a retained bill from 2025. The House passed it on January 8, and now it heads to Governor Ayotte. This bill is nearly identical to the so-called “bathroom bill” she vetoed last spring. Please call the governor and urge her to VETO it (603-271-2121).

Tuesday, January 20 – Protect immigrant tenants, and all tenants

OPPOSE HB 1499, relative to additional grounds for eviction under the landlord and tenant statute. This anti-immigrant bill adds new grounds for termination of tenancy based on a tenant’s immigration status, and certain criminal convictions. Here is an explainer of key points. This bill has a public hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 20 at 10 AM in GP, Room 231. This is a priority bill; please sign in to oppose, and show up to share testimony. And please share this flyer with your networks.

OPPOSE HB 1598, relative to notice for tenants and landlords engaged in eviction processes. This dangerous bill would lead to a dramatic erosion of tenant rights and increase in evictions. You can share these two flyers – here and here – to inform and mobilize your networks. Here is an explainer of key points. This bill has a public hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 20 at 11 AM in GP, Room 231. This is a priority bill; please sign in to oppose, and show up to share testimony.

Friday, January 23 - Protect Death Penalty Repeal!

Due to a scheduling mess in the House Criminal Justice Committee last week, three of the death penalty bills have new hearing dates next week. This means we have more time to sign in to oppose these bills, contact the committee, and share testimony. Here are the details for how to take action: Show up in person to sign-in in opposition and submit your written testimony, or sign-in remotely, no later than midnight on January 23, to OPPOSE the three bills – HB 1749, reinstating the death penalty for murder offenses; HB 1413, reinstituting the death penalty in cases of capital murder; and HB 1737, relative to reinstating the death penalty for certain offenses against minors under 13 years of age.

“A House of Dynamite” film discussion – 7 PM, on Zoom. Hosted by NH Peace Action and Back from the Brink. The current administration's plans to renew nuclear weapons testing is one alarming reminder that the threat of nuclear war is still a very real concern. “A House of Dynamite” is an apocalyptic political thriller that gives us a view of the devastating anticipation of a nuclear attack. Get drawn into the nerve-wracking decision rooms as this unsettling picture shows us what could become our future if the right choices are not made today. Watch the film (on Netflix) and then join us on zoom for a discussion about this film and what actions we can take now. Jeremy Love of Back from the Brink will lead the discussion to help us find a sense of purpose instead of hopelessness. Before watching the movie, we recommend you take a look at Back from the Brink's Beginner's Guide to Nuclear Weapons. Accessing the film: If you are not able to access this movie on your own, but would like to be a part of this discussion, let us know (info@nhpeaceaction.org). If there are enough people who need access to the movie, we will attempt to connect people to watch the movie together. As you watch the movie, think about how you feel about the threat of nuclear war, what you think is realistic considering the actions of current world leaders, and how you feel life would change after a nuclear attack.

""I never did like bullies, and that's what the federal government has become,"" Brown said, explaining why an octogenarian stood outside for four hours in -2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill (-19 Celsius). ""What's happening in my city is nothing more than authoritarian intimidation, and me and my neighbors are not going to put up with it.""

PARENTS PATROL SCHOOLS

The Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 federal agents across the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, making it the latest region targeted by the president's mass deportation program. People who normally might be organizing parent-teacher association meetings are arranging security patrols at their kids' schools to watch for immigration agents.

Some parents not on patrol are escorting foreign-born teachers or staff members, driving them to and from their homes and schools to make them feel safer. Others are delivering groceries and prescription medicines to immigrant families who are too afraid to leave their homes or send their kids to class.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat representing Minnesota, said on Friday she had met with school principals from her state ""and heard horror stories of kids and parents 'under siege' by ICE.""

""Little kids scared. Dangerous encounters. This is no longer about a fraud investigation,"" Klobuchar wrote on social media, as she urged residents to remain peaceful.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said this week more than 2,500 people have been arrested during the effort that officials have dubbed Operation Metro Surge. DHS has repeatedly said its agents are not targeting schools.

“ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. ""Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""

But parents and school leaders say otherwise.

A spokesperson for Saint Paul Public Schools said in a statement that two of its contracted student transportation vans were pulled over by ICE agents this week. Several schools and daycare centers have emailed parents to notify them of teachers and staff who have been detained, according to school leaders and parents.

SOME STUDENTS LEARNING ONLINE

Schools have notified the public that some parents have been detained at bus stops after dropping off kids. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters on the grounds of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis as classes ended, just a few hours after Good was shot and killed. DHS said the clash followed agents' pursuit of someone who had rammed one of their vehicles several miles away and fled to the school grounds.

Several school districts — including those in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the state's two largest — have cancelled classes some days and are allowing students to learn online instead of attending classes in person for the next several weeks in response to the immigration operations.

“Many families in my area are afraid to send their kids to school because ICE is staking out our bus stops,” state Representative Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, a Democrat and co-chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives' Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee, told the Star Tribune newspaper.

Nate Byrne, a spokesperson for Kids Count on Us, a coalition of 500 community-based childcare centers in Minnesota, said it is receiving daily reports about ICE officers on or near childcare center grounds, and that such centers in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods have seen a 50% reduction in attendance.

Kids Count on Us has received reports of childcare workers taken into ICE custody, Byrne said, though he did not have specific figures.

PARENTS DELIVER FOOD, RAISE MONEY

""Parents who are not fearful of being detained by ICE — typically because they are white — are forming teams to patrol outside their childcare centers during drop-off and pick-up and when staff need to come and go,"" Byrne said. ""Parents who are fearful of being detained by ICE due to the color of their skin are being extremely cautious.""

St. Paul parent Kelly, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, citing fears of retribution from the federal government, said she was helping deliver food to immigrant families that attend her children's school but were afraid to leave their homes. Parents are also raising money to help pay rent for the families across the metro area, as the parents are missing work, according to Kelly and other parents.

Kelly, who was attending a Friday night protest against ICE with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 9, said she was bewildered by what has become of her city amid the immigration raids. In years past, she volunteered for parent-teacher association events. Now, she carries a whistle everywhere she goes and said she is ready to confront federal agents if they approach her kids' school.

""There's no parenting handbook for this,"" Kelly said. ""My parents never had to sit me down and explain that my classmates who are suddenly missing from school aren't there because their parents are afraid of being snatched by the government.""

Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.","The phones at Sunnyside High School were ringing with calls from concerned parents on Thursday afternoon, as false reports of immigration agents on campus spread on social media, school officials said.

In fact, Sunnyside High and Los Amigos Elementary went into a precautionary ""soft lockdown"" Thursday — with the perimeter gates locked, but classes still in session — due to a nearby law enforcement operation on Tucson's south side.

Immigration agents were never on campus, and students were not at risk, said Marisela Felix, school district spokesperson.

The incident was one of several incorrect social-media reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Tucson in recent weeks.

Amid the federal government's violent crackdown in Minneapolis, and reports of an impending escalation of ICE enforcement in Phoenix, anxiety is surging among Tucson's immigrant and advocacy communities, advocates say.

Some false rumors have circulated online, and there's been an increase in reports of ICE sightings — some valid, some false alarms — to the local ""Rapid Response"" network, which sends trained observers to bear witness to potential ICE arrests.

Local advocates say they're working to balance the need for an urgent response to good-faith reports of ICE activity, with making efforts to verify initial reports when possible.

It's hard to say if there's been a true surge in ICE activity here this month, or if heightened awareness is leading to more reports, some volunteers say. But likely it's both, said Sarah Roberts, an immigrant-rights advocate and volunteer with Tucson's Coalición de Derechos Humanos, or Human Rights Coalition.

ICE is definitely active in Tucson, Roberts said, noting the hotline got a call Tuesday from a woman who said her husband had just been arrested by ICE and was seeking legal help.

Photos shared Friday by a Facebook user show three agents, wearing green vests that say, ""POLICE/ICE,"" at the Tucson Spectrum shopping center on West Irvington Road.

The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said. ""That's a good thing.""

Immigration agents carry out arrests quickly and are often gone before observers with Rapid Response can arrive; advocates don't want community members to hesitate to report possible ICE activity for fear of making an incorrect report.

""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.

Still, there's a real risk of burnout for activists and members of the immigrant community, who are often in a sustained state of hyper-vigilance, Roberts said. There's also a risk of ""secondary trauma"" from witnessing enforcement actions, she said.

Sunnyside officials are encouraging members of the public to be prudent about what they share online, as unverified rumors can cause unnecessary stress and confusion.

""False rumors have been circulating on social media claiming that 'ICE was at Sunnyside High School.' This is not true,"" Felix said in a Thursday email. ""We ask parents and our community to be part of the solution, and to be aware of the serious consequences of resharing information on social media that is not reliable and from a verified source.""

Local officials have been trying to prepare the public for a possible deployment of National Guard or other federal authorities to the area, though no such deployment has been announced.

ICE's media team has not responded to the Arizona Daily Star’s query about whether more ICE agents will soon be sent to Phoenix or Tucson.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero directed city staff to create a website to help members of the public know their rights and prepare for potential encounters with federal agents.

Pima County Attorney Laura Conover urged Tucson residents to stay calm during interactions with federal agents and during protest activity.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness,"" Conover said in a written statement Monday. ""And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water. ... We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive.""

Operation on the south side

The law-enforcement operation near Sunnyside Thursday was led by the U.S. Marshals Service, part of the Arizona ""Wanted"" Task Force that targets violent offenders, U.S. Deputy Marshal Mindy Miller told the Star. The task force comprises local, state and federal agencies.

Border Patrol agents were present at the scene, near the intersection of South Campbell Avenue and Drexel, Miller said.

The Jan. 15 operation targeted Jorge Cardenas-Valencia, who is in the U.S. illegally and was wanted in Pima County on multiple criminal counts: transport of narcotic drugs for sale, misconduct involving weapons in the commission of a drug offense, use of wire communication in the commission of a drug offense, conspiracy, illegally conducting an enterprise and misconduct involving weapons of a prohibited possessor, Miller said in an email.

Maria Carrasco, a leader in Derechos Humanos and Rapid Response, was among those who responded to the scene of the south-side operation before details were known.

Rapid Response has been receiving dozens of calls each day, and Carrasco said she's trying to personally respond to as many reports as she can.

""We are all stressed like crazy. There's 10 of us answering the phone. I had more than 20 calls on my phone today,"" she said Thursday.

Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.

A recent training session for new volunteers was ""a full house,"" Carrasco said. That's good news, she said, because current volunteers are stretched thin.

""We have to be careful because we’re going to get burned out,"" she said. ""I'm very proud the community is coming together with one voice to protect our families and our community. ... I'm very hopeful that we’re going to change this government to the right side.""

Since the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Good by an ICE agent, some advocates are newly fearing for their own lives and safety, said Lucia Vindiola, a volunteer with the Coalición de Derechos Humanos.

""There is that concern: If I continue, am I going to die? How far are Trump and ICE and immigration (authorities) going to go with all of this?"" said Vindiola, a seventh-generation Tucsonan, who said her family lived here before Arizona was part of the United States.

ICE's actions, such as wearing face masks, undermine trust in law enforcement broadly, harming public safety by discouraging people from reporting crime, advocates say.

""They don't know who to trust,"" Vindiola said. ""ICE covers up their faces like criminals. Why is that happening? Why are they not behaving like law enforcement agents, with their name tags and actual badges?""

Vindiola leads the emotional-support committee within Derechos Humanos, which holds art therapy sessions for kids and adolescents and offers therapy for adults.

The group is organizing a series of ""healing circle"" events, starting this weekend. The event — invite-only, for now — aims to help volunteers cope with the pressures they're facing, and find ways to manage stress in a sustainable way, she said.

""We are stressing out so much, and we need to be able to have a way to heal our own psyche, to heal our own energy,"" she said. ""We're trying to take care of our emotional health, as well.""

Police in St. Cloud are increasing staffing after a video surfaced showing an ICE agent hitting a man with a baton.

Chase Benjamin, the man in the video, said he was detained after the incident. Benjamin described the situation, saying, “The video shows it all, I’m just walking, trying to get through the crowd and just start getting attacked.”

Benjamin explained he was running errands at the Star City Mall in St. Cloud when clashes occurred between hundreds of people and ICE agents. He said he was attacked and then taken to the Whipple Federal Building in the Twin Cities, where he waited for 8 hours before being released later that night.

“At this point, I’m being kidnapped,” Benjamin said.

St. Cloud City Councilmember Karen Larson was present during the incident to encourage peace. “Tensions are high on both sides right now, and we need to calm ourselves,” Larson said.

She expressed concern about the potential for violence, stating, “We could have had another violent incident.”

ICE officials informed St. Cloud city staff that their operations are “ongoing” but did not provide specifics. Larson emphasized the importance of safety for those who feel targeted and supports both First Amendment rights and lawful law enforcement duties.

“There’s a third path where we can sit down in the middle and talk about the mess that we are all in to try and solve it,” she said.

Benjamin, an American citizen, is considering legal action following the incident. He had this message to the community, saying, “To the people, just protect your community, stand up for yourself. You’ve got the right to.”

Another letter argues that recent actions regarding immigration, law enforcement, and climate policy are unconstitutional and un-American.

A third writer claims current immigration enforcement is not about reform but about promoting division and hatred.

Here are this week’s letters to the editor of the Herald Times Reporter. See our letters policy below for details about how to share your views.

Who will take away his ‘License to Kill’?

Let’s examine “License to Kill” lyrics by Bob Dylan from his 1983 album “Infidels” in light of current U.S. leadership and recent events.

“Well, the judge, he holds a six-gun, / And the gospel he delivers / Is one that you can hear / In any saloon or alley”

This verse suggests justice is perverted and the law is enforced with violence, comparing it to the Wild West or urban crime.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This highlights the role of interpreters or translators (possibly referring to U.S. advisers or diplomats) who understand the true law in these conflict zones is the law of the gun, not written laws or international agreements.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This reinforces the idea that the U.S. government’s actions are driven by a desire for power and control, rather than a genuine concern for democracy or human rights.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This suggests the U.S. government is complicit in the violence and suffering caused by its interventions, and that it is willing to sacrifice human lives for its geopolitical goals.

This is not OK

As I watch outrage after outrage in the daily news, and the attempts by many to justify and even normalize such things as much-needed change, I find myself in disbelief.

It is not OK for immigrants to be deported without having their day in court. Even if they have broken the law, it is explicitly stated in our Constitution that everyone has the right to a trial when accused of a crime, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Even the Jan. 6 rioters, who were filmed on TV committing crimes, were given trials before punishment.

It is not OK for a woman to be killed by an untrained paramilitary agent. Real law enforcement personnel are trained in de-escalation; lethal force is used only as a last resort. Whatever happened to shooting the tires to stop a vehicle? The tragedy in Minneapolis was an emotional, non-professional overreaction by an unaccountable militia. Definitely not OK.

It is not OK for the U.S. to pull out of the Paris climate accords. This was done, as usual, by presidential memorandum, without consultation with Congress. We are the only country in the world to leave this treaty. It is an embarrassing and foolish denial of basic climate science, driven by a single man who doesn’t like windmills.

I could go on — the list is long and profoundly un-American. Much of this is enabled by a weak Congress. Call your elected representatives to say what’s going on in this country is not OK.

This was never about immigration reform

The rationale for current immigration enforcement in the U.S. is often presented as an effort to reform a broken system and protect the public. However, the actions of authorities, especially ICE, reveal these stated motivations do not align with reality.

Enforcement is frequently justified as targeting the “worst of the worst,” yet ICE has detained preschool workers described as loving and trustworthy, and apprehending men seeking work at places like Home Depot, as well as hardworking farm laborers. These actions contradict claims that immigrants are draining welfare resources or refusing to work.

ICE has also targeted individuals attending legally mandated court proceedings, undermining the argument that enforcement is only about removing those unwilling to follow the law.

Deportation is not simply a return to home countries; it has resulted in community members being sent to brutal foreign prisons with due process.

Public safety is further called into question by incidents in which ICE endangered communities, such as recent shootings of three people in crowded streets. This $40 billion system of structural violence must end.

Transparency is lacking, with ICE officers operating unmasked and without proper identification. The Trump administration and its sycophants are accused of manipulating public perception to justify these actions, fostering a secretive and brutal police force. The underlying motivation appears to be promoting division and hatred toward immigrants.

Administrations have long failed to address illegal immigration meaningfully. The persistent harm caused by these policies demands action. I vow to fight for justice and humanity in the immigration system.

Far less visible is the rapidly expanding, nationwide network of jails and prisons where ICE and Border Patrol lock people up after they are arrested, and that is almost certainly by design. Four people died in federal immigration jails so far in 2026, and at least 32 people died in ICE jails over the course of 2025 as President Donald Trump ramped up his mass deportation campaign.

The number of people imprisoned by ICE increased by 75 percent to nearly 66,000 in 2025, and despite repeated claims by administration officials about targeting “the worst of the worst,” nearly 74 percent have no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration database.

Ghandehari told Truthout that ICE has long faced allegations of allowing abuse, medical neglect, inhumane conditions, and solitary confinement in its network of jails and prisons, which are used to incarcerate people facing deportation orders.

ICE’s carceral facilities are often run by for-profit prison companies or local sheriffs acting as contractors. While many detainees are held at remote facilities in Louisiana and Texas, far from families and legal support, Ghandehari said ICE is now operating nearly 200 jails nationwide after opening or reopening more than 130 facilities in 2025.

“What we have seen and are seeing in Minneapolis is enraging; it’s unacceptable, it’s out of control, but unfortunately it is unsurprising given that ICE is inherently a violent agency, and what we are now seeing in Minneapolis is really the manifestation of years of ICE being allowed to act with impunity,” Ghandehari told Truthout.

On January 15, the county medical examiner in El Paso, Texas, announced that the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old man held at a massive immigration detention center at El Paso’s Fort Bliss military base, was likely a homicide. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Campos was attempting to kill himself and violently resisted when officers intervened but provided no evidence to back up that claim.

The most recent deaths among those imprisoned by ICE also include 46-year-old Parady La from Cambodia, who was arrested and jailed by ICE on January 6 and died three days later after receiving “treatment for severe drug withdrawal at the Federal Detention Center” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to DHS. La was found unresponsive in his cell the next day and was later pronounced dead of brain and organ failure at a nearby hospital.

Withdrawal from certain drugs and alcohol can be fatal but is easily treatable with medical supervision and proper medications. In an attempt to revive La, DHS claims federal officers administered CPR and naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdoses, not withdrawal symptoms. The Bureau of Prisons maintains a protocol for safely supervising drug withdrawal in federal detention facilities.

Jonathan Feinberg, an attorney for La’s family, said nobody should die in custody from opiate withdrawal.

“We do not at this point know exactly what happened to Parady La, but the circumstances that have been reported are highly suspicious and concerning,” Feinberg wrote in an email to Truthout on Friday. “We intend to conduct a full investigation and pursue every legal remedy available to his family.”

A 2024 report by Physicians for Human Rights examined 52 deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021 and found that 95 percent were preventable or possibly preventable if appropriate medical care had been provided. Civil liberties and international human rights groups have sounded alarm bells about medical neglect and preventable deaths in ICE custody for over a decade.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time this story was published. However, the official statement on La’s death includes a list of mostly minor drug and alcohol violations and accuses the man of being a “career criminal,” reflecting a larger pattern of ICE smearing people who are harmed at the hands of its agents. After Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis while attempting to pull away from the scene in her vehicle on January 7, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem baselessly accused the mother and poet of being a “domestic terrorist.”

Other recent deaths in ICE custody include Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, who was detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California and died on January 6, and Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, who was detained at the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas and died on January 5, according to Detention Watch Network.

“You can imagine how bad the conditions have been getting,” Ghandehari said. “It’s not even a full two weeks into this new year, and we already have four deaths in ICE custody.”

ICE cannot place U.S. citizens in detention for extended periods of time, but multiple citizens have reportedly been arrested by ICE under Trump’s crackdown, including George Retes, a U.S. veteran who was wrongly detained by ICE in California for three days after a chaotic raid on a cannabis farm in August.

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, one of the largest tribal nations in the U.S., has accused ICE of illegally holding four members arrested during raids in Minneapolis, according to Axios.

From New Jersey to California to Minnesota, immigration officials have barred Democratic lawmakers from entering ICE jails to conduct unannounced inspections and check on incarcerated constituents. A federal judge recently struck down a policy requiring advance notice from lawmakers, but Noem instituted a new policy that blocked Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats from visiting the central ICE holding facility in the Twin Cities shortly after Good was killed.

“When we appropriate funds as members of Congress, we are expected by the public to do oversight because the public requires their money be used with transparency and accountability,” Omar told reporters on January 10. “And what happened today is ICE agents decided that we were no longer allowed to fulfill our constitutional duties.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) says he may be the only member of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to an ICE jail under the Trump administration. Khanna and a staff member visited ICE California City Detention Center on January 6, the largest ICE prison in California. Khanna made the visit after one of his constituents “was beaten, unlawfully detained, and held at this very facility before being deported,” according to a social media post.

Khanna said he was “deeply disturbed” by his visit to the ICE prison, which currently holds nearly 1,500 people. When he spoke to families in the parking lot, they described their loved ones being subjected to “inadequate food, visible mold, and water that tastes like metal.” A lack of medical care was the most alarming failure, Khanna said, with one detainee telling the congressman that he was urinating blood but still had not received medical care.

“For illnesses like the flu, medicine is rarely provided; at best, [an] ibuprofen is given, but more often detainees are told to buy basic medicine from the commissary at exaggerated, unaffordable prices,” Khanna said. “With reportedly only one doctor for hundreds of people, the neglect is structural.”

Congress faces a self-imposed January 30 deadline to pass legislation funding the government, which gives lawmakers a chance to rein in ICE by defunding the infrastructure that makes Trump’s brutal “immigration” crackdown possible, including the expanding network of ICE jails and prisons, according to Ghandehari. ICE’s budget is set to balloon by $170 billion under the megabill championed by Trump and passed by Republicans in July 2025, but some progressive Democrats are now pushing to defund the agency.

“They can’t do what they are doing without infrastructure that has been built up over decades,” Ghandehari told Truthout, explaining that the only way to stop the Trump administration’s violence is by starting to dismantle ICE’s infrastructure. ”That’s why it’s so important that Congress do the right things this week and start the process of cutting ICE off.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2224632175-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 16:57:42.806376

They’re workers.","Donald Trump rode to reelection with racist attacks on immigrants and refugees and promising mass deportations. The first year of his second term was filled with heartbreak, trauma, and fear as his administration escalated its assault on immigrant communities: separating families, occupying cities, targeting workers, and expanding deportations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using its bloated budget to recruit among Trump’s far right base. This comes amid ICE’s horrific killing of Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis, staunchly defended by the Trump administration.

At the same time, we’ve seen inspiring community resistance to ICE and Trump across the U.S. Rapid response networks have grown. Teacher unions are defending immigrant students and families. There is growing mass resistance to ICE from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis.

A year ago, Truthout spoke to several community and farmworker organizations about how they were preparing for the second Trump administration. We reached out to some of those participants again to reflect on the past year in a new roundtable interview. They discuss the anguish of the past year and the challenges immigrant communities have faced, as well as how organizers are proactively responding and what’s keeping people motivated and inspired.

Rossy Alfaro is a former dairy worker in Vermont and organizer with Migrant Justice, which organizes dairy farmworkers in Vermont and oversees the worker-driven Milk with Dignity campaign. María Carrasco is a longtime volunteer with Derechos Humanos, a grassroots organization supporting migrant rights in Tucson, Arizona, and she is closely involved with the group’s rapid response work. Jeannie Economos is the longtime pesticide safety and environmental health project coordinator for the Farmworker Association of Florida, which has organized farmworkers for over four decades.

Note: These interviews took place in December 2025 and were conducted separately and edited into a roundtable format afterward. Alfaro’s interview was done with interpretation provided by Migrant Justice.

Derek Seidman: A year ago, we discussed how you were approaching the new Trump administration. How has the past year been for your community and organizing efforts?

Jeannie Economos: It’s much worse than we expected. The tactics they’re using are very disturbing. Children are being ripped apart from their parents. It’s causing chaos and heartbreak and mental health issues. The community is traumatized. ICE is waiting for people at courthouses and even schools and is intimidating people by wearing masks and dragging people out of their cars. It’s terrible. This is unprecedented.

María Carrasco: We’ve seen so many things already. Bounty hunters are out there doing a lot of damage. Many racist people got jobs with ICE and they don’t respect human rights. Sometimes they’re really violent when they arrest people. Every day it’s becoming more dangerous, and this is barely the beginning, because ICE is receiving more money.

They’ve detained a lot of workers we know. Their families come to our meetings. It’s heartbreaking how the kids whose parents are in detention are suffering. We’re traumatizing them. I’m so worried about that.

So many people are missing in the system. We can’t find them. I try to calm down the families. They call me and they’re desperate. There are a lot of Venezuelans being taken. They’re being picked up and deported even though they’re refugees and have all their paperwork.

Rossy Alfaro: It’s had a huge impact on our community. The attacks have been so extreme. Even though we knew what was coming, you can’t really be prepared for it being so intense. So there’s a certain amount of panic in the farmworker community. People are feeling terrorized.

At the same time, people are really resolute, especially within our farmworker community here in Vermont. We fought hard for the protections that we’ve won, and we’re going to fight to retain them.

Can you discuss more what the administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants has meant for farmworker communities?

Economos: Things were difficult over a year ago with all the anti-immigrant sentiment and rhetoric, but that looks good compared to what we are seeing now, especially some of the tactics they’re using against the immigrant population. Before, farmworkers were afraid to file complaints for workplace violations, but now they’re afraid to go to work at all. Of course, some people still go to work, but they’re taking a risk. Some farmers have planted fewer crops because they are worried they won’t find enough workers to harvest. It’s causing chaos in agriculture.

Many employers in Florida are implementing E-Verify, a system which tracks immigration status, which means a lot of people won’t get jobs. So they end up in the underground economy working for unscrupulous employers who exploit them and commit wage theft because they’re undocumented and they know they’re very vulnerable.

In November, ICE stopped a bus of farmworkers near Immokalee. They were mostly women and asylum seekers going to work, just trying to take care of their families. They dragged them from the bus. Who will take care of their kids? Along with the fear, how do you go about your daily life with so much uncertainty? It’s terrifying. Some farmworkers are leaving the country.

Alfaro: In April 2025, Border Patrol detained eight farmworkers at a farm where workers had really begun to organize and stand up for their rights. This had a big impact. People felt fear and no longer wanted to speak out and organize. Some stopped going out to get groceries. People are just now feeling enough courage to start organizing again.

Migrant Justice spoke with the detained workers and their families and we launched a public campaign. We had marches and rallies, and thousands of people signed our petition calling for their release. This had a huge impact. The workers being held behind bars knew that they weren’t alone and they knew that the community was behind them.

How has your organization responded over the past year to the Trump administration’s intensified attacks?

Alfaro: We’ve really focused on educating people about their rights and how to prepare for potential encounters with federal agents and minimize risk in those situations. We’ve been building a system of support through our rapid response network so people can respond when there’s a detention happening. We have people trained on how to intervene to defend a person’s rights when they see an arrest — though it’s difficult to respond in time in rural areas.

We have people trained to go observe anytime there’s a rumor about ICE or Border Patrol in an area. That lets us differentiate fact from fiction and helps with that sense of panic that the community feels. This rapid response network has been important for our community, because we haven’t felt so alone. There are people here in Vermont who have our backs.

Economos: We have five offices in Florida. We’ve been doing Know Your Rights trainings with workers across the state. We’ve been handing out red cards in the fields. Some employers have actually asked us to do Know Your Rights trainings for their workers, which is unusual. Some local businesses have put up signs saying they’re a safe place for immigrants.

We’ve been working in coalition with other organizations locally, statewide, and nationally. We have a rapid response group. We’re keeping track of detentions and deportations. We hope to publish a report on this soon.

We were lucky to escape any hurricanes this [past] year. We’ve been really worried about what to tell people if there’s an evacuation order or they need to find shelter. We’ve been contacting local governments about their policies around sheltering undocumented workers. We’re trying to protect people. How can people go to shelters if there is no guarantee that ICE won’t target them there? There’s so much fear and uncertainty.

Carrasco: There are so many groups organizing in Tucson. It’s getting bigger and bigger. People are really pissed off. The more they try to oppress us, the more people are coming out.

We tell people to take out their phone and start recording if someone’s being detained. It’s our right. We keep eight feet away from them. As soon as someone starts recording, ICE wants to go hide. They’ll be less violent toward people. They don’t want to be recorded, because they know sooner or later, we’re going to take them to court. We’ve been cataloging their cars and license plates.

We’re just so mad. These ICE agents don’t even show their faces. They kick us and do whatever they want. They’re the criminals. We have the right to protest.

A lady from Chicago is sending me whistles and offered to train us on how to respond to tear gas. But big cities like that are different from Tucson. They’re crunched up, so when ICE shows up, people pour out together. It’s difficult in Tucson because our city is so spread out, and we’re so close to the border, so it’s more militarized.

Can you talk about your hotline in Tucson?

Carrasco: Some days the phone is ringing off the hook. Just now, while we’re talking, I received three calls. We get a lot of calls in the morning because ICE is getting people on their way to work. This is every day. They’re not criminals. They’re workers.

We’re trying to help people get lawyers. We try to help as many people as we can. Every day is a different story. One worker called us last month. A guy hired him and exploited him and then brought him to ICE. Those are the kinds of abuses we’re seeing. They’re dehumanizing people and stealing their wages.

After the Taco Giro raids here, I got 48 calls. People wanted to join our meetings and our rapid response network. Even though we’re in a really bad situation, people who never helped before are coming out to defend the community. There’s hope out there.

We need people to have our number and call us if you see anything. Call me every time. We have more than 200 people who are ready to come out.

Rossy, you were personally impacted this past year. Can you talk about that?

Alfaro: This is really difficult for me to talk about. My family members, Nacho and Heidi, were detained by Border Patrol and then held in ICE detention for a month. They were detained completely in violation of their rights, and it was done very violently. Their window was shattered, and they were pulled out of the car.

They both knew their rights. They refused to provide any information about themselves to those immigration agents. The agents took them in without any cause. But that also gave them the ability to challenge their detention on legal grounds and helped get them released, because they could show there was an unlawful arrest.

My son and I suffered terribly from all the stress and sadness of having our family separated. They were held for several weeks. But they trusted their community to fight for them. They have very high profiles as community leaders and as fighters for human rights. That faith that the community would fight for their release sustained them during those months in detention, until they ultimately came home.

Have you seen any victories this past year that you want to lift up?

Alfaro: One victory we’re most proud of is the passage of the Housing Access for Immigrant Families Act, which makes it easier for immigrant families to find housing in the state. We campaigned for this and won it last year. For farmworkers especially, having access to housing that’s not associated with your job really opens up opportunities.

Also, the Education Equity law we won that went into effect this year allows undocumented students to attend university and pay the same rate and receive the same financial aid as their classmates who were born here. My daughter is one of the students benefiting from that. She’s able to go to college because of this law that we fought for and that she helped get passed.

Amid the challenges and heartbreak of this past year, what is keeping you motivated or even hopeful?

Economos: All I can say is I’m more committed than ever. There’s no way that we can turn our backs now. It’s personal, too. A community member who’s on our leadership committee — her nephew was sent to Alligator Alcatraz. When you know people, you feel their pain and it makes you more committed than ever before.

Seeing what other people are doing — young people, students standing in front of ICE or blocking a road, pastors going to immigration court to try and protect people; seeing the risks people are taking, just an outpouring of resistance around the country to what’s happening — that’s inspiring.

Carrasco: People are waking up. People who’ve never protested are coming out to defend our community. A really old lady called me the other day. She was so mad. She wanted to join us. Even white people want to join us — people who are less afraid and who’ve never been active in the community, but who are waking up to what’s happening.

I’m hopeful. People are always calling me to help. Our communities are coming together and they’re defending each other every day. We’ll keep working and defending our communities regardless of what they do to us.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2195715331-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:28.651350

(WLS) -- Massive crowds returned to the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Saturday to continue protesting against federal immigration operations.

This comes as the Trump administration is ramping up its immigration crackdown after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minnesota.

Despite the freezing temperatures, demonstrators organized peacefully, saying their message to the Trump administration is more important now than ever before.

""This is our country, and it belongs to we, the people, and it seems to have been taken over by a group of people who don't have our best interests at heart,"" said demonstrator Mary Moreland.

It was the first protest seen at the ICE processing facility in quite some time since thousands gathered there weekly at the peak of immigrations operations across Chicagoland. With escalating tensions in Minneapolis in recent weeks, protesters say, now is the time to keep organizing.

""What's happening here is bad, but Minnesota, my God, that's like, ground zero. And to use that much tear gas on a crowd, for what?"" said demonstrator David Kav.

Of course, Saturday's demonstration, led by the organization American Opposition, came as clashes between protesters and immigration agents continue in Minneapolis, especially after Good's shooting death less than two weeks ago.

And just days ago, tensions flared up in that city once again after a federal agent shot an alleged undocumented immigrant in the leg during a traffic stop. The Department of Homeland Security says the agent was also attacked. Demonstrators could be seen throwing fireworks in response as agents deployed chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, sources told ABC News that federal officials have opened an investigation into Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looking into whether they may have obstructed law enforcement activity in the state.

And while President Donald Trump and DHS Sec. Kristi Noem have said many anti-ICE protesters are paid agitators, demonstrators in Broadview pushed back against that narrative.

""I'm just an old white guy from the suburbs. I don't have a criminal record. I don't get paid for this. I do it because we have to. We have to get out in bad weather, good weather,"" said one protester, named Tony.

The crowd rallied right outside the west suburban ICE facility for a couple of hours before marching their way down 25th Street.

Alice Valentine and her girlfriend, Sofia Martin, learned through a Signal group chat that ICE agents were swooping down Monday on St. Cloud’s Star City Mall, which is home to many Somali-owned businesses, The Handbasket reports. They are fairly new to protests but wanted to help their neighbors. Both are queer and trans and are U.S. citizens.

“Within a few moments of arriving at the parking lot, they were shoved to the ground by agents, pepper sprayed, thrown in a van and hauled away,” according to the site.

That happened after they confronted ICE agents who got out of a car and brandished guns. “I'm not a gun person, but the guns were really big. They weren't just like standard police pistols,” Valentine said. “And so I started recording.”

When the couple asked why the agents were armed, one agent pushed Martin. “I say, ‘Don't shove my fucking girlfriend,’ and he shoves me,” Valentine told the site, “and then then it evolves really fast from there. Like I have pepper spray in my eyes. It’s all over my body. And they’re putting handcuffs on both of us.”

Then the women were thrown into a van, along with three others. Two of them were likely Somali, Valentine said. They were taken to ICE headquarters at the Whipple Building in Minneapolis, where each received one bottle of water but no treatment for their pepper spray wounds.

ICE agents questioned them separately, and an agent asked Martin about her genitalia and if she’d had gender-confirmation surgery. She answered truthfully to avoid being groped. It occurred to them that LGBTQ+ people were being singled out for mistreatment. In the van, they discussed ICE’s killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week. Valentine told Martin, “You know, I just realized that they probably knew Renee was a lesbian before they shot her.”

Also, while in her cell, Valentine heard another woman asking to call her girlfriend. What crossed Valentine’s mind was “Why are so many lesbians being fucked up by ICE right now?” she said.

Valentine and Martin were released after several hours. No one told them why they were released or what to expect next. The agents returned their belongings except for their cell phones.

Valentine sprained an ankle when being roughed up by ICE, and she has been unable to work because of that. She and Martin own a salon that provides massages and electrolysis, with a focus on queer and trans clients. But while being treated at urgent care, Valentine met a neighbor who’s also interested in countering ICE, so she remains committed to the effort.

“In retrospect, I would have done it again,” she told The Handbasket. “Like, it was the most miserable day of my whole life. But I would do it again because I think that people need to know how evil ICE is and that this is happening, and that this isn't about putting murderers and rapists away. It's about racism, it's about Nazism, it's about fascism, and we need to do anything we can to stop it.”",https://www.advocate.com/media-library/queer-trans-ice-protester-recounts-abuse-jailing-by-agents.jpg?id=62826547&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C39%2C0%2C39,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:32.229080

DOJ issued subpoenas for Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Friday, more than a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, sparking protests across the state and a brief threat by President Trump to send troops to the city.

“Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” the governor wrote on social platform X, responding to an article. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded to the subpoenas, calling them “an assault on our democracy and the rule of law.”

“Speaking out against what our government is doing is not a crime in America—not now, not ever,” she wrote on X.

Minnesota Reps. Betty McCollum (D) and Angie Craig (D) also expressed their support for the governor, taking a swing at the Trump administration’s actions.

McCollum wrote online that the country “deserves justice” and “not President Trump’s use of DOJ as a weapon against his perceived enemies.”

Craig called the move “even more proof that this has never been about making Minnesota safer.”

“It has always been about political retribution for President Trump and his allies,” the lawmaker wrote in a post on X. “I’m standing with @GovTimWalz and @MayorFrey.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also condemned the news, referencing the administration’s previous investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.

“First it was Tish James and James Comey. Now it’s Senators, Governors, and the Fed Chair,” Schumer posted to X, also referring to an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “In Donald Trump’s America you get a bogus investigation for doing your job. Americans reject this kind of totalitarian bullying. Where are Republicans? Hiding.”

Tensions between federal law enforcement and protesters were escalated after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer on Jan. 7 and a second shooting last week when a Venezuelan migrant was injured when he attempted to escape arrest.

A federal judge ordered on Friday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must limit the tactics ICE uses against protesters in Minnesota. In her order, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez wrote that the officials cannot retaliate against, arrest or detain “persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Walz’s comments, blasting Trump for investigating the Minnesota officials “instead of seeking justice for Renee Good.”

“We will not stand by silently and be bullied into submission,” the Massachusetts Democrat wrote on X.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who is also under investigation by the administration over his and other lawmakers’ decision to appear in a video advising members of the U.S. military not to obey “illegal” orders, called the DOJ’s subpoenas of Walz and Frey “un-American.”

“With each passing day, more and more of Donald Trump’s political opponents are finding themselves targeted by his Justice Department,” Kelly wrote online. “It’s not by accident. This is un-American, and we cannot allow it to continue.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said in a video posted to his X account that “Congress plays a big role here,” citing the upcoming vote on DHS’s budget.

“Especially given the escalation that is happening in Minnesota today, we should not be approving that budget unless there are constraints on Donald Trump’s illegality,” he said.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a post on X after news of the DOJ probe broke, wrote, “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.”

Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city.”

“I will not be intimidated,” he added. “My focus remains where it’s always been: keeping our city safe.”

""ICE needs to get off our streets. They are causing confusion, chaos and fear,"" Klobuchar said during the hearing.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has come under consistent attack from President Trump, said the administration is ""operating outside the bounds of law.""

Mayor Jacob Frey was among the witnesses who testified during the shadow hearing.

""This is not about immigration. This is about sewing chaos on the streets of Minnesota,"" Frey said. ""We in Minneapolis are suffering the brunt of it right now.""

The mayor added that as soon as federal agents leave, ""we will have peace, we will have safety and order will be restored.""

A Quinnipiac poll found 57% of voters disapproving of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws, with 40% approving, largely unchanged from Quinnipiac's previous polling in July. Most Democrats and independents disapprove of how ICE is enforcing laws; most Republicans approve.

A 58% majority disapproves of how Trump is handling immigration, while 42% approve, exactly the same as CNN measured in July.

The same poll found a slim 52% majority of Americans saying Trump's efforts to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally have gone too far, 31% said they have been about right and just 16% said they have not gone far enough.

The CNN poll found 61% of Americans disapproving of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's handling of her job, with just 38% approving -- worse than what Quinnipiac found among registered voters, more of whom voiced no opinion than in CNN's poll (36% approved, 52% disapproved).

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Jan. 8-12 among 1,133 registered voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points.

The CNN poll was conducted Jan. 9-12 among 1,209 U.S. adults with an error margin of +/- 3.1 percentage points.

A set of recently released polls found Americans largely at odds with the Trump administration and its defense of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who fatally shot Minneapolis woman Renee Good.

A Quinnipiac University poll found 53% of registered voters saying the shooting of Good was not justified, 35% saying it was justified and 12% with no opinion. Over 9 in 10 Democrats and roughly 6 in 10 independents said the shooting was not justified, but over three-quarters of Republicans said it was.

Similarly, a CNN poll found a 56% majority of Americans saying the shooting was an inappropriate use of force, with just 26% saying it was appropriate. Another 18% said they hadn't heard enough to say. About half (51%) said that the fatal shooting reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.

The CNN poll also found 51% of Americans saying ICE enforcement actions were making cities less safe, with 31% saying they were making cities safer and 18% saying ICE was having little effect on safety.

There's a partisan split here, with 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying ICE enforcement was making cities less safe and 67% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying it was making cities safer.

More Americans said in the CNN poll that they were concerned about crackdowns against those protesting deportations (47%) rather than the protests getting out of hand (37%).

And Americans voiced little trust in the federal government to carry out a fair and thorough investigation of the shooting in Minneapolis, according to the CNN poll, with 62% saying they had just some or no trust at all -- including nearly half (47%) who said they had no trust at all. Just 17% said they trust the government ""a great deal"" to investigate the shooting.

In all, according to the Quinnipiac poll, 82% of U.S. voters have seen the video of Good being fatally shot by the ICE agent.

A woman who was caught on video getting forcibly pulled from a vehicle by agents in Minneapolis on Tuesday said she feels ""lucky to be alive.""

The woman, Aliya Rahman, said she was driving to an appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when the incident occurred.

""Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,"" she said in a statement on Thursday. ""This happened just two blocks from where Renee Good was murdered, so I am very aware that this confrontation could have ended differently for me.""

Rahman said that while in federal custody she asked for a doctor but was taken to a detention center, where she said she lost consciousness before being taken to a hospital.

""I may have more to say in the coming days but for now, I am relieved to be safe and ask for privacy as I heal from my injuries and navigate how to move forward from this traumatic experience,"" she said.

In a statement on the incident, Homeland Security said a crowd ""began impeding law enforcement operations"" of ICE officers and that several people were taken into custody for assault.

""One agitator ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene, she was arrested for obstruction,"" the statement, which did not identify Rahman by name, said.

Earlier this year a different federal judge issued an order barring the LAPD from using less-lethal munitions against journalists and nonviolent protesters — a ruling that is under appeal.","A federal judge banned Los Angeles Police Department officers from using some so-called less-lethal launchers at protests, after finding that the department violated previous court restrictions by using such projectile weapons to disperse crowds at last summer’s mass demonstrations against immigration enforcement.

In her ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall sided with a contempt motion filed by attorneys for Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles.

That same day LAPD officials sent a department-wide memo announcing an immediate moratorium on the use of the 40-millimeter weapons in light of Marshall’s ruling. The memo advised those seeking further clarity to contact the department’s risk management and legal affairs division.

“Accordingly, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY the 40mm SHALL NOT be used during any CROWD CONTROL situation,” said the memo, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times.

A preliminary injunction handed down by Marshall in 2021 placed certain restrictions on the weapons’ use, including requiring specialized training for handlers; the issuance of a warning before firing such weapons; and restricting their use only to situations in which “the officer reasonably believes that a suspect is violently resisting arrest or poses an immediate threat of violence or physical harm.”

The latest order halts the use of a weapon, recognizable by its neon green handle, that has been used by police during recent protests to clear crowds after demonstrations were declared unlawful. The weapon launches projectiles the size of a mini soda can at speeds of more than 200 mph.

But attorneys for Black Lives Matters-L.A. argued that LAPD routinely flouted the injunction — citing numerous apparent violations in their contempt motion. Officers already were barred from firing their weapons from five feet away or closer, or from targeting a person’s head, groin or spine, but attorneys argued that police repeatedly did so.

One lawyer said the department also seemed to be violating its own guidelines governing the 40-millimeter’s use by shooting journalists and others in sensitive areas such as the head.

“And they’re certainly not supposed to shoot them in the back of the head as they’re trying to leave,” said Carol Sobel, a prominent attorney whose litigation forced the LAPD to scale back aggressive crowd-control practices in the past. “The bottom line is the LAPD is going to bankrupt the city with its refusal to follow the law.”

The motion also cited a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that found such weapons shouldn’t be used to disperse crowds. It was the latest legal challenge to the use of the 40-millimeter, which the LAPD also uses in day-to-day operations. The order doesn’t apply to such uses.

In the past the department issued similar, if temporary moratoriums on the use of other projectile weapons that fire so-called skip and beanbag rounds.

This week the City Council voted in favor of new limits on the deployment of LAPD officers at protests, encouraging a “graded response” in which officers in riot gear would be deployed only if needed.

Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan announced Friday that his administration is drafting an executive order that will prohibit the Buffalo police and other city departments from working with federal immigration agencies.

The order, he said, would ensure “no apparatus of city government interacts in any way with federal immigration.”

“And that’s going to be from building inspectors, to garbage collectors to police officers,” he said.

“What we don’t want is any chilling effect,” Ryan told civic and advocacy groups assembled at the Buffalo State University Alumni Visitor Center. “We don’t want people not coming to City Hall to avail themselves of services because they’re afraid that somehow their visit … is going to yield a phone call to immigration officials.”

Ryan did not give a timeline for signing the executive order, saying only that it would come “soon.”

Other cities, including Rochester and New York City, have laws in place that prohibit city employees from inquiring about a person’s immigration status and ban police from enforcing federal immigration law.

The mayor’s announcement follows Gov. Kathy Hochul’s endorsement Tuesday of two pieces of immigration-related legislation, part of her State of the State address.

One proposed law would allow New York residents to bring state-level civil lawsuits against federal immigration agents who they believe violate their constitutional rights. The second would ban immigration agents from schools, doctor offices, daycare centers and houses of worship unless they have a judicial warrant.

Hochul has yet to endorse the New York For All Act, which would provide a statewide ban on local law enforcement and other municipal employees from inquiring about a person’s immigration status or sharing information about their status with federal agents. New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins endorsed that bill earlier this month.

At Friday’s event — the annual legislative and policy briefing hosted by Partnership for the Public Good — advocates from organizations including Showing Up for Racial Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, and Justice for Migrant Families voiced support for New York For All and Ryan’s proposed executive order.

“An executive order of non-collusion will send a powerful and needed message of solidarity and hope to those who are now living in shock and fear,” said SURJ Buffalo member Allie Doran. “Stop waiting upon the state, stop hoping police will merely withstand the pressure to comply. We must take responsibility for our own city.”

Jennifer Connor, executive director of Justice for Migrant Families, urged the Ryan administration to implement the proposed executive order.

“As a city, we can ensure that our city resources are not being used to enforce a violent federal agenda against immigrants,” she said. “We can do it and we should do it.”

Investigative Post reported last month that a handful of local agencies, including the Erie County Sheriff’s Office and Cheektowaga Police Department frequently turn detained migrants over to border agents. Those agents then send migrants to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Residents in Cheektowaga this week protested that cooperation at a town council meeting, calling for a prohibition on the police force from working with federal immigration agencies.

Ryan on Friday said city police would still enforce criminal law against migrants but that such enforcement would not result in a call to federal immigration authorities.

“If there’s any criminal activity, regardless of someone’s immigration status, law enforcement gets involved, and that’s gonna continue,” he added. “But we’re going to make sure that no apparatus of the City of Buffalo’s government is working with Homeland Security and ICE to harass people.”

Ryan declined to say that his executive order constituted a “sanctuary city” policy, saying “I don’t know what those words mean.”

He noted that Buffalo has grown in population and tax base due to refugees and immigrants settling in the city.

“We are a city with [fewer] vacant houses and [fewer] vacant storefronts, for one prime reason. We have new Americans moving into the city of Buffalo,” he said. “Stopping immigrants from coming into Buffalo is bad for our economy.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7611.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:58:07.244054

""This is completely unprecedented in both its scale and scope and underlying motivation,"" said Peter Keisler, a senior official in the George W. Bush Justice Department.
The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported.
Joseph Tirrell was mindful of his job security from the very start of the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Michael Ben'Ary was driving one of his children to soccer practice on an October evening last year when he paused at a red light to check his work phone. He was in the middle of a counterterrorism prosecution so important that President Donald Trump highlighted it in his address to Congress.

Ben'Ary said he was shocked to see his phone had been disabled. He found the explanation later in his personal email account, a letter informing him he had been fired.

A veteran prosecutor, Ben'Ary handled high-profile cases over two decades at the Justice Department, including the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a suicide bomb plot targeting the U.S. Capitol. Most recently he was leading the case arising from a deadly attack on American service members in Afghanistan.

Yet the same credentials that enhanced Ben'Ary's résumé spelled the undoing of his government career.

His termination without explanation came hours after right-wing commentator Julie Kelly told hundreds of thousands of online followers that Ben'Ary had previously served as a senior counsel to Lisa Monaco, the No. 2 Justice Department official in Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. Kelly also suggested Ben'Ary was part of the ""internal resistance"" to prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey, even though Ben'Ary was never involved in the case.

As Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, approaches her first year on the job, the firings of lawyers such as Ben'Ary have defined her turbulent tenure. The terminations and a larger voluntary exodus of lawyers have erased centuries of combined experience and left the department with fewer career employees to act as a bulwark for the rule of law at a time when Trump, a Republican, is testing the limits of executive power by demanding prosecutions of his political enemies.

Interviews by The Associated Press of more than a half-dozen fired employees offer a snapshot of the toll throughout the department. The departures include lawyers who prosecuted violent attacks on police at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; environmental, civil rights and ethics enforcers; counterterrorism prosecutors; immigration judges; and attorneys who defend administration policies. This week, several prosecutors in Minnesota moved to resign amid turmoil over an investigation into the shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

""To lose people at that career level, people who otherwise intended to stay and now are either being discharged or themselves are walking away, is immensely damaging to the public interest,"" said Stuart Gerson, a senior official in the George H.W. Bush administration and acting attorney general early in Bill Clinton's administration. ""We're losing really capable people, people who have never viewed themselves as political and attempted to do the right thing.""

Justice Connection, a network of department alums, estimates that more than 230 lawyers, agents and other employees from across the department were fired last year, apparently because of their work on cases they were assigned or past criticism of Trump, or seemingly no reason. More than 6,400 employees are estimated to have left a department that at the end of 2025 had roughly 108,000, the group says.

The Justice Department says it has hired thousands of career attorneys over the past year. The Trump administration has characterized some of the fired and departed workers as out of step with its agenda.

Ben'Ary left with unfinished business, including the prosecution stemming from the airport bombing in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the national security unit he led at the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Left to pack his belongings, he posted a typed note near his door that functioned as a distress call, reminding colleagues they had sworn an oath to follow the facts ""without fear or favor"" and ""unhindered by political interference.""

But, he warned, ""In recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making American citizens less safe.""

Unparalleled in scale, scope and motivation

Since its founding in 1870, the Justice Department has occupied elevated status in American democracy, sustained through transitions of power by reliance on facts, evidence and law.

To be sure, there has always been a political component to the department, with lawyers appointed by the president.

But even during turbulent times, when attorneys general have been pushed out by presidents or resigned rather than accede to White House demands — as in the Watergate-era ""Saturday Night Massacre"" — the department's rank and file have generally been insulated thanks to long-recognized civil service protections.

""This is completely unprecedented in both its scale and scope and underlying motivation,"" said Peter Keisler, a senior official in the George W. Bush Justice Department.

In his first term, Trump pushed out one attorney general and accepted another's resignation, but the workforce remained largely intact. He returned to office in January 2025 seething over Biden-era prosecutions of him and vowing retribution.

The firings began even before Bondi arrived in February. Prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team that investigated Trump were terminated days after the inauguration, followed by prosecutors hired on temporary assignments for cases resulting from the Capitol insurrection in 2021.

""The people working on these cases were not political agents of any kind,"" said Aliya Khalidi, a Jan. 6 prosecutor who was fired. ""It's all people who just care about the rule of law.""

The firings have continued, at times surgical, at times random and almost always without explanation.

Adam Schleifer, a Los Angeles prosecutor targeted in a social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer over past critical comments of Trump, was fired in March. The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported. Reuveni later accused the department of trying to mislead judges to execute deportations. Department officials deny the assertion.

Two weeks after Maurene Comey completed a sex trafficking trial against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, the New York prosecutor was fired, also without explanation. Like Ben'Ary, she wrote a pointed farewell, telling colleagues that ""fear is the tool of a tyrant."" Her father, the former FBI director who was a frequent Trump target, said those same words after being indicted in September in a case that has been dismissed.

Among the most affected sections is the storied Civil Rights Division. A recent open letter of protest was signed by more than 200 employees who left in 2025, with several supervisors recently giving notice of plans to depart. The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes sensitive public corruption cases, has also been hollowed out by resignations.

The Justice Department has disputed the accounts of some of those who have been fired or quit and has defended the termination of those who investigated Trump as ""consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.""

""This is the most efficient Department of Justice in American history, and our attorneys will continue to deliver measurable results for the American people,"" the department said in a statement. More than 3,400 career attorneys have been hired since Trump took office, the department says.

The departures have caused backlogs and staff shortages, with senior leaders soliciting job applications. It has affected the department's daily business as well as efforts to fulfill Trump's desires to prosecute political opponents.

Desperate for lawyers willing to file criminal cases against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the administration in September forced out the veteran U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no experience as a federal prosecutor.

Halligan secured the indictments but the win was short-lived.

One judge later identified grave missteps in how Halligan presented the Comey case to a grand jury. Another dismissed both prosecutions outright, calling Halligan's appointment unlawful.

Smith, the special counsel who investigated Trump but left before he could be fired, has himself lamented the losses. ""These are not partisans,"" he recently told lawmakers.

""They just want to do good work,"" he added, ""and I think when you lose that culture, you lose a lot.""

'Our dream was to be federal prosecutors'

Khalidi joined the department in 2023 in a group of new prosecutors hired to help with the hundreds of cases stemming from the Capitol riot.

Upon Trump's return to the White House, she watched cases she prosecuted get dismantled by Trump's sweeping clemency for all 1,500 defendants charged in the riot, including those who attacked police.

Less than two weeks later, a Justice Department demand for the names of FBI agents involved in Jan. 6 investigations triggered rumors of potential mass firings. Worried about the agents she worked with, Khalidi spent the day checking in on them. But as she started preparing dinner one Friday evening, she received an email suggesting she had lost her own job.

Attached was a memo from then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordering the firings of prosecutors such as Khalidi who had been hired for temporary assignments but were moved into permanent roles after Trump's win, a maneuver Bove called ""subversive personnel actions by the previous administration."" Neither the email nor memo identified the fired prosecutors, leaving them to guess.

Khalidi grabbed a suitcase to collect family photos and other personal items she kept at work and rushed to the office, retreating with fellow shocked prosecutors to a bar where they received termination emails.

The group of 15 fired attorneys later assembled to surrender their computers and phones, entering the same room where they gathered on their first day in 2023.

""For a lot of us, our dream was to be federal prosecutors,"" Khalidi said. ""And so we had happy memories of that room, of being excited on our first day. So it was just kind of surreal to be back there turning in our stuff.""

The news came for Anam Petit, an immigration judge, during a break between hearings.

Hired during the Biden administration, she said she felt a little uneasy when Trump won the election but also figured her position would probably be safe because immigration judges generally have job stability and because they bear responsibility for issuing removal orders for those who are in the United States illegally, a core presidential priority.

Petit arrived on Sept. 5 bracing for bad news because it was the Friday of the pay period before her two-year work anniversary, when her probationary appointment was poised to become permanent. Though she said she had received strong performance reviews and had already exceeded her case completion goal for the year, she had become anxious as colleagues were fired amid an administration push to accelerate deportations.

She was in the courtroom between hearings when she learned via email that she had been fired. She left to text her husband, then returned to the courtroom to render a decision in the case before her.

""I just put my phone back in my pocket and went into the courtroom and delivered my decision, with a very shaky voice and shaky hands, trying to center myself back to that decision just so that I could relay it,"" Petit said.

Joseph Tirrell was mindful of his job security from the very start of the Trump administration. As the department's chief ethics officer, he had affirmed that Smith, the special counsel, was entitled to a law firm's free legal services, a decision he sensed had the potential to rile incoming leadership.

But he remained in the position and over the ensuing months counseled Bondi's staff on the propriety of accepting various gifts, including a cigar box from mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor.

He was fired in July, just before a FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey that Tirrell had said Bondi could not ethically accept a free invitation to. He was not terribly surprised, he says, when it was later reported that Bondi attended in Trump's box. The Justice Department said in a statement that none of Tirrell's advice ""was ever overruled"" and that ""the Attorney General obtained ethics approval to attend this event in her official capacity as a member of the FIFA Task Force.""

""There's a great deal of fear there just because I was fired and just because so many others were summarily fired,"" Tirrell said. ""Are you going to get fired because you provided ethics advice? Are you going to get fired because you have a pride flag on your desk?""

'Our country depends on you'

Trump was promoting his administration's commitment to counterterrorism during his address to Congress in March when he announced a success: the capture of a militant from the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate who was charged in the Kabul airport bombing that killed 13 American service members during the 2021 withdrawal from the country.

Mohammad Sharifullah arrived the following day in the United States, encountering Ben'Ary in an Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom.

Ben'Ary spent the next several months working on the case, but on Oct. 1, he was fired. It was the apparent result, he told colleagues, of a social media post he said contained ""false information"" — a reference to the one from Kelly, the commentator.

The termination was so abrupt that Ben'Ary could not tell his colleagues where he had saved important filings and notes. Another prosecutor listed on the case, James Comey's son-in-law, Troy Edwards, had resigned days earlier upon Comey's indictment. Once set for trial last month, the case has been postponed.

In his farewell note, Ben'Ary observed that he was not alone, that in ""just a few short months"" career employees like himself had been removed from U.S. attorneys offices, the FBI ""and other critical parts of DOJ.""

""While I am no longer your colleague, I ask that each of you continue to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,"" Ben'Ary wrote. ""Follow the facts and the law. Stand up for what we all believe in — our Constitution and the rule of law. Our country depends on you.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/17/AP26009728317687_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:04.448984

Walz says Trump has 'weaponized' federal justice system

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of Minnesota officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, over an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents, a source familiar with the probe said on Friday.

The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said subpoenas were prepared for Walz and Frey as part of the inquiry, but it was not immediately clear whether they had been served.

The investigation, first reported by CBS News, stems from statements made by Walz and Frey about the thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents deployed to the Minneapolis region in recent weeks under orders from President Donald Trump, the source said.

Reacting on social media to news of the investigation, Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for the vice presidency in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump's perceived political enemies.

""Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,"" Walz said.

The governor was referring to U.S. Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, Democrats from Michigan and Arizona, who made a video statement urging members of the military to resist illegal orders, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has criticized as being too hesitant to raise interest rates.

Reacting to a CNN report on the investigation, Frey said separately: ""This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city.""

The Justice Department declined to comment. But U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a message on social media platform X on Friday evening, saying: ""A reminder to all those in Minnesota; No one is above the law.""

It would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors to bring a criminal conspiracy case based on statements from public officials about government policies.

The Trump administration has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota since early last week, triggering angry protests in Minneapolis over the surge in immigration agents on the streets of the state's most populous city.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense after an ICE agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, 37, behind the wheel of her car, in Minneapolis on January 7, triggering daily protests that have spread to other cities.

Although he has urged protesters to remain peaceful, Walz also has encouraged citizens to record video of any arrests or other encounters between ICE agents and members of the public in order to create a database for potential ""future prosecution"" of wrongdoing by law enforcement.

Walz and Frey have repeatedly demanded that Trump end the ICE deployment, saying the militarized deportation drive was a reckless operation aimed at sowing chaos, fear and headlines, and was putting civilians in danger.

Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche earlier this week blamed Walz and Frey for the confrontations and said he was focused on stopping them by ""whatever means necessary, opens new tab

Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns.
In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.","A federal judge in California this week struck down the Justice Department's demand for the state to hand over sensitive voter roll data, ruling that it would trample on residents' privacy rights and potentially disenfranchise voters.

""The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,"" said David Carter, a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of California, in a ruling on Thursday.

""The case before the Court is one of these cuts that imperils all Americans. The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the Legislative Branch, not the Executive. The Constitution demands such respect, and the Executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here.""

The decision is the first formal court decision of what is expected to be many, after the Justice Department filed nearly two dozen lawsuits around the country ordering states to hand over voter roll data containing sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, addresses and driver's license numbers.

Another federal judge in Oregon, meanwhile, separately signaled earlier this week he tentatively plans to dismiss the Justice Department's voter roll lawsuit against the state.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has sent demands to at least 43 states so far asking them to hand over voter roll data, according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice. On Friday, the division added another, filing a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Virginia for failing to produce its voter registration lists.

The Civil Rights Division has claimed it needs the data to ensure compliance with two federal laws — the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act — which require states to establish programs for maintaining clean voting lists so people ineligible to vote, such as convicted felons.

But government documents previously reviewed by CBS News show that the Justice Department is actually working with the Department of Homeland Security to hand over the data so that it can be used in pursuit of criminal and immigration investigations.

Justice Department officials have not communicated their plans to share the data with DHS with the states.

In an Aug. 28 virtual meeting with secretaries of state, a former Civil Rights Division official told them the data would only be used to ensure they had clean voter lists and pledged to analyze the information ""securely and discreetly,"" according to notes on the meeting shared with CBS News by a participant.

Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns. The federal Privacy Act requires the government to provide public notice and comment before it collects records on individuals.

The Justice Department has argued it also has a right to access the data under the Civil Rights Act, which requires states to retain voter registration records for up to 22 months after an election.

The law states that the Justice Department can issue a written demand to inspect the records, but it must provide ""a statement of the basis and the purpose"" for the request.

In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.

He also cited prior media reports showing that the true purpose behind the data request is to use it for immigration and criminal enforcement.

""The Court does not take lightly DOJ's obfuscation of its true motives in the present matter,"" Carter wrote. ""Congress passed the NVRA, Civil Rights Act, and HAVA to protect voting rights. If the DOJ wants to instead use these statutes for more than their stated purpose, circumventing the authority granted to them by Congress, it cannot do so under the guise of a pretextual investigative purpose.""

Dax Goldstein, the Election Protection Program Director at the States United Democracy Center, hailed the decision from the court on Thursday.

""Today the court sent a clear message: states run elections, not the administration,"" Goldstein said in a statement to CBS.

""This decision serves as a vindication of what states have been arguing for months: There is no legal basis for the federal government's sweeping demands for voters' most sensitive information.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/16/9d60cdc3-b220-4bdd-bf6c-97278f4c9c47/thumbnail/1200x630/c513578ac422aa0e43a0c4b6511b979b/gettyimages-2244588264.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:45.057755

Whether ICE or some other law enforcement officer asks you that question, don’t answer it, Hwang said.

He recommends using the same question: “Am I free to go?”

If the officer says no, and you’re undocumented, Hwang said your best bet is to, once again, remain silent and ask to speak with a lawyer.

“ICE needs probable cause to arrest you, and if they don’t know who you are, the only way that they can get that probable cause to arrest you is through things that you say to them,” Hwang said. “That’s why they’re asking you these questions. That’s why they’re going to keep badgering you — to give them enough information that allows them to arrest you.”

What shouldn’t you do?

Don’t try to run away or flee the situation, Hwang said.

In addition, don’t lie to an officer or show any false documents.

“If you do any of these things, then that might give them sort of probable cause to be able to then detain you and arrest you,” Hwang said.

Should you film ICE agents?

Hwang says yes — in fact, bystanders play a more critical role than ever in this moment.

“Having video, graphic evidence of what ICE is actually doing is incredibly important,” he said. “Not just for the person who’s subject to this enforcement … but really to hold ICE accountable — to try to change their actions and show them that they can’t keep pushing the line [and] that what they are doing is improper and illegal.”

Although ICE agents can certainly tell people to stop filming, you don’t have to stop.

“Courts have long recognized the right to record law enforcement carrying out their duties in public spaces,” Hwang said. “We do this because we have to be able to hold officials accountable for their actions.”

But at the same time, Hwang said, use your best judgment.

Before recording, he recommended asking yourself: Will recording escalate the situation? Are you in a safe position? Is the person interacting with ICE in a safer position with you recording?

What should you do with ICE footage?

One thing Hwang asks is that people don’t live stream or post to social media without permission from the detainee.

“There are immigrants and people in our country who come here fleeing persecution, and they may have good reasons to not want their face publicized or their names out there — because they fear harm or some retribution,” he said.

Instead, Hwang recommends sharing any videos or other evidence with a family member of the person, if you know them, or contacting local legal or nonprofit organizations that work with immigrants.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/13eff34b92a22fce8cb3cd8f9c948825.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:41.119673

NPR reporters on the ground in Minneapolis have witnessed federal agents pulling people off the streets and out of their cars or questioning people of color on their immigration status.

In response, community members have protested, throwing snowballs at federal agents and blocking ICE vehicles. In turn, agents have deployed tear gas, tackled, or arrested those demonstrators.

Experts on immigration and policing say what is unfolding in Minneapolis reflects a broader national shift: federal immigration authorities are pushing the limits of their power, deploying to cities with little formal coordination with local officials — a move that is creating confusion, fear and mistrust.

The Trump administration, however, says this is what Americans want, and the actions of immigration in Minnesota are justified.

In a statement to NPR, Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin says, ""President Trump and [DHS] Secretary Noem are delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens.""

McLaughlin continues, ""70% of illegal aliens arrested by ICE have been charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S. The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden's open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Data published by the University of California Berkeley's Deportation Data Project shows that in the first nine months of President Trump's second term, around 75,000 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not have a criminal record – over a third of all ICE arrests.

Shifting norms

The scenes in Minneapolis underscore how dramatically immigration enforcement has changed, says Nithya Nathan-Pineau, a policy attorney and strategist with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an advocacy group that provides legal resources for immigrants

""These sort of established ways of working … really seem to have eroded and changed,"" she says, pointing to more physically aggressive tactics by agents when arresting individuals and in responding to protesters.

Just months ago, NPR published a guide explaining what is — and is not — legal during ICE encounters. Even then, legal experts warned it was ""a very confusing time for lawyers and the public alike.""

Since then, advocates say, federal authorities have pushed the boundaries of enforcement practices even further, making it harder for people to know their rights or trust they will be respected.

""There's always a fear of telling somebody, well, these are your rights, and then realizing that that officer might not, at that moment, recognize them,"" says Janice Iwama, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., who studies immigration and policing.

A confusing collection of federal agencies enforce immigration law

On Thursday, the ACLU and its Minnesota chapter filed another lawsuit against the federal government on the behalf of three Minnesotans challenging ""the administration's policy of racially profiling, unlawfully seizing, and unlawfully arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause.""

More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are currently operating in Minnesota, a number that officials say is expected to increase.

In her statement to NPR, McLaughlin says that Operation Metro Surge, the name of the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, ""is the largest DHS operation in history.""

The Department of Homeland Security declined to get into specific resources or the number of personnel.

There's a patchwork of federal agents - all trained in different policing methods – carrying out immigration enforcement. Based on NPR reporter observations the deployment in Minneapolis includes agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Bureau of Prisons – agencies typically focused on criminal investigations or running the nation's prisons rather than civil immigration enforcement.

Minneapolis isn't the only place this has happened. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives have been involved in immigration operations in other cities, according to analysis by the CATO Institute, a Libertarian think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

Nathan-Pineau said that in her 15 years working in immigration law, she has never seen operations ""of this scale launched in so many locations in such a short period of time.""

That's even considering former President Barack Obama's two terms in office, which were characterized by record-high deportation numbers. The American Immigration Council says from fiscal year 2009-2016, the U.S. saw more than 2.7 million deportations – at the time more people than any other president in U.S. history.

Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske agrees, ""this is unique and different [from] anything that's ever been done.""

Tensions arise over tactics and training

Former Commissioner Kerlikowske says immigration law is among the most complex areas of U.S. law, blending civil and criminal elements — and that most federal agents now participating in these operations have no background or training in it.

He says the same is true for policing dense, urban environments.

""The Border Patrol is called the Border Patrol for a reason, and they work best in these isolated areas along the border or within 25 miles of the border at checkpoints. Policing an urban environment is very, very different"" and requires special skills and knowledge, he says.

Those training gaps, he says, are visible in videos from Minneapolis and other cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, where federal agents have used pepper balls and tear gas in ways that violate standard policing practices.

In her statements to NPR, McLaughlin strongly defends the training and experience of agents on the ground and their tactics, explaining they are ""subject to months of training,"" which includes de-escalation and arrest techniques, firearms instruction and conflict management.

But Kerlikowske says he sees officers that are "" totally unprepared and incapable of handling these crowds,"" he said. ""They're not only intense and aggressive – they're operating outside of any of the standard practices of a law enforcement agency.""

He pointed to videos showing officers firing pepper balls directly at people or throwing tear gas canisters from moving vehicles — tactics he said no police department allows.

""They are totally unchecked,"" he says.

However, the Trump administration maintains agents are well-trained, but are dealing with aggressive protesters.

DHS tweeted about a Jan. 13 incident during which ICE arrested four people they call ""illegal aliens."" While officers made these arrests, ""a significant crowd surrounded them and began impeding law enforcement operations — a federal crime. One agitator ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene, she was arrested for obstruction,"" according to the post.

In response to criticism over training, assistant secretary McLaughlin says, ""DHS law enforcement officers are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.""

Targeted operations are no longer the norm. What does that mean for residents?

Historically, immigration enforcement focused on targeted arrests of people with final orders of deportation or conducting workplace raids based on specific intelligence.

For months now, immigration agents have been seen riding in unmarked vehicles to public spaces and making arrests.

Many of these arrests are being done in public because officers are still required to have a warrant to conduct any type of search or seizure, says Iwama, the American University professor.

ICE and Border Patrol agents have the authority to question and detain people they believe are in the country unlawfully, but experts say the way that authority is being exercised raises serious concerns.

Vice President JD Vance said in a press conference recently that immigration agents plan to go door to door in an attempt to find undocumented immigrants. Whether agents are actually doing this has yet to be confirmed by NPR.

On Monday, NPR witnessed multiple instances where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people, including some U.S. citizens, about their immigration status. Some took place in the parking lots of big box stores. All of the people questioned were people of color. All of them were able to prove they were in the U.S. legally after showing documentation.

Kerlikowske says agents are increasingly relying on these so-called ""Kavanaugh stops,"" which are brief detentions based on minimal suspicion, which can quickly escalate.

Assistant Secretary McLaughlin continues to defend the actions of agents, telling NPR ""allegations that ICE engages in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE…. A person's immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity.""

What is the long-term impact of this kind of operation?

It's standard practice for federal agencies and local police to coordinate a joint task force for major crime events. Except for immigration, says Kerlikowske, where there may not be the same level of coordination, since immigration enforcement rests entirely with the federal government.

""You don't want to be a police chief and then have a federal agency parachute into your city and start taking enforcement action without some level of communication and coordination,"" says Kerlikowske, who spent nine years in Seattle as a police chief prior to his work with the federal government.

""But it's very clear that that is not happening in any of these cities,"" he adds.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office says they are not working with federal agencies in their immigration enforcement. There are six local law enforcement agencies within the state of Minnesota that have a 287(g) agreement – which means they are coordinating with federal authorities on immigration enforcement, according to ICE's own database.

McLaughlin said in response to NPR's question on current efforts to get Minneapolis-area law enforcement agencies to sign 287(g) agreements, ""We would love for state and local law enforcement to sign 287(g) agreements to help us remove criminal illegal aliens from Minnesota. 287(g) is critical to having the enforcement we need to arrest criminal illegal aliens across the country.""

The Trump administration's position is that these street-level enforcement actions wouldn't be necessary if sanctuary cities, like Minneapolis, didn't prevent ICE from picking up undocumented individuals from local jails.

""Why are DHS law enforcement surging to sanctuary cities? Because sanctuary jurisdictions won't let us in their jails to arrest the violent criminal illegal aliens in their custody,"" says McLaughlin. ""As a result, DHS officers are forced to find the released criminal illegal aliens on the streets WITHOUT the support of local law enforcement.""

But the continued presence of federal agents ""puts local police officers in an impossible position,"" says Iwama. Because most residents are not differentiating between the federal agents they see taking away their immigrant neighbors and local police they see in their communities.

This is especially unfortunate given that local police in Minneapolis have worked in recent years following the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests to regain the trust of residents, she said. ""And of course, here now you have this event happening which is out of their control.""

The consequences, Iwama and Kerlikowske say, will ripple beyond immigration enforcement, affecting crime reporting, community cooperation and public safety across entire cities.

There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.","A US federal judge has issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) towards ""peaceful and unobstructive"" protesters in Minneapolis.

Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents.

The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.

The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.

On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.

The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer.

Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and ""using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity"".

The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from ""stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering"" with their work.

""The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,"" it says.

In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency ""is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters"".

The White House also criticised the ruling.

""This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative,"" spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. ""Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene.""

Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city.

There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.

Additionally on Friday, the justice department announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations.

Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city.

""A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law,"" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement.

The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey.

The order follows widespread outrage over a fatal shooting, reports of US citizens getting detained and Minnesotans getting asked for documents for no clear reason.

The new restrictions came as word spread that the Department of Justice is investigating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over possible obstruction of federal law enforcement, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The probe raises the possibility of criminal consequences for the two Democrats, who have repeatedly told protesters to remain peaceful and to “not take the bait” that could lead to a heavier federal response.

Despite wind chills that plummeted below zero, throngs of demonstrators protested in the snow Friday night near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis.

Demonstrations intensified last week after 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot in her car by an ICE agent. Tensions flared again this week when another agent shot and injured a Venezuelan man accused of “violently” resisting arrest, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ruling protects peaceful protests

Federal agents from Operation Metro Surge are not allowed to arrest or retaliate against peaceful protesters or use “pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools” against them, US District Judge Katherine Menendez ruled in a preliminary injunction issued Friday.

Menendez also said the agents can no longer stop and detain drivers when there is “no reasonable articulable suspicion” they are forcibly obstructing or interfering with federal operations. “The act of safely following” the officers “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge added.

The order only applies in Minnesota and only to agents involved in the current operation, and does not apply to other federal officers handling routine duties elsewhere, the order specified.

In a response to the ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said despite these threats, agents follow training and use “the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The preliminary injunction was requested by activists who filed a lawsuit last month alleging the federal government was violating their constitutional rights. The case is separate from a different lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the Twin Cities on Monday seeking a court-ordered end to what it calls a “federal invasion” during Operation Metro Surge.

The Trump administration accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of ""actively organizing"" anti-ICE resistance after officials from the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) accused the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of lying about how the state is handling its illegal immigration problem.

DHS called on Walz and Frey earlier this week to honor federal immigration detainers for the more than 1,300 illegal aliens that the federal agency said the state of Minnesota had in custody, accusing officials in the state of releasing nearly 470 criminal illegal immigrants onto Minneapolis' streets. Walz's office subsequently disputed DHS's claim, calling it ""categorically false"" that the state does not honor federal immigration detainers, meant to hold criminal illegal aliens in custody after committing a crime until Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can come pick them up.

In a press release Thursday, the Minnesota DOC echoed Walz's verbiage that DHS's claims were ""categorically false,"" adding that they are ""unsupported by facts and deeply irresponsible"" as well. The Minnesota DOC also claimed that they have ""always"" coordinated with ICE agents when individuals in custody have detainers.

""DHS’s assertion that 1,360 non-U.S. citizens are in Minnesota’s state custody is inexplicable. Minnesota’s total state prison population is approximately 8,000 individuals, and only 207 (less than 3 percent) are non-U.S. citizens. Further, in 2025, 84 individuals with ICE detainers were released. In each case, ICE was notified in advance and DOC staff coordinated with ICE officials to facilitate the custody transfer when requested.""

According to the Minnesota DOC, DHS did not identify which ""jurisdictions, systems, or timeframes"" were relied upon by the agency to support their numbers, and said that they did not align ""with DOC records or the reality of Minnesota's prison system.""

But the Trump administration stood behind their numbers and claims in a statement to Fox News Digital from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, arguing Walz and Frey were ""actively encouraging an organized resistance to ICE and federal law enforcement officers.""

""As DHS stated, across the state of Minnesota nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens including violent criminal illegal aliens have been RELEASED into communities. We have more than 1,360 active detainers on illegal aliens in the custody across all jurisdictions in Minnesota,"" McLaughlin said. ""We are once again calling on Governor Walz and his fellow sanctuary politicians to commit to honoring all ICE detainers.""

REPUBLICANS URGE TRUMP NOT TO INVOKE INSURRECTION ACT IN MINNEAPOLIS AMID UNREST AFTER ICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING

On the heels of a fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month involving federal ICE officers, Minneapolis Mayor Frey told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to ""get the f---- out"" of his city, while Walz similarly told the Trump administration to ""leave Minnesota alone."" Mayor Frey has also issued an executive order prohibiting federal agents from using city property to conduct operations, and a city separation ordinance was recently bolstered by local Minneapolis officials to protect illegal immigrants.

Meanwhile, in February, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal opinion arguing state law prohibited state and local law enforcement from holding someone solely on an ICE civil detainer.

The danger of not properly adhering to ICE detainers reared its head in December after an illegal immigrant with a detainer in Northern Virginia was released from custody and then subsequently killed someone a day later.

In one panicked call after another, witnesses told police what they had seen: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the street, several shots fired at a driver, her vehicle slamming into other cars, blood everywhere.

""ICE fired shots into her windshield,"" another caller said, as the operator urged the person to slow their breathing. ""She's bleeding.""

Later, as Good was being pronounced dead at a local hospital, police were trying to evacuate ICE officers from the scene while angry protesters cut down crime-scene tape around the area, according to an incident report that recorded communications between emergency responders.

""ICE BEING SURROUNDED,"" one person transmitted at 11:01 a.m., about 80 minutes after the shooting, according to the report.

The transcripts surfaced hours before news that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Minnesota officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, over an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed reports in the Washington Post, CBS News and other outlets that the probe stems from statements made by Walz and Frey, both Democrats, about the thousands of federal agents deployed to the Minneapolis region in recent weeks. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.

Both officials along with other Minnesota Democrats have denounced the ICE operation and Good's death, and they accused Trump of intentionally fomenting chaos.

THOUSANDS OF FEDERAL AGENTS SENT TO MINNESOTA

Minnesota's most populous city has seen increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers since Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot behind the wheel of her car on January 7 by an ICE officer, Jonathan Ross.

At the time, Good was taking part in one of numerous neighborhood patrols organized by local activists to track and monitor ICE activities.

The shooting came a day after the Trump administration announced the deployment of 2,000 immigration agents to Minneapolis in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called its largest such operation in history.

The surge in DHS personnel has since grown to nearly 3,000, dwarfing the ranks of local police officers in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Since the ICE surge, agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars. Some officers have found themselves surrounded by onlookers jeering and shouting at them for stopping Blacks and Latinos who turned out to be U.S. citizens.

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has floated the idea of creating a public database of people arrested on suspicion of interfering with ICE operations or assaulting officers, saying on Fox News on Thursday their identities would then be known to their employers and neighbors.

Trump administration officials have complained about what they call the ""doxing"" of federal agents, including Ross, saying that puts officers at risk, leading them to wear masks to protect their identities.

In the case of the Good shooting, Trump and other administration officials accused her of deliberately trying to run over Ross and other agents at the scene with her car. Videos showed she turned her wheels away from the officers, and Democratic city and state officials have rejected the government's account as false.

The Trump administration has said Ross was injured during the incident - although video shows him walking around afterward - while noting he was seriously hurt months earlier in an unrelated traffic stop that resulted in him being dragged behind a vehicle.

MINNEAPOLIS ARRESTS

Trump has said the Minneapolis deployment was prompted in part by allegations of fraud among the state's large Somali American community. Trump has called Somali immigrants ""garbage"" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

The DHS said on X that 12 ""agitators"" were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting law enforcement, without providing details.

As Trump's deportation drive in Minneapolis neared the end of its second week, the Good shooting remained the only fatality associated with the surge.

Fire department records showed paramedics were on the scene four minutes after the shooting was reported, finding Good in her car unresponsive with four apparent gunshot wounds, including one to her head and two to her chest.

Emergency personnel tried to revive her, both at the scene and in the ambulance en route to the hospital. She was pronounced dead less than an hour after being shot.

Meanwhile, at the shooting scene, police were trying to prevent more violence, according to an incident report that recorded communications among first responders.

""CROWD GETTING HOSTILE,"" the incident record reads at 9:50 a.m., 12 minutes after the shooting. ""CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE.""

At 11:01 a.m., ICE agents were ""being surrounded,"" and protesters were throwing snowballs at them – but not at police, the report says. The agents finally left the scene by 11:20 a.m.

On Friday, at the spot where Good was shot, a makeshift memorial continued to grow and attract visitors, despite frigid temperatures and falling snow.

Residents have cordoned off the area where Good's car slammed into a light pole, while hand-painted signs call for justice and include anti-ICE slogans.

Rand Paul, to convene oversight hearings and call Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify, after the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Good's fatal shooting on Jan. 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer has sparked days of protests and heated clashes with federal officers, and it's prompted renewed scrutiny of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.

In a letter first obtained by CBS News, Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led by ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, called on Paul, a Kentucky senator, to use the panel's authority to hold hearings and potentially issue subpoenas to senior administration officials.

In addition to Noem and Homan, the lawmakers said ICE acting director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino should be called before the committee.

The senators said the deployment of federal agents has occurred ""without appropriate coordination with state and local law enforcement."" They also accused federal officers of engaging in ""numerous operations involving excessive uses of force,"" including in the case of Good's killing.

Good sustained at least three gunshot wounds, and possibly a fourth, according to a Minneapolis Fire Department incident report obtained by CBS News Minnesota. The newly released details followed a week of protests in Minnesota that prompted President Trump to threaten invoking the Insurrection Act. The rarely used law would allow him to deploy the U.S. military to the state or federalize the National Guard.

Democrats say Good's killing is part of a broader pattern. They catalogued incidents beyond Minnesota, alleging federal agents appear to have used excessive force in firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters, detaining U.S. citizens during immigration raids — despite proof of citizenship — and deploying tear gas and pepper balls against journalists covering demonstrations.

The lawmakers also expressed concern about agents conducting operations while masked and their use of unmarked vehicles, both practices they say have fueled fear and confusion in communities.

The senators accuse DHS leadership of failing to fairly and transparently investigate such incidents. They faulted Noem for claiming publicly that ""no American citizens have been arrested or detained,"" despite lawsuits, rulings and reporting that indicate otherwise, and for stating in the immediate aftermath of Good's killing that she had committed an act of domestic terrorism.

In response to the Democrats' letter, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, ""DHS is a law enforcement agency — enforcing the rule of law passed by Congress. If members don't like the law, it is quite literally their job to change it.""

She added, ""As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, politicians are more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually removing criminals from our streets.""

Noem last testified before Congress on Dec. 11, during a contentious House hearing on immigration enforcement that ended abruptly when she left early, a move Democrats criticized as evading oversight. A subsequent Democratic effort to subpoena her testimony was blocked by Republicans.

The push for Senate hearings comes as Congress negotiates funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers passed a three-bill package this week funding several federal agencies, but left DHS unresolved after Democrats said they would not support a funding bill without new accountability measures for ICE.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats in both chambers are demanding changes to ICE's conduct as part of the appropriations process, ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline.

The oversight demand also comes as ICE operations expand nationwide. CBS News reported Friday that the agency's detainee population has reached a record high of 73,000.

With Republicans in control of the Senate, Democrats cannot compel hearings or subpoenas on their own. But the letter places pressure on the GOP chairman at a moment when scrutiny of ICE operations, DHS leadership and federal enforcement tactics is intensifying.

ICE restraining order granted

What we know:

The order granted late Friday by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez bans agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles who are not interfering with or obstructing federal agents or following them from a safe distance.

The order applies to ""all persons who do or will in the future record, observe, and/or protest Operation Metro Surge and related operations that have been ongoing… since Dec. 4, 2025.""

The backstory:

Menendez initially declined to bring an immediate end to the ICE surge in Minnesota during a court hearing two days earlier, instead ruling to fast-track arguments in the lawsuit, while demanding federal authorities submit its response by Monday, Jan. 19.

The State of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed the lawsuit and motion for a temporary restraining order in an attempt to bring an end to the ICE surge that is underway in Minnesota.

In its argument, the state cites ""harm"" brought by the surge, including the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent a week ago, among other conflicts.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution.

Dig deeper:

The lawsuit argues that the recent surge of federal law enforcement officers that has brought at least 2,100 ICE officers and Homeland Security investigators into the state is ""unconstitutional and unlawful.""

It seeks to end the surge, while also blocking the Trump administration from moving forward any similar actions in Minnesota in the future.

With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 came economic growth.","On 14 January, the Trump administration announced a stop on issuing immigrant visas for applicants from 75 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as 10 countries from eastern Europe. The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by claiming that immigrants from these countries are at “high risk” of reliance on welfare and becoming a “public charge”.

As an immigration scholar, I was immediately struck by the falsehood of this economic justification. The vast majority of immigrants have been legally disqualified from cash welfare since 1996. Those who do qualify for benefits like Snap and Medicaid use them at much lower rates than non-immigrants. Through their taxes, immigrants are net contributors – especially undocumented immigrants who are excluded from federal benefits.

I also noted a pattern uniting the countries on the list: nearly all were also restricted through the 1924 Immigration Act’s racial quotas.

Abolished in 1965, due to the civil-rights movement’s demands for equality of all races under the law, racial quotas were at the heart of the 1924 Immigration Act, also called the Johnson-Reed Act, which for four decades restricted immigration to the United States on the basis of nation of origin.

Albert Johnson, its lead author, was a representative from Washington, and a eugenicist, who believed that “our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood”. Johnson, who boasted about participating in Ku Klux Klan violence against south Asians, wrote the Immigration Act to exclude anyone who was not a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number. It used the 1890 census to determine annual quotas for who could come from where, allocating nearly nine out of 10 slots to people from northern and western Europe, with the remaining largely set aside for people from southern and eastern Europe. Asians were totally barred, save for a few slots for people from the Levant, and total African admissions were capped at 1,200 people each year.

The Immigration Act also established the category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements. An accompanying act later that year allocated funds for the first border patrol.

Trump’s rhetoric almost a century later bears a jarring resemblance to Johnson’s. The president has also claimed that immigrants are “poisoning the nation’s blood.” He too has said that he prefers the “nice people” of Sweden, Norway and Denmark to people from “filthy, dirty, disgusting” countries like Somalia.

The Johnson and Trump policies also developed in similar ways. Just as this administration is evoking the specter of immigrants becoming a “public charge”, and instructing consular officers to test immigrant’s English through an interview, Johnson ushered through a bill in 1917, as a precursor to the 1924 Immigration Act, that excluded anyone who was a “public charge” and required a literacy test for immigrants. Both sets of policies demanded more stringent testing on immigrant health – Johnson was a proponent of sterilizing the mentally disabled.

At the time, the Johnson-Reed Act was very popular. It passed with over 80% support in both houses of Congress. And it was signed into law by Calvin Coolidge, who believed that “America must be kept American”, echoing the mantra of the Ku Klux Klan, which was a proponent of the law.

The Immigration Act achieved its goals of keeping America white and stopping migration. In the coming four decades, immigration to the United States would come to a screeching halt, dropping from 13% foreign-born in the 1920s to less than 5% in 1970. That year, the US was 87.5% white.

By contrast, today 15% of people in the US are foreign-born, and the country is 57.8% white. The concern that the United States could become majority non-white as of 2045 is likely a driving force for Project 2025’s mass deportation vision that Trump is enacting today.

Then, like now, refugees were also denied. In one harrowing example, in 1939, more than 900 Jewish passengers aboard the SS St Louis were forced to return to Europe, almost a quarter of whom later died in Nazi concentration camps. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were fully revealed, it was not until 1948 that the United States took in Jewish refugees, and even then, just 200,000 people. Signing that bill into law, Harry Truman described himself as reluctant, denouncing the bill’s restrictions as antisemitic and xenophobic.

It is no surprise then that Adolf Hitler, who wrote about the Johnson-Reed Act in Mein Kampf, praised it, writing that the US was the “one state” that “simply excludes the immigration of certain races”.

A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s mass deportation policy as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser, has praised Coolidge and the four decades of low immigration to the United States.

With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 came economic growth. New arrivals breathed life into US industry at all levels, injecting trillions of dollars into the economy, and filling key labor shortages. Yet, as the number of non-white people increased, pathways to admissions narrowed. The United States spent three times as much on the detention of immigrant detention as adjudicating immigrants’ claims. The idea that Trump is closing an open border belies the fact that $410bn has been spent on border securitization alone in the last two decades.

None of these facts matter. The purpose of this immigration ban, like the other travel bans this administration has passed, has nothing to do with economics. Just as the mass deportation agenda has nothing to do with immigrant criminality – which has long been a myth. The purpose of this latest immigration ban is to whiten the nation, period, just as was the purpose of the ban a century prior. This administration has said and has shown time and time again that there is “no price tag” on accomplishing this goal.

But just as this latest immigration ban has precedent in US history, so too does the resistance to it. We can learn from the civil rights movement, from the Black led multiracial coalition that insisted that the rights of all people of color were deeply connected, that they needed to be treated equally under the law. We can recognize too that the work of that movement continues, that the white supremacy it fought is enduring, and that we need to organize and protest, and fight for a system that once and for all refuses enduring racist reasoning, and recognizes the humanity of all.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922364ae9aa59ffc69c7c349cf9c2083fd680312/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=64ea0438b87986d4491a0cbca5176d27",N,,2026-01-17 10:58:47.357403

ICE agents would flood Portland and Lewiston as soon as Tuesday to conduct “forceful entry” operations, according to one tip sent to the Portland Press Herald that cited internal communications in the state Department of Health and Human Services. Our cities were potentially about to become the next Minneapolis, or Chicago.

The suggested raids have not yet materialized, but Democratic leaders such as Gov. Janet Mills, Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline began issuing statements Wednesday on how they were preparing for operations to begin in the near future. They urged residents to know their rights and asked protesters to remain peaceful.

No one appeared to know the exact origin of the tips, with Mills saying she made an unsuccessful attempt to confirm any plans with federal officials and Dion saying he spoke to someone at the “congressional level” who indicated ICE is planning to send agents to Portland. The federal government has not shared more details.

But all week, Maine was stuck in a state of fear and paranoia. Neighbors in online groups discussed potential sightings of ICE agents at apartment complexes in the Portland area and an arrest of an immigrant in Biddeford. A caller contacted the Press Herald newsroom on Thursday to claim ICE agents were in Portland at Waynflete School and Reiche Elementary School, but that also turned out to not be the case — at least not that our reporters on the scene could see.

The uncertainty coincided with Trump threatening to send the military to quash anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis after a federal agent killed a woman there last week.

It also came as the Trump administration shared its intent to end the Temporary Protected Status humanitarian program for Somali immigrants in the U.S. amid fraud investigations tied to Somalis in Minnesota and Maine.

The unease felt by immigrant communities that have settled in Maine’s two largest cities has manifested itself in different ways.

A parent at Reiche Community School in Portland’s West End shared how she drove her neighbors’ kids to school Monday morning because their parents, who speak Spanish, were scared to stand with their children at the bus stop or walk them to class. A Lewiston property manager told the Bangor Daily News how undocumented parents are receiving forms to designate temporary guardians for their kids in case they are arrested.

Restaurants and companies from Portland to Bath described making sure employees with immigrant backgrounds had their legal paperwork in order. A volunteer with the Maine ICE Watch Hotline said it has seen a surge in calls over the past week.

The presence of ICE in Maine is not new, but what was different about the latest reports is how the looming surge in Portland or Lewiston would purportedly be larger than past ones in the state. ICE reported a spike in Maine apprehensions in the past year, with 230 people detained between January and mid-October, per the Deportation Data Project.

The data indicated 20% of those ICE detainees in Maine had a criminal conviction and 35% had no criminal record, while 43% had pending criminal charges.

With the next steps uncertain and rumors continuing to circulate, immigrants and advocates in Maine described taking no chances as they prepared for ICE encounters.

Ifraax Saciid-Ciise, founder of IFKA Community Services, a Lewiston-based organization that supports immigrant women, was among those who said immigrants and U.S.-born citizens alike are afraid the color of their skin, their accents and their choice to wear hijabs could make them targets of ICE agents.

“I’ve spoken to a lot of public officials, and they are saying there is not much they can do to impede ICE, that they have the right to be here and follow their federal orders,” Saciid-Ciise said. “It feels like a total lack of support.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/POY-PROTESTS_12.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-17 13:57:49.513660

One district court held that the law used to deport Khalil is likely unconstitutionally vague.","The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Thursday reversed a district court’s decision that released Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention.

The court held that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) stripped the US District for the District of New Jersey of subject-matter jurisdiction because the INA requires deportation challenges be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court, not a district court.

The Third Circuit held that the statute serves to provide “one bite at the apple” and that Khalil needed to first exhaust his direct appeal before seeking habeas relief. The court stated:

Each of the legal questions Khalil raises in his petition can be decided later, on a [petition for review]. He challenges a broad array of alleged governmental misconduct under the First and Fifth Amendments, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) … addressing any of those claims would require deciding whether removing Khalil would be unlawful—the very issue decided through the [petition for review] process. To be sure, the immigration judge’s order of removal is not yet final; the Board has not affirmed her ruling and has held the parties’ briefing deadlines in abeyance pending this opinion. But if the Board ultimately affirms, Khalil can get meaningful review.

In other words, because Khalil is raising legal questions that a petition for review court can meaningfully review later on, the INA bars him from attacking his removal and detention in a habeas petition. The court ultimately did not decide any of the key constitutional or statutory issues presented in Khalil’s case, specifically whether his removal over campus activism would be unconstitutional.

Mahmoud Khalil, an Algerian-Syrian-born US permanent resident and activist, has been targeted by Donald Trump’s administration for his alleged affiliations with Hamas and anti-semitism. One district court held that the law used to deport Khalil is likely unconstitutionally vague.

Lawmakers are working to complete the passage of all 12 annual spending bills for fiscal year (FY) 2026.

On Thursday, the Senate sent three funding bills to the president – Commerce-Justice-Science, Interior-Environment, and Energy-Water – after approving the package by a broadly bipartisan 82-15 vote. That brings the total to six of the 12 bills that have now cleared both chambers.

The Agriculture, Military Construction-VA, and Legislative Branch measures became law late last year as part of the package that ended the government shutdown.

Congress has about two weeks to pass the remaining bills covering Financial Services, National Security-State, Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, Transportation-HUD, and Homeland Security.

However, the path to full funding remains uncertain as partisan tensions flare over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, particularly involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an issue expected to require further negotiations.

Earlier this week, the House approved the National Security-State and Financial Services appropriations bill by a 341-79 vote.

Tech details in the funding package

The $180 billion funding package includes $5 million for the Technology Modernization Fund, to remain available until expended. The provision comes after the fund expired last month for the first time since its creation in 2017, freezing nearly $200 million for federal technology projects.

Lawmakers also agreed to $1.4 million for the General Services Administration’s Office of Technology Policy and Initiatives.

The agreement also largely rejects major spending cuts proposed in the White House’s FY 2026 budget request, instead making modest reductions across multiple agencies.

The package trims funding for the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and NASA. NSF would see nearly a 4% reduction, rejecting a proposed cut of about 57%. NASA would receive about $24.43 billion, a nearly 2% decrease from current spending, while lawmakers rejected proposals to cut its science budget by nearly half and terminate dozens of missions.

The Energy Department’s Office of Science would receive a $160 million increase, about 2%, instead of a more than $1 billion reduction proposed by the administration. Funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology would rise to roughly $1.8 billion, including $55 million for artificial intelligence research and expanded work on AI standards, quantum information science, and cybersecurity.

The legislation also limits unilateral workforce and organizational changes by federal agencies. It would bar agencies from reprogramming funds to create or eliminate programs, relocate offices, or reduce staffing or funding for a program by more than 5% without congressional approval.",https://meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1783076981-min.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:57:44.270985

Lunas Campos' death is the second migrant death at Camp East Montana.","Rochester, N.Y. (WHAM) — The death of a Henrietta man in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody is likely to be investigated as a homicide, according to a Washington Post report.

Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died Jan. 3 at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility just outside El Paso, Texas.

ICE said Lunas Campos ""became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm"" earlier that day and placed in segregation.

While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance. Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services. Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS.

The Washington Post reported an El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner employee said Lunas Campos' death is likely to be classified as a homicide, pending the results of a toxicology report.

In a recording Lunas Campos’s daughter shared with The Post, the employee said a doctor “is listing the preliminary cause of death as asphyxia due to neck and chest compression,” which means Lunas Campos did not get enough oxygen because of pressure on his neck and chest. A fellow detainee says he witnessed Lunas Campos being choked to death by guards at an ICE detention center in Texas on Jan. 3.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson provided a statement to 13WHAM Friday, saying Lunas Campos attempted to take his own life, and security staff intervened to save him.

Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life. During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness. Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene.

ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody. This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming. ICE investigates the circumstances of all deaths in custody.

ICE said Lunas Campos, a Cuban citizen, entered the U.S. in 1996 and was convicted of several crimes between 1998 and 2009. The list includes a 2003 conviction in Rochester for sexual contact with a child under age 11 that led to a one-year jail sentence and required him to register as a sex offender.

Lunas Campos’ adult daughter told the Associated Press the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.

“My father was not a child molester,” Kary Lunas, 25, told the AP. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”

AP says Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.

Immigration authorities arrested Lunas Campos during a planned enforcement operation in Rochester July 14, according to ICE, before he was transferred Sept. 6 to Camp East Montana and remained in custody pending removal proceedings.

An immigration judge ordered Lunas Campos to be removed from the U.S. in 2005, according to ICE, but he wasn't removed because the government couldn't obtain travel documents.

Jeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, told AP the day after he died, the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened. Pagan-Lopez, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results.

Pagan-Lopez said she was also told the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated. Pagan-Lopez declined and told 13WHAM on Friday that she is seeking help from family and friends to raise money to ship his body home.

Lunas Campos' death is the second migrant death at Camp East Montana.

Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have impeded federal immigration enforcement through public statements they have made, two people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The investigation, which both Walz and Frey said was a bullying tactic meant to threaten political opposition, focused on potential violation of a conspiracy statute, the people said.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a pending investigation by name.

CBS News first reported the investigation.

The investigation comes during a weekslong immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and St. Paul that the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest recent immigration enforcement operation, resulting in more than 2,500 arrests.

The operation has become more confrontational since the fatal shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7, with agents pulling people from cars and homes and frequently being confronted by angry bystanders demanding they leave. State and local officials have repeatedly told protesters to remain peaceful.

In response to reports of the investigation, Walz said in a statement: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”

U.S. senators Kelly, from Arizona, and Slotkin, from Michigan, are under investigation from the President Donald Trump administration after appearing with other Democratic lawmakers in a video urging members of the military to resist “illegal orders.” The administration has also launched a criminal investigation of Powell, a first for a sitting federal reserve chair.

Walz’s office said it has not received any notice of an investigation.

Frey described the investigation as an attempt to intimidate him for “standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets.”

The U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis did not immediately comment.

In a post on the social media platform X following reports of the investigation, Attorney General Pam Bondi said: “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.” She did not specifically mention the investigation.

State calls for peaceful protests

With more protests expected in the Twin Cities this weekend, state authorities urged demonstrators to avoid confrontation.

“While peaceful expression is protected, any actions that harm people, destroy property or jeopardize public safety will not be tolerated,” said Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

His comments came after Trump backed off a bit from his threat a day earlier to invoke an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, to send troops to suppress demonstrations.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters outside the White House.

A U.S. judge in Minnesota ruled on Friday that the federal officers working in the Minneapolis-area enforcement operation can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who aren’t obstructing authorities, including when they’re observing agents.

The case was filed before Good’s shooting on behalf of six Minnesota activists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota.

Government attorneys had argued that the officers have been acting within their legal authority to enforce immigration laws and protect themselves. But the ACLU has said government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

Detention whiplash

A Liberian man who has been shuttled in and out of custody since immigration agents broke down his door with a battering ram was released again Friday, hours after a routine check-in with authorities led to his second arrest.

The dramatic initial arrest of Garrison Gibson last weekend was captured on video. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled the arrest unlawful Thursday and freed him, but Gibson was detained again Friday when he appeared at an immigration office.

A few hours later, Gibson was free again, attorney Marc Prokosch said.

Gibson, 37, who fled the civil war in his West African home country as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, Prokosch said, and complied with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.

In his Thursday order, the judge agreed that officials violated regulations by not giving Gibson enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked. Prokosch said he was told by ICE that they are “now going through their proper channels” to revoke the order.

911 caller: Good was shot ‘point blank’

Minneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls related to the fatal shooting of Good. Firefighters found what appeared to be two gunshot wounds in her right chest, one in her left forearm and a possible gunshot wound on the left side of her head, records show.

“They shot her, like, cause she wouldn’t open her car door,” a caller said. “Point blank range in her car.”

Good, 37, was at the wheel of her Honda Pilot, which was partially blocking a street. Video showed an officer approached the SUV, demanded that she open the door and grabbed the handle.

Good began to pull forward and turned the vehicle’s wheel to the right. Another ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, pulled his gun and fired at close range, jumping back as the SUV moved past him. DHS claims the agent shot Good in self-defense.

NO WORK, SCHOOL, SHOPPING Although unions have endorsed the calls for Minnesotans to refuse work, school, and shopping on January 23, no union has agreed to strike yet.
To me, at a certain point, a mass mobilization becomes something qualitatively new.” History shows how mass protests can grow into mass strikes.","Minnesota appears to be in gear for a mass uprising. Unions, community organizations, faith leaders, and small businesses there are calling for a statewide day of “no work (except for emergency services), no school, and no shopping” on January 23.

Festering grievances swelled into a national outcry on January 7, after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed poet and mother of three Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis while she and her wife were observing federal agents swarming her neighborhood.

A week later, another federal agent shot a Latino immigrant from Venezuela in the leg. ICE agents have sprayed chemical agents in protesters’ eyes. On Wednesday night, they detonated a tear gas canister underneath the car of a family just trying to get home from basketball practice; the baby, strapped in his car seat, was knocked unconscious.

Trump’s regime has ramped up racist attacks targeting Somali and Latino communities —battering down doors, raiding small businesses and forcing them to shutter, trailing school buses, dropping tear gas outside schools, circling hospitals. He has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to Minneapolis.

Under siege, Minnesotans are leaning on organizations at work and in their neighborhoods to end the terror.

“We are not going to shop. We are not going to work. We are not going to school on Friday, January 23. For some people they call that a strike,” said JaNaé Bates Imari of Camphor Memorial United Methodist Church at a press conference on Tuesday. “For many of us, this is our right to refusal until something changes.”

UNIONS STEP UP

Among the unions endorsing the call are Service Employees Local 26, UNITE HERE Local 17, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 13, Communications Workers Local 7250, the St. Paul Federation of Educators Local 28, Minneapolis Federation of Educators (AFT Local 59), the Transit Union (ATU) Local 1005, the Committee of Interns and Residents (SEIU), and the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.

“Our labor federations are encouraging everyone to participate on January 23rd,” said Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minneapolis federation. “It’s time for every single Minnesotan who loves this state and the notion of truth and freedom to raise their voices and deepen their solidarity for our neighbors and co-workers living under this federal occupation.”

Other endorsers include Faith in Minnesota, Tending the Soil, United Renters for Justice, Unidos Minnesota, Communities Against Police Brutality, Indivisible Twin Cities, Women’s March Minnesota, the worker center Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en la Lucha, and Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. In all, 90 organizations, big and small, have endorsed the call.

Under the banner “ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom,” they are calling for ICE to leave the state, for the officer who killed Good to be held legally accountable, for no additional federal funding for ICE, and for businesses to sever any economic ties with the federal agency.

Three thousand ICE agents have swarmed the Minneapolis area in recent weeks, and they’ve become more aggressive, emboldened by the Trump administration’s offer of immunity.

Workers are facing them on the job. Letter carriers organized a rally in December to kick ICE agents off two postal parking lots in South Minneapolis. ATU Metro Transit workers are calling on ICE to stop interfering with bus operations after a violent arrest at a bus stop on January 10 and the detention of a Somali-American Metro Transit worker last December.

“They’re walking onto Metro Transit buses,” said bus driver Ryan Timlin, a steward in ATU Local 1005. “It’s getting to knocking down doors. They’re just doing whatever they can to haul people off. They call this a democratic society here in the United States—it doesn’t feel like it in Minneapolis. It’s a nightmare. The garage I work at in South Minneapolis has a massive East African population. Our co-workers are walking around with passports, especially the Somali community, which Trump is really going after. They’re U.S. citizens!”

He and his co-workers got the local to pass a resolution saying members should not cooperate with ICE—for instance by letting them onto trains and buses—and establishing a rapid-response network. At a January 14 press conference, Local 1005 President David Stiggers called ICE’s repression “a throwback to the darkest times of human history, 1940s Germany.”

ICE OUT OF MN

Nat Anderson-Lippert, organizing director for the Minneapolis Federation of Educators, says the Minneapolis teachers have drawn inspiration from the Chicago Teachers Union’s sanctuary schools model, which has brought parents and teachers together to deepen school-community organizing. “The level of infrastructure and organizing is so impressive and humbling,” he said.

“The attack on immigrants is not new, but the intensity we are seeing is just extreme, and so many more people are stepping up right now to meet the moment,” said Jason Rodney, an assistant special education teacher at Anishinabe Academy in Minneapolis Public Schools.

In last November’s contract fight, MFE won stronger language from the district to refuse ICE on school grounds unless the agent can show a judicial warrant, including data privacy protections and mental health support for staff. School workers’ jobs are also protected should they be detained or lose their legal status, putting them on the job recall list.

The organizing includes mutual aid, which can mean grocery runs, rent support, and setting up carpools. The union also won the right for families scared for their safety to do virtual learning, and the school has hosted know-your-rights trainings.

Much of it boils down to a foundation of trust built over time, including during the George Floyd uprising. “More people know their neighbors since 2020 than they did before that, and that has absolutely helped us respond more quickly, building neighborhood response networks and mutual aid support right on our blocks,” Rodney said.

Under the pressures of the moment, he said the union has tried to be a steadying force. “We’re in a hundred Signal loops and it can get draining to follow things we aren’t going to take action on,” he said. So teachers are talking to their co-workers and deciding where to focus. “This is a crisis,” he said, but “I think we’re going to leave this stronger. We’re going to get ICE out.”

Trump has used a fraud scandal as a pretext to racially profile Somali U.S. citizens and threaten to denaturalize them. But the repression has sparked brave defiance in some Somali-American workers, like Uber driver Ahmed Bin Hassan, who defied federal agents at an airport parking lot in a video that circulated on social media. “They couldn’t hear my voice when they knocked on my window, but they could see my color,” Bin Hassan told The Intercept. “I knew if these people are going to take me out here today, it’s going to happen. So I’m just going to be me.”

A DECADE OF ORGANIZING

The momentum is growing from mass protests, like the one in downtown Minneapolis on January 10 that drew 10,000. But the bold demands also build on at least a decade of organizing.

In 2020, half a million Americans turned out to Black Lives Matter protests for racial justice following the murder of George Floyd, not far from where ICE killed Renee Good.

In 2022, MFE struck to raise wages for the lowest-paid educators, education support professionals, who were mostly people of color, while the higher-paid teachers were mostly white. The BLM uprising had helped build solidarity between these groups and highlight the racial justice dimension of their contract fight.

It also seeded networks of resistance, which have been reactivated now as Roosevelt High School has been engulfed in a warzone; ICE agents have gassed students and teachers, and the school has emerged as a key site of student walkouts. Marcia Howard, now president of MFE, taught English at Roosevelt when Floyd was killed feet away from her front door. She took a leave of absence to lead in that struggle, turning George Floyd Square into a memorial and protest hub.

CWA Local 7250 President Kieran Knutson says the police murders of Jamar Clark in North Minneapolis and Philando Castile in a suburb of St. Paul also fueled resistance networks and raised consciousness. Now Trump’s attacks on immigrants have opened up tough conversations inside his local.

“If we’re going to discuss something that’s controversial, we’re going to put it all on the table,” said Knutson. We’re gonna have a discussion about it at the membership level, and we’re going to move forward with what the majority believes is right.”

The conversations reflect experiences that members are having in their own neighborhoods. When Knutson was handing out flyers about ICE, two union women told him they were already part of the immigrant defense network, and showed him their ICE alert whistles.

“We fight like hell on all issues of wages, benefits, and discipline,” said Knutson. “And that gives us some credibility to talk about things more broadly. So we talk about the philosophy that an injury to one is an injury to all. I tell people that’s my religion.”

Last December, ICE abducted two CWA Local 7304 members from Laos at the electric-bus manufacturer New Flyer in St. Cloud, Minnesota. They had worked at New Flyer for more than 20 years.

GROUNDWORK FOR DISRUPTION

Since 2011, a constellation of forces in Minnesota has been building power by bringing together workers, tenants, and community members to contest for power and transform the economy state-wide.

They’ve organized joint weeks of action, strategized together about how their corporate foes are linked, and begun lining up contract expirations. All this helps lay the groundwork for what may be possible next week.

“Over the last two decades in Minnesota, our labor, faith and community groups have built relationships that allowed us to take on more strategic campaigns together,” said SEIU Local 26 President Greg Nammacher. “We’ve taken on the corporations who run our state to address the racial and economic inequalities they have caused, and won big things.

“Now our communities are now under attack directly from the federal government. And we are going to do everything in our power to defend the workers and people who honor that call.”

GET ON OFFENSE

To go on offense, you also need backup. The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation is backing an eviction moratorium, because many workers are afraid to report to work lest they risk being kidnapped by ICE.

“We don’t need to be adding to our houseless population,” said Stacie Balkaran, a spokesperson for the federation. Through its nonprofit arm Working Partnerships, the federation has also funded a network of mutual aid groups. These networks have helped keep people fed after federal attacks to strip the state of SNAP funding, and they are coordinating aid for groceries and rides to and from work.

The federation has established a legal fund to support illegally detained workers, aiming to raise $150,000. (You can donate here.) According to Balkaran, these funds will go to any worker regardless of whether they are in a union or not.

In preparation for the January 23 day of action, the Minnesota AFL-CIO will dispatch union peacekeepers, “so that we can actually keep us safe… and know that they are safe in exercising their First Amendment rights,” said Balkaran.

NO WORK, SCHOOL, SHOPPING

Although unions have endorsed the calls for Minnesotans to refuse work, school, and shopping on January 23, no union has agreed to strike yet.

“We have not voted on a strike, but our union is calling on people to support this call,” said Knutson. “People can say, ‘This is not a real general strike.’ This is a mass mobilization. To me, at a certain point, a mass mobilization becomes something qualitatively new.”

History shows how mass protests can grow into mass strikes. The 1934 San Francisco general strike began after longshore workers and their supporters shut down the city’s commercial district in a mass funeral procession, following the killing of two strikers and beatings of thousands.

“The funeral march made the general strike, until then at best a threat, all but inevitable,” writes historian Nelson Lichtenstein in his forthcoming book Why Labor Unions Matter, because seeing 40,000 longshore workers and their supporters bring the city’s commercial district to a halt gave the city’s working class a surge of confidence in its own power. Six days later, with backing from the San Francisco labor council, 150,000 workers stopped working.

Unions can advance democracy against authoritarian governments, Lichtenstein writes, but to do so, the unions “have to transcend themselves,” going beyond representing just members to become social movements that can reach for “a vast new set of energies and aspirations.”

That moment may have arrived. “Our actions now will determine what kind of country we will have for a generation,” said Nammacher of SEIU Local 26.

Could the mobilization expand beyond Minnesota soon? “May Day Strong stands firmly in support of our affiliates in Minneapolis who are doing tremendous organizing to stand up a day of no school, no work, and no shopping next Friday,” said Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jackson Potter, speaking for a national coalition of unions and community groups that has been organizing days of action nationwide. “The way things are going, we will have no choice but to emulate this fearless example as a nation on May 1st.”",https://labornotes.org/sites/default/files/main/articles/image%20%2837%29.png,N,,2026-01-17 10:59:01.497482

Although officials in Portland and Lewiston have warned that enforcement could ramp up as early as next week, they have not disclosed the source of that information.

Despite the lack of public confirmation, local leaders said they believe the threat is real enough to begin preparing.

Recent national events have raised tensions, particularly in light of a deadly ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that led to mass protests and political fallout. President Trump’s response included threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to send federal troops to the city. Against this backdrop, Maine leaders say they want to ensure the public is informed and protected.

Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris had planned to join Portland Mayor Mark Dion for a press conference on Friday to address the issue, but the event was canceled due to security concerns.

In an interview with NEWS CENTER Maine, Sartoris emphasized the importance of reminding everyone—including federal agents—that they are not above state law.

""It's certainly possible that if you commit a criminal act in Maine and we have adequate evidence, you could be charged with that crime in a couple of years. It could absolutely be that the statute of limitations carries you past the length of time of this administration.""

While she says her office would be prepared to file charges if laws are broken, Sartoris clarified that her office cannot conduct investigations directly. She urged the public not to send potential evidence to the district attorney’s office, stressing that proper investigative channels must go through law enforcement.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce echoed that message, stating his department is ready to investigate any wrongdoing—whether by ICE agents or by members of the public.

""We’re held to a standard as law enforcement,"" Joyce said. ""If we see things that don't look good... we take information down on what's going on, whether we have body camera footage, and we look at potential charges on whether or not ICE was doing the right thing.""

However, Joyce also stressed that local law enforcement has limited authority when it comes to federal agents, particularly in the midst of active enforcement operations.

If officers are called to a scene where ICE is present, their role would likely focus on ensuring that any protests or public responses remain peaceful and safe. They do not have jurisdiction over ICE operations, and Joyce cautioned people not to interfere.

Good was taking part in one of numerous neighborhood patrols organised by local activists to track and monitor ICE activities.

On Friday, US District Judge Kate Menendez’s court injunction barred federal ​agents from retaliating against individuals engaged in peaceful, unobstructive protest ‍activity.

Officers were explicitly prohibited from arresting or detaining people protesting peacefully or engaged in orderly observations, if there was no reasonable suspicion that they had committed a crime ‍or were ⁠interfering with law enforcement.

The ruling also bans federal agents from using pepper spray, tear gas or other crowd-control munitions against peaceful demonstrators or bystanders observing and recording the immigration enforcement operations.

The US ‌Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was given 72 hours to bring its operation in Minneapolis into compliance.

The court ruling hands a victory to activists in Minneapolis, the state’s most populous ⁠city, two weeks after the Trump administration announced the deployment of 2,000 immigration agents to ​the area.

Their numbers have since grown to nearly 3,000, dwarfing the ranks of the local police. The DHS calls it the largest operation of its kind in the country’s history.

Crowds of protesters across Minneapolis have clashed with the immigration officers, opposing their efforts to target undocumented migrants, with some officers responding with violence.

Amid the escalating dispute between Trump and local state and city leaders, the president threatened on Thursday to invoke the Insurrection Act, allowing him to deploy the military to police the protests.

“If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the move.

The Insurrection Act allows a president to sidestep the 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act, which removes the military from regular civil law enforcement, to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence” and deploy soldiers on US soil “as he considers necessary”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016081467327-1768633254.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-17 07:57:04.230442

Katie Glueck: Hi guys!
Katie Glueck: I’ve definitely heard from some moderates who are worried that “Abolish ICE” becomes the next “Defund the Police” and ends up backfiring.
Lisa, immigration has historically been a challenging issue for Democrats to navigate.
Katie Glueck: Are there places either of you are watching where this feels especially urgent electorally?","It’s hard to look away from the scenes in Minneapolis. A 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. A young man shouting “I’m a U.S. citizen!” as federal agents hauled him away. Protests this week after a federal agent shot and injured someone.

As tensions flare in the city, I wanted to try to make sense of the political implications — with the caveats that this is a rapidly evolving situation, and that the Trump administration and local officials are in dispute over what happened in the chaotic moments before Good was shot.

So I turned to my friends and colleagues Jenny Medina and Lisa Lerer for a Slack conversation on Friday morning about ICE, immigration politics and how both could play a role in the midterm elections. Here’s what we discussed, edited and condensed for clarity.

Katie Glueck: Hi guys! Jenny, you had a great story this week looking at how Democrats are grappling with the way to talk about ICE raids. Tell us a little about the competing pressures for Democrats.

Jennifer Medina: The vast majority of Democrats — both elected leaders and voters — believe that the Trump administration is being far too aggressive with its immigration enforcement tactics. The question for Democrats is what to do, and how to talk about it.

Some think the only way to get lasting change is by starting over and eliminating the agency, hence the renewed “Abolish ICE” calls. But plenty of others worry that embracing that message could have devastating consequences, politically and practically.

Katie Glueck: I’ve definitely heard from some moderates who are worried that “Abolish ICE” becomes the next “Defund the Police” and ends up backfiring. In Minnesota, officials are also urging protesters to demonstrate peacefully, warning that any other approach would play into President Trump’s hands.

Lisa, immigration has historically been a challenging issue for Democrats to navigate. You and I spent some time yesterday with Democratic House candidates who are running in battleground districts. What were your impressions of how they’re thinking about this?

Lisa Lerer: Democrats in purple districts are not embracing full-throated calls to eliminate ICE. Instead, they are first saying that the country needs a “secure” border. And then, they are quickly pivoting to attacking ICE’s aggressive tactics, arguing that this approach makes cities less safe. But, honestly, how intense of an issue this is electorally depends a bit on where you are running.

Katie Glueck: Are there places either of you are watching where this feels especially urgent electorally?

Lisa Lerer: Well, most of the highest-profile efforts have been focused on blue cities — Chicago, Minneapolis, Charlotte and the Research Triangle in North Carolina, and Los Angeles — so any nearby suburban swing seats for the House are certainly places where this issue could be more resonant.

Jennifer Medina: There are several competitive House districts in the Southwest that have a large number of Hispanic voters and have swung toward Trump in recent presidential elections. How those voters react to the second Trump administration could decide control of the House.

Katie Glueck: This issue could also factor into races for Senate and governor, right?

Jennifer Medina: Definitely — I’m especially curious how this all plays out in North Carolina and Georgia.

Lisa Lerer: I do wonder if the Minnesota unrest will end up being a turning point in how this issue is playing politically. I was struck by a national Quinnipiac poll this week showing that 82 percent of voters had seen video of Good being shot by the agent. And, Katie, some of the Democratic candidates we talked to this week — ones in areas that haven’t had the same level of immigration enforcement — told us they are starting to get asked about ICE for the first time.

America is definitely paying attention to this issue now.

Katie Glueck: Pat Ryan, a House Democrat in New York, told me recently that at least some Trump voters in his district thought that ICE was overreaching, AND that their affordability concerns weren’t being met.

In 2024, Republicans were effective in arguing that Democrats were more focused on culture wars than on Americans’ pocketbooks. I wonder if some Democrats try the reverse of that argument and suggest that Republicans are more focused on violent crackdowns than on affordability.

Jennifer Medina: I spoke to several Democrats this week who said that should be their precise strategy — that prices keep going up while billions of dollars are being spent on harsh immigration enforcement tactics.

Katie Glueck: Jenny, you’ve written extensively about Hispanic voters. Do we know whether some who voted for Trump in 2024 are swinging back to the Democrats now, or is it too early to say?

Jennifer Medina: Several polls suggest that some Hispanic Trump voters are having buyer’s remorse and are particularly frustrated about both the economy and deportation operations. But it isn’t necessarily the case that those voters will turn toward Democrats, particularly in the midterms. Many of those voters chose Trump out of frustration and could simply sit this year out.

Katie Glueck: How are Republicans thinking about the politics of this issue? I saw Joe Rogan, the influential right-leaning podcaster, suggesting that some of the tactics were reminiscent of the Gestapo.

Lisa Lerer: There is uneasiness in some quarters. Strategists and candidates were already bracing for a tough midterm election. A sense of chaos in the country is never good for the party in power. There’s plenty of polling showing that independents disapprove of ICE tactics.

While polling indicates that Republicans are largely sticking with Trump, some of those voters have a history of not showing up when he’s not on the ballot. That makes winning over self-described independents even more important in those purple areas.

Jennifer Medina: Some Republicans are taking a page from the White House and projecting utter confidence. But I’ve also heard from Republicans like Representative Maria Elvira Salazar, who represents Miami and is deeply concerned that her party is going far beyond what public sentiment supports. She is worried the party will erase the gains it has made with Hispanic voters.

Katie Glueck: Yes, I was struck by what Salazar said in your article — “I don’t want the Hispanic community, my community, to believe or to think that the G.O.P. doesn’t love them.” Representative Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat, recently told me that part of her party’s problem in 2024 was that some voters simply thought Democrats didn’t like them.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/newsletter-1-hmjf/newsletter-1-hmjf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:02.303320

The report, obtained by Fox News Digital, included an incident report from the Minneapolis Fire and Police departments, 911 call transcripts, and witness reports.

The documents were released late Thursday.

The 911 call transcripts consisted of 17 pages of calls made out of the area in the moments after Good was shot and offered a profane, splintered glimpse into eyewitness accounts.

Calls began shortly after 9:38 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 7, and according to the reports, there were ""[multiple] voices yelling [and] screaming in the background.""

The operator questioned the caller if she was near Good, and she detailed that she was across the street and said ICE made her move away from the incident.

Another caller described their account of the moment agents shot at Good's vehicle.

""They just shot a lady. Point-blank range in her car,"" described the caller. ""They shot her, like, [be]cause she wouldn’t open her car door.""

The same caller mentioned someone on scene was recording a video and captured the moment Good was shot. In the hours after the shooting, multiple videos of the incident began circulating online.

Another caller in the transcript appeared to be calling on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The caller requested emergency assistance and relaying messages from agents on the scene, according to the transcript.

The caller reported, ""officers stuck in a vehicle,"" ""agitators on scene,"" and ""shots fired by our locals."" The operator asked for a description of the shooter and the caller replied, ""I don’t have any of that stuff, we’re just trying to get assistance.""

According to the police report, the fire department began giving ""medical aid"" at 9:45 a.m. after arriving on scene. The report also detailed a crowd was beginning to form in the area and requested ""crowd control and [the] area blocked off.""

At 9:50 a.m. the report indicates the crowd began to get hostile and at 9:52 a.m., more law enforcement was deployed to the scene to assist in crowd control efforts. The report also indicated later that ""agitators"" were cutting the crime scene tape established by law enforcement.

The agent who fired shots at Good was no longer on the scene as of 10:04 a.m. According to the report, the agent was transported to the ""federal building"" and police on scene requested that federal agents ""evacuate [the] scene when safe and as fast as [possible].""

At 11:01 a.m., the report indicates ICE agents were ""being surrounded"" and by 11:20 a.m. all agents left the scene.

The report also included mentions of flag burning and individuals who remained on scene that were reported throwing ice and snowballs at officers. The incident was closed at approximately 4:59 p.m. local time.

Good suffered four gunshot wounds, two to the chest, one on her left forearm and one on the left side of her head, according to the fire department report. Initial reports indicated Good had been shot three times.

DHS officials said the ICE officer fired in self-defense after Good used her Honda Pilot SUV in a way that posed a threat. DHS said video showed Good interfering with ICE officers by parking her vehicle in the roadway in an apparent attempt to block federal vehicles.

Lifesaving efforts continued at the scene, as she was being transported in an ambulance and then to Hennepin County Medical Center, according to previous Fox News Digital reporting. CPR was discontinued at 10:30 a.m.

But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office.
Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.
“I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.” “It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.
“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE agents,” Evans wrote.","Pennsylvania’s Democratic congressional delegation is in broad agreement that investigations and accountability are needed following the aggressive tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis and around the country.

But at this point, they haven’t landed on a united path forward.

Last week, Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly introduced three articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has defended the confrontational actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents. Kelly’s district includes a Chicago area that saw heavy ICE deployment in the fall and the articles she submitted cite obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust and self-dealing.

Other Democrats have called for investigations, and reforms, cutting funding for immigration enforcement, or abolishing ICE altogether.

But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office. Rep. Summer Lee, was among the first co-sponsors on the impeachment articles, while Chris Deluzio, who represents the broader Pittsburgh area, committed to adding his name to the co-sponsors, according to a spokesperson.

More than a week ago, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, as she tried to drive away from agents.

Pa. lawmaker moves to ban warrantless civil immigration arrests near state buildings

Footage of the shooting and the moments proceeding it went viral, stoking outrage and focusing the nation’s attention on the Trump administration’s militarized deportation campaign. But views among lawmakers split largely along partisan lines over whether the agent, who walked around the car to position himself in front of it when he fired the first shot, was acting in self-defense or using force unjustifiably. The second and third shots were fired from the side of the vehicle.

The Capital-Star asked all eight Democrats in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation how the House and Senate should respond to the shooting and the resulting unrest. Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.

While the Capital-Star’s questions included whether they supported impeachment, only Deluzio and Lee responded to the question directly.

“DHS agencies have demonstrated a pattern of violence against people with little to no accountability, emboldened by an administration that acts without impunity and adds fuel to the fire,” Lee said in a statement before articles of impeachment were introduced. “I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.”

“It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.

“Renee Good’s killing in Minneapolis is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to her grieving family and community,” Deluzio said in a statement.” From what I’ve seen so far, it is outrageous and disturbing that the Trump Administration immediately called this a ‘domestic terrorism’ incident. We need an independent investigation — and for the Congress to bring real oversight and accountability to ICE and Secretary Noem’s failed leadership.”

Congressional Republicans have largely rallied around the federal officers and DHS’ defense of the shooting.

The Capital-Star also reached out to the nine Republican members, but only one, Rep. Dan Meuser from Luzerne County, responded. A spokesperson sent the Capital-Star a Fox News interview from shortly after the killing of Good.

“I mean, law enforcement says, ‘Hey, stop, open up your door, let me see your ID,’ and then not only do you take off, but you go right at somebody as they jump out of the way of the car, basically you’re trying to run them over,” Meuser said. “That’s not what a normal person does to anyone, let alone law enforcement.”

President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that Good was trying to hit the officer with her vehicle, and he was acting in self defense. The administration has also called Good’s a “domestic terrorist.” Immediately following the shooting, Noem said that Good, “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.”

But Open Source Intelligence analysts at the New York Times, Bellingcat and the Washington Post all concluded that Good appeared to be driving away from the officer when he fired at her.

In the days following the shooting, protests against ICE erupted around the country, including in Pennsylvania. DHS ordered additional federal agents to Minneapolis, where daily life has been disrupted for residents, schools and businesses.

Where Pennsylvania’s other Democratic reps stand

Many of Deluzio and Lee’s Pennsylvania Democratic colleagues have stopped short of further action beyond calls for investigations and increased oversight. But, none ruled out support for impeachment.

Successfully removing Noem from office is unlikely. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House, which Democrats don’t hold by a 218-213 margin. A two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, which would require significant support from the Republican majority.

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-05), who has a background in immigration advocacy, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star. She was unequivocal in her condemnation of the shooting of Good, and ICE’s use of force across the country under the Trump administration.

“The whole enforcement push with armed and masked agents in American cities has been dangerous from the start,” Scanlon said. “There have been multiple incidents where these ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents have pulled their guns on people on American streets. There seem to be some serious questions about training, about the conditions in which they should be engaging with people, and huge questions about who it is they’re pursuing.”

Asked what she would support to rein in the agency, including impeachment, Scanlon said that effective measures would require a “Democratic majority.”

“I think we’re constantly struggling with the gap between what we should be doing and what we can be doing in the minority,” Scanlon said. The reality is Congress can’t act without a majority, and right now Congressional Republicans are too afraid of Donald Trump to do what the country needs.”

She called for investigations into the shooting and how ICE is spending its money.

Scanlon, Lee and Deluzio were also among the six of Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic representatives in the House who signed onto a letter to Noem calling for DHS “to take immediate steps to preserve evidence, bring in unbiased investigative partners like the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and ensure the officers involved comply fully with investigators.”

The letter also included specific questions for DHS, including what kind of training the officers involved in Good’s shooting received and what steps the agency is taking to prevent recurring violence against civilians.

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-02) was the lone Pennsylvania Democrat who did not sign the petition. He did, however, call for Noem’s resignation in a post on the social media platform X.

A spokesperson for Boyle did not respond to multiple questions from the Capital-Star about what steps the congressman would support to provide a check on immigration enforcement, including impeachment, but referred to a social media post he made.

“Kristi Noem is lying,” Boyle said. “We all saw the video. She must resign. And this heinous killing must be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law.”

A spokesperson for Rep. Dwight Evans (D-03) referred the Capital-Star to a social media post.

“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE agents,” Evans wrote. “There should be bipartisan outrage about this tragedy. The Republican majorities in Congress need to join with Democrats to demand reform and accountability. This violence cannot and should not be normalized.”

Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-04) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but both called for investigations on social media. Houlahan also called for the firing of any official who lied about the circumstances of the shooting.

Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman did not respond to the Capital-Star, but called the incident a tragedy in statements to the press last week.

U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal — the Democrat from the state of Washington who is the ranking member on a subcommittee on immigration — chaired the meeting alongside U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis and some surrounding suburbs.

It was the sixth hearing in a series focusing on federal immigration enforcement, but none have seen the response and turnout from members of Congress like this one, she said.

It followed two shootings by ICE in Minneapolis in a week's time, including the killing of Renee Good that sparked national outcry and set off protests. Jayapal and Omar were joined by all DFL members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation and 24 other House Democrats from 18 states.

""We will do everything in our power to hold the administration accountable and stop this lawlessness,"" Jayapal said.

The Trump administration has doubled down on its presence here, maintaining that federal officers are focused on arresting immigrants here illegally who are ""the worst of the worst."" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem told reporters at the White House on Thursday that there are ""no plans"" to pull out of Minnesota.

President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in the state.

""It is increasingly clear that the entire purpose of these actions is to provoke chaos and fear in order to justify invoking the Insurrection Act and expand the president's ability to reign terror upon American cities who do not vote for him,"" Omar said.

Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in Minneapolis, shared with lawmakers her experience being detained by ICE. She said she was arrested after observing ICE operations and was held in custody for more than eight hours before being released with no charges.

""About two minutes into the ride, one agent said, 'You guys got to stop obstructing us. That's why this lesbian b**** is dead,' speaking of Renee Good, which filled me with rage and sadness,"" she said. ""How could you say that?""

Officers, she said, also didn't identify themselves at the time of the arrest and they put her in ankle shackles when she arrived at the Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling to the detention facility.

""At the detention center, I was made to feel intimidated and as though my constitutional rights and biological needs didn't matter. After all that I was released without charges, which makes it clear to me that this is more of a campaign to spread fear and terror than it is to enforce the law,"" O'Keefe said.

The 3,000 agents and officers on the ground amounts to five times the number of Minneapolis police officers patrolling the city.

Mendota Heights Police Chief Kelly McCarthy – who was the onetime chair of the state Peace Officer Standards and Training board – said ICE's conduct in Minnesota is not how local police are trained.

Many members questioned her about some of ICE's tactics. She said their actions are eroding hard-fought efforts to rebuild relationships with communities after George Floyd's murder more than five years ago.

""We have to acknowledge that the tactics of some ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge are reducing the public's trust in local police, making the job of our cops harder and making us all less safe."" McCarthy said.

WCCO reached out to all GOP members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation. Majority Whip Tom Emmer and U.S. Rep. Brad Finstad's offices both said neither Congressmen was invited to participate.

""Minnesota Democrats in Congress had zero interest in asking questions during last week's Oversight hearing on fraud, so their sudden interest to exercise their oversight authorities is almost comical,"" Emmer said in a statement, referencing GOP state lawmakers' testimony to the House Oversight Committee last week about ongoing investigations into alleged fraud in state programs. ""Their political charade of a hearing will do nothing to help turn down the temperature in the Twin Cities. They'll come, they'll rail against law enforcement and the rule of law, and will accomplish nothing.""

A spokesperson for Finstad said he ""doesn't attend Democrat anti-police events.""

Many Democrats during the hearing criticized the influx of $170 billion to the Department of Homeland Security approved by Republicans in the so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" last summer — the largest infusion of money Congress has ever allocated for federal immigration enforcement.

Some threatened not to support an additional appropriations bill for the agency as Congress again stares down a deadline for government funding at the end of the month.

It also saw the birth of the modern national security state.
Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly.
For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency.
Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them.","The Trump administration frequently uses fear as a weapon, whether stoking it, pledging to shield some populations from it, or endeavoring to inflict it on others. For example, the administration has engaged in what “border czar” Tom Homan describes as a “shock and awe” campaign that has included aggressively raiding communities around the country, shipping some migrants to dangerous prisons, and publicizing these actions through highly stylized videos and memes. The administration portrays its targets as “the worst of the worst,” as “pedophiles, armed robbers, and drug traffickers” whom law-abiding citizens should fear. The government’s own data, however, suggests otherwise. According to Reuters, “some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation.” Citizens, too, have been swept up in raids. Entire communities thus have been placed in terror by an administration that claims to be protecting them.

The administration also has employed fear-based governing outside of the immigration context, including against the federal workforce. Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, famously said before the 2024 election that a second Trump administration should inflict “trauma” on federal career employees. He explained that when “‘bureaucrats … wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down …. We want to put them in trauma.’” Vought’s wish has come true, with thousands of federal employees chased out of their jobs through a combination of ideological targeting and large-scale gutting of agencies.

Although Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and their colleagues excel at wielding fear as a tool of governance, they did not invent the practice. In his important new book, “The Triumph of Fear: Domestic Surveillance and Political Repression from McKinley to Eisenhower,” Patrick G. Eddington explores several earlier periods in American history during which federal officials and politicians regularly stoked fear against, and instilled fear in, disfavored targets. Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute who has worked as a CIA analyst, focuses his book on the late 19th century to the 1950s. This era encompassed two world wars, the height of the Cold War, and domestic social and cultural upheaval. It also saw the birth of the modern national security state. Eddington draws on extensive archival research to describe and explain the many ways in which fear pervaded the government and politics of the time and was built into the national security state’s DNA.

Although Eddington navigates the era in a mostly straightforward, chronological manner, several themes and subthemes recur throughout the book. As its title suggests, the book’s overarching theme is fear. Eddington underscores this point from the outset, observing in the introduction that “the driving force” behind the developments he studies—principally the government’s “surveilling, penetrating, and actively subverting domestic political activities”—was “fear.” One aspect of that fear is that felt by “executive branch officials, members of Congress, and those on the federal bench—fear that challenges to existing political, economic, or social paradigms would alter the country in ways that would disempower those who benefitted from the status quo.” As Eddington’s subsequent chapters make clear, fear played a still more ubiquitous role in the events of the time. Politicians and officials not only felt fear themselves; they sought to make others afraid—afraid of their own government and of one another.

Beneath this overarching theme lie the details, spanning decades, of the means that powerful actors in the executive branch, in Congress, and in compliant parts of the private sector used to instill and to respond to fear. Because Eddington covers so much ground, I highlight just three such means here, by way of illustration: the growth of the federal government’s surveillance and secrecy capacities; the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ethnicity and nationality; and the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ideology.

The six decades Eddington explores were pivotal for the growth of the U.S. national security state, including the government’s capacities for surveillance and secrecy. With respect to the federal government’s surveillance activities, Eddington illuminates, among other things, the way that its growth was a product of executive initiative as well as congressional, judicial, and corporate enabling. He explains, for example, that the Treasury Department’s Secret Service Division was the dominant agent of domestic surveillance by the early 20th century, and that it went largely unchecked by Congress for years, even after the press revealed that the division had spied on members of Congress at President Theodore Roosevelt’s direction. Roosevelt had ordered the surveillance in an effort to uncover the source of an earlier media story. A subsequent spying scandal did lead Congress to adopt legislation in 1908, restricting the Secret Service Division’s activities to “defeating counterfeiting and presidential protection.” The scandal was a sensational one: The Navy had directed the division to spy on a naval officer at the urging of the mother of a woman with whom the officer allegedly had had an affair. Even after this scandal and subsequent legislation, however, the Theodore Roosevelt administration remained undeterred. It found a way around the legislative bar by creating a new organization: the Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice. It did so by using the Justice Department’s general revenue fund to employ 30 part-time agents, including many veterans of the Secret Service Division. As employees of the new bureau, these agents conducted domestic surveillance that the Secret Service Division was now barred from conducting.

Eddington traces iterations of this pattern—a mixture of executive initiative, occasional congressional pushback, and more frequent congressional cooperation or willful ignorance—throughout the decades that he chronicles. Take, for example, his coverage of the period from the outbreak of World War I in Europe through the aftermath of both the war and the Russian Revolution. In the months following the sinking of the Lusitania, the Wilson administration grew desperate to surveil suspected German agents and their sympathizers in the United States, leading Wilson to authorize a renewed domestic surveillance role for the Secret Service Division. This action “effectively violate[d] the 1908 law” limiting the division’s activity, and Eddington “found no evidence that Congress was informed” of it. Shortly after the United States entered the war, however, Congress authorized some forms of surveillance by the division—for example, to conduct investigations under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Food and Fuel Control Act. By the end of World War I, “the [division] and [the bureau had] full-fledged domestic spying counterparts in the [Army and Navy].”

These capacities were augmented through cooperation by corporate and civil society actors. For example, the Bureau of Investigation arranged for the major telecommunications providers to transmit copies, without warrants, of “incoming and outgoing telegrams of individuals or organizations of interest to investigators.” The bureau also partnered with a private organization comprised of volunteer investigators, “the American Protective League,” whose members were known to go rogue, “masquerading as [Secret Service] agents” and “in one case ordering a Des Moines, Iowa, resident to raise the American flag over his home.” Eddington also describes how these surveillance precedents and capabilities continued to be utilized after the war’s end. In the postwar years, “the Bolshevik threat [became] the prime, but not exclusive, focus.” As I elaborate below, other targets would include Japanese Americans and critics of their internment.

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly. Although secrecy is frequently used to bypass congressional and judicial oversight, Congress and the judiciary enabled executive secrecy in significant ways. For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency. The Espionage Act of 1917 bars a much wider range of speech, including information disclosures. Eddington stresses the Espionage Act’s importance in this regard, focusing especially on its use to punish anti-war speech and other forms of dissent throughout World War I and the Cold War. The Supreme Court also enabled broad prosecutorial discretion to punish anti-establishment but not imminently dangerous speech in a well-known line of cases beginning in 1919. The Supreme Court’s decisions in those cases, including Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, and Abrams v. United States, endorsed a narrow view of speakers’ First Amendment protections, particularly during wartime.

Eddington also emphasizes the significance of the state secrets privilege and the Supreme Court’s 1953 decision recognizing it in United States v. Reynolds. The privilege may be invoked by the federal government in litigation where “‘there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’” A significant problem with the ruling, as Eddington points out, is its suggestion that in some cases judges should not require disclosure even to themselves, for in camera inspection. The danger of abuse that this creates is evidenced in the aftermath of Reynolds itself. The case originated as a tort suit brought by a group of widows whose husbands, all civilian engineers, had perished in a crash of an Air Force B-29 bomber. The Air Force successfully resisted disclosing the accident report on the basis that it contained state secrets, and the Supreme Court refused to order even in camera disclosure. Decades later, the accident report, which by then had been declassified, was obtained by the grown child of one of the passengers. She learned that the Air Force had lied so many years ago. The report contained no state secrets but instead revealed negligence on the part of the Air Force.

The scope of the surveillance and secrecy capacities that Eddington explores is breathtaking, but their greatest significance lies in their wielding by government actors as tools to target disfavored groups and ideas. Among the most notorious instances of ethnic or nationality-based targeting was that perpetrated against Japanese Americans during World War II. Eddington’s research sheds new light on the extent of the government’s surveillance of Japanese Americans before and during World War II, and on the gulf between the information it gathered and the lies it told to stoke fear against, and justify the mass internment of, this group. For example, John Franklin Carter, whom President Franklin Roosevelt had secretly commissioned to perform intelligence work for FDR directly, concluded that “98 percent of the Japanese in Hawaii were ‘loyal to the U.S., and that those who are not’” had already been identified by the Navy and the FBI. In a cover letter forwarding one of his reports to FDR, Carter wrote, chillingly and prophetically, that his investigator “‘feels that the Japanese are more in danger from the whites than the other way around.’”

Eddington also highlights the political considerations that led FDR not only to support mass internment for Japanese Americans, but to prolong it. For example, he cites a memo that FDR wrote to two officials, explaining his view that “it would be a mistake to do anything drastic or sudden” in ending internment. FDR “wanted to determine ‘how many Japanese families would be acceptable to public opinion’ for relocation back to the West Coast” and suggested distributing Japanese Americans around the United States to “avoid[] public outcry” on the West coast. As an intelligence report that Eddington quotes acknowledged, the violent public backlash that did follow Japanese Americans’ return home stemmed both from “racial hatred” and “from whites who [did] not want to resume business competition with returning Japanese.”

Surveillance was also used to target ideological dissenters, including those who criticized the federal government’s actions against Japanese Americans. As Eddington recounts, “Such was the fate of a young Army private and aspiring singer-songwriter named Pete Seeger.” Seeger, who had a Japanese American fiancée (who eventually became his wife of nearly 70 years), wrote to the California American Legion to protest its passage of a resolution calling to deport all Japanese and Japanese Americans from the United States and to bar citizenship for all Japanese descendants. The Legion forwarded Seeger’s letter to the FBI, which eventually built an intelligence file on Seeger that ran more than 1,700 pages.

Seeger’s case is just the tip of the iceberg of ideological surveillance and punishment in American history. Eddington chronicles much of this history, ranging from the Secret Service Division’s targeting of anarchists and the nascent Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of socialists, through the Palmer Raids, Espionage Act prosecutions of socialist and other speakers, “anti-red” scares stoked by members of Congress and the executive branch, and the efforts across many presidential administrations to surveil and target participants in the civil rights movement.

Among the many striking elements in Eddington’s account of ideological targeting is the way that politicians stoked and wielded fears of socialism and communism to aggrandize themselves and to intimidate and control rival politicians. Eddington recounts, for example, that the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities had lost public and institutional support by 1944 but was revived and turned into a permanent committee after Rep. John Rankin, partnering with the American Legion, launched a public campaign to support it. The resuscitated committee went on to “do massive professional, personal, and political damage to thousands of individual Americans and domestic civil society organizations.” The prospect of committee “witch hunt[s]” also led some congressional Democrats, including Rep. Jennings Randolph, successfully to pressure President Truman to employ harsh internal loyalty measures throughout the executive branch. Eddington also gives their due to those administration members, representatives, and other high-profile figures who resisted the “anti-red” race to the bottom. Eleanor Roosevelt, for one, was a voice of conscience, writing to Truman: “I feel we have capitulated to our fear of Communism, and instead of fighting to improve Democracy, we are doing what the Soviets would do in trying to repress anything which we are afraid might not command public support.”

Eddington’s book is a rich, important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in American history, and of the growth of America’s national security state in particular. Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them. As he notes in his introduction, however, “The Triumph of Fear” is extraordinary in its scale and in its use of primary as well as secondary literature to illuminate its subject. And Eddington is particularly effective in his choice of stories to highlight and to connect to the book’s larger theme of fear-based governing and politics.

My one criticism of the book is that Eddington occasionally adds a conclusory statement about legality to an otherwise compelling, evidence-based description of government activity. For example, in discussing proposed legislation to criminalize certain disclosures about cryptology, Eddington states: “This was not an encroachment on the First Amendment—it was a proposal to destroy it in the name of national security.” Having written a great deal myself on the law of national security disclosures and the First Amendment, I am extremely sympathetic to Eddington’s point. It is, however, a complicated legal topic to which justice cannot be done in a single sentence. That said, my quibble is a small one because statements like the quoted one make up a tiny part of an otherwise excellent book. I mention this quibble only because the book on the whole is so strong and because its strength stems largely from its intensely research-driven approach.

Because Eddington does, admirably, let his exhaustive research do most of the talking, he does not step outside of the studied time period to explicitly draw comparisons to the current administration. But readers will do as they please, and I suspect I will not be alone in seeing parallels between some of the terrible developments that Eddington chronicles and events now taking place on a regular basis in the United States. Readers likely will see not only parallels but roots, as today’s abuses are enabled in part by the growth in the national security state that Eddington recounts. Eddington’s book would still be an important contribution even if it were not so lamentably relevant to current events. But in this moment, especially, I am grateful for Eddington’s work. The historical context that it provides enables us better to understand what it is that we are living through.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/surveillance-camera-(1).png?sfvrsn=1f2a75b9_5,N,,2026-01-17 05:58:01.496369

In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ESA Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virg.), and U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned the changes would gut environmental review, strip protections from hundreds of vulnerable species, and let politics override science in listing decisions—all while the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service face unprecedented staffing and budget shortfalls thanks to the Trump administration.

“These sweeping changes would fundamentally weaken our nation's most important wildlife conservation law at a time when one million species face extinction globally,” wrote the lawmakers. “We urge the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw these proposed rulemakings and instead work to implement the ESA as Congress intended: any regulatory changes should further the objectives of the ESA to conserve species and prevent extinction.”

The ESA has prevented more than 99 percent of listed species from going extinct and has helped hundreds move toward recovery. Section 7 consultations typically take just two weeks for informal review and two months for formal review—contrary to conventional wisdom, the ESA does not stop projects from moving forward. According to one peer-reviewed study, the ESA did not halt a single project between 2008 and 2015.

The lawmakers highlighted how the proposed rules would:

Gut Section 7 consultation requirements by letting agencies claim project impacts “would occur regardless of whether the proposed action goes forward” — a loophole that could exempt highways, pipelines, and development projects from meaningful scrutiny;

Strip protections from threatened species — by rescinding the “blanket 4(d) rule” that extends baseline protections to all threatened species, creating dangerous years-long protection gaps that resource-agencies can’t fill. The blanket 4(d) rule provides automatic protections to species such as the piping plover and the West Indian Manatee, species listed as threatened in the future would not receive those same baseline protections; and

Let politics override science by injecting cherry-picked ‘economic’ considerations into listing decisions. Congress explicitly required that listing decisions be based solely on the best available science, not on arbitrary evaluations of certain impacts or political pressures.

“With reduced staff and resources, the Services should prioritize addressing the backlog of species awaiting protection and advancing recovery efforts for those already listed, rather than redirecting attention to rewriting long-standing and effective regulations,” continued the lawmakers. “Habitat destruction and climate change are accelerating species extinction to alarming rates, and we should be working to uphold and strengthen the ESA, not weaken it.”

The letter notes that roughly 90 percent of listed species are threatened by habitat loss, making the proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation particularly damaging to recovery efforts.",https://beyer.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 13:57:27.126306

New Jersey Democrats are objecting to reported plans to build yet another immigrant detention center within the state; some of them have signed onto articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; and there may be an effort to block new funding for the Department of Homeland Security as part of the annual appropriations process. Here’s some of what New Jersey’s members of Congress did in Washington this week.

What not to warehouse

A report in the Washington Post that DHS is looking into converting warehouses in Morris County’s Roxbury Township into an immigrant detention facility has caused a significant stir.

On Wednesday, all ten Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation sent a letter to top DHS officials objecting to the reported proposal, saying that DHS needed to “immediately abandon” any plans to come to Roxbury. (Roxbury’s local GOP congressman, Tom Kean Jr., was not included on the letter and has so far declined to comment on the report.)

“Any expansion of immigrant detention in New Jersey, especially under warehouse conditions that are fundamentally inappropriate for human habitation, contradicts both the interests and values of our state,” states the letter, which was led by Reps. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), and LaMonica McIver (D-Newark).

Roxbury local officials, too, have reacted to the report with alarm; following local protests, the all-Republican township council passed a resolution opposing the placement of a detention facility in the town.

New Jersey is already home to two operational immigrant detention facilities, one in Newark and another in Elizabeth, and plans are underway to create more detention capacity at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst military installation.

Noem more!

After a woman was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week, calls to impeach or otherwise remove Secretary Noem have exploded among Democrats, and at least three of New Jersey’s Democratic House members are on board. Articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly earlier this week, with Reps. Menendez, Watson Coleman, and McIver all listed as co-sponsors.

“Every day that Secretary Noem remains in office is a day that communities across our country are unsafe and that Americans are at risk,” Menendez said. “We cannot allow this to continue. Since President Trump won’t remove Secretary Noem, I am supporting articles of impeachment.”

Plenty of other Democrats have also called for Noem to go, including for reasons beyond immigration; Reps. Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch) led a letter this week demanding that President Donald Trump remove Noem from office due to her “misguided leadership” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a call that Rep. Herb Conaway (D-Delran) signed onto as well.

“Kristi Noem has proven herself no better suited for a leadership role, and we urge you to immediately remove her and submit qualified nominees to lead DHS and FEMA to the Senate as soon as possible,” the letter states. “The American people deserve better.”

Freezing out ICE

Government funding bills continued to wend their way through Congress this week, lessening the prospect of another government shutdown at the end of the month. But not every New Jersey Democrat is on board: Senators Kim and Booker both voted against one appropriations package in the Senate, while Reps. McIver, Watson Coleman, and Menendez opposed another in the House.

And one of the bills that has yet to make it through either chamber of Congress, funding the DHS, could prove to be a particular challenge. Some Democrats are signaling their disapproval of any measure that would give more money to the government’s controversial immigration enforcement efforts, among them Booker.

“I am not going to support a budget that gives more money to an agency right now that is out of control,” Booker said, per Pix11. “That’s not even a question for me. I will not be voting to support this budget until we start seeing some true accountability and high professional standards.”

Booker also introduced a pair of bills this week to reign in the power of ICE and the DHS: one requiring immigration enforcement officers to wear body cameras, and a second that would establish higher training standards for federal law enforcement officers. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-Camden), too, introduced a separate body camera-related bill in the House.

The failed votes will continue until morale improves

A relatively obscure bill that would have limited overtime pay for voluntary worker training programs unexpectedly failed on the House floor this week, with two of New Jersey’s Republican congressmen among those responsible.

Reps. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) and Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis) – both of whom have longstanding ties to organized labor despite their party affiliation – joined a breakaway group of six Republicans who sank the bill, and GOP leaders pulled two other labor-related bills from consideration soon afterwards. According to NJ Spotlight News, both congressmen felt that the bill would be a blow to organized labor, with Smith even brandishing a letter from the AFL-CIO to make his point.

“Once I really understood and looked at the bill, I didn’t feel comfortable,” Van Drew told NJ Spotlight after the vote. “Bottom line: People who got a certain amount in their paychecks would get less. I don’t agree with that.”

Tuesday’s vote wasn’t the first time New Jersey’s Republicans defected on a labor bill this Congress; in December, Van Drew, Smith, and Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) all teamed up to support a Democratic-led bill restoring collective bargaining rights for federal workers.

War powerless

Last week, it looked like the GOP-controlled Senate might take the remarkable step of rebuking President Trump’s military actions in Venezuela via a war powers resolution, which would have required congressional approval for further operations. But while five Republican senators voted to advance the resolution last week, two of them returned to the Republican fold when it came up for a further vote on Wednesday, dooming it to failure.

Senators Booker and Andy Kim both strongly supported the resolution, and Booker said that Republicans “refused to do their jobs” to reassert congressional authority over acts of war.

“The Constitution is unambiguous: Congress has the power and responsibility to authorize the use of military force and declare war,” Booker said. “Congress has a duty of oversight. Congress must serve as a check, not a rubber stamp, to the President. Congressional Republicans have failed on all of these counts.”

En banc shot

A month and a half after her disqualification from service as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey by a three-judge federal appellate panel, Alina Habba made a move this week to get the entire Third Circuit to reconsider her case.

Habba resigned from her contested office in December after the Third Circuit ruled against her, but said at the time that she would be interested in returning if the courts allowed it. Now, with its new petition to get an en banc rehearing, the Justice Department is once again gearing up to make the argument that President Trump’s unusual appointment of Habba was lawful and proper.

“The panel’s interpretation of the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act] would hobble Presidential transitions and has been routinely violated by the last four administrations without any court holding the practice unlawful,” the motion states. “Rehearing en banc is warranted.”

In the month since Habba resigned, New Jersey’s U.S. Attorney’s office has been led by a triumvirate of officials who each have jurisdiction over different divisions of the office – though the Trump administration said that arrangement, too, has come under legal challenge.

Congressman names a bill after the thing that nearly killed him

Rep. Norcross nearly died last year after a gallbladder infection progressed to sepsis, and he’s now putting forward legislation to help others like him. The SEPSIS Act – which, of course, stands for the Securing Enhanced Programs, Systems and Initiatives for Sepsis Act – would direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a new sepsis education program and direct staff and resources to focus on the condition.

“I am here today because of the excellent doctors and nurses who saved my life, but too many families aren’t as lucky,” Norcross said. “With the SEPSIS Act, we can change that. We can save lives and reduce the devastating toll this condition has on our loved ones.”

Norcross has a bipartisan pair of New Jersey co-sponsors in Rep. Kean and Senator Kim; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) are also taking up the charge in the upper chamber.

“New Jersey has long been a leader in the fight against sepsis, and I am grateful to partner with a fellow member of our state’s delegation to bring this critical effort to the federal level,” Kean said.

Other Garden State plots

• With an especially aggressive strain of the flu sweeping the nation, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-Tenafly) put forward a set of proposals this week for states to fight back, including via his FIGHT FLU Act, which would give states more money for mobile flu vaccination centers.

“This flu season is particularly deadly, and we need more people to get their flu shots,” Gottheimer said. “Again, let me be as clear as day: Politicians should not overrule doctors. Ideology should never replace science. And when families get confused, fewer kids get vaccinated – and more kids end up in hospitals like this one.”

• Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration suddenly cut off $2 billion worth of funding for mental health and drug addiction services – then, after an outcry, reversed course just 24 hours later. Democrats reacted to the entire saga with derision and alarm.

“This series of events showcase the ineptitude of Secretary Kennedy and the overzealous nature of his team,” Rep. Watson Coleman said. “I’m working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to put in guardrails to prevent Secretary Kennedy and the extremists in the Trump administration from ever doing this again.”

• Rep. Van Drew announced this week that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has completed its restructuring of the Atlantic City Housing Authority after taking it over last year, and said that there will be 25-40 new job opportunities at the agency.

“I have always said the residents living under the previous ACHA deserved better, and now we are finally seeing some real progress,” Van Drew said. “HUD came in, did a full overhaul, and focused on what actually matters: putting residents first. Now that work is paying off.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bonnie-impeachment.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:13.938719
