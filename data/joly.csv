BROWN, Getty Images",,,,,https://www.thestreet.com/retail/formerly-bankrupt-retail-healthcare-chain-may-go-bankrupt-again,"One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy.
Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.
Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018.
As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023.
Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.","It's been a very tough time to be in the retail business. Thousands of stores nationwide been closed over the past two decades because of e-commerce adoption, and the situation has accelerated since Covid forced more consumers inside and online.

Once formidable major retailers like Sears have been shuttered, and even retail store chains considered essential like pharmacy's have been stung by shifting consumer trends as competition has intensified.

It has gotten even harder to eke out a living as a retailer since inflation skyrocketed in 2022, crimping budgets. Inflation has eased a bit since then, but prices are still climbing and cash-strapped consumers have largely rotated away from discretionary purchases that retailers rely on.

In February, the Consumer Price Index showed inflation had increased to 2.8% from 2.4% last September, raising concern that prices could reignite, something even more in focus following newly instituted tariffs on imports that add more price pressures.

Worse, fears of economic recession are mounting this year as unemployment climbs.

Altogether, the backdrop has created an environment where even the strongest retailers are struggling. Weaker retailers? Well, they're on the ropes.

A retail reckoning forces companies into bankruptcy

Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows retailers to pare expenses and debt, giving them wiggle room necessary for a shot at survival. However, bankruptcy remains a last resort for companies.

Bankruptcy protection means damaged relationships with suppliers, bankers, workers, and customers. As a result, suppliers may cut off retailers, banks may not lend money necessary to operate, and workers and customers may move on to greener pastures.

Nevertheless, sometimes bankruptcy is the only option. Increasingly, that's been true for many companies.

It may be hard to believe today, but Sears ran 700 stores when it filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Bed Bath & Beyond had 1,500 stores in 2018, but fewer than 300 in 2023 when it went bankrupt, and none are open anymore. Christmas Tree Shops operated more than 80 stores before all were closed when it went bankrupt.

The economy has certainly been a driving force behind the retail reckoning, but fierce competition hasn't helped.

Walmart, Target, and Costco Wholesale have all seen significant revenue growth over the past decade as they successfully leverage their size to offer consumers lower prices, and expand into new markets.

Walmart and Costco's revenue have risen to $681 billion and $254 billion in 2024 from $408 billion and $78 billion in 2010, respectively.

One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy. Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.

In addition to fending off larger department stores, the national chain counted on by millions for essentials from toothpaste to prescriptions has also lost market share due to upstarts like Mark Cuban's CostPlus Drug Company, a low cost mail order pharmacy, and Hims, a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based telehealth platform.

Rite Aid enters, exits bankruptcy but woes remain

Rite Aid spent a lot of money acquiring rival pharmacies, including Brooks, in a bid to keep pace with Walgreens and CVS Health. The spending accelerated its retail footprint, but also saddled it with a mountain of debt that needed to be refinanced at higher rates when it came due.

The weight of its debt was already taking a toll before Covid struck. It attempted to sell itself to Walgreens in 2015, but the deal was revised after the U.S. government objected for antitrust concerns. Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018. A deal to sell itself to Albertsons was also scuttled in 2018.

Rite Aid continued to try to find a buyer but by 2022, when the Fed hiked interest rates, making debt refinancing more costly, it was in dire straights.

The final blow came in March 2023. The Department of Justice filed a civil suit against Rite Aid alleging pharmacists “repeatedly filled prescriptions for controlled substances with obvious red flags"" and that Rite Aid ""intentionally deleted internal notes about suspicious prescribers.”

Similar suits had previously been settled by Walgreens and CVS Health for $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, figures that Rite Aid couldn't match.

As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023. While in bankruptcy, it cut deals with lenders, closed over 500 stores, roughly a quarter of its locations, and settled the Justice Department's suit for $7.5 million and an unsubordinated, general unsecured claim of $401.8 million.

The company exited bankruptcy in September 2024, saying at the time it ""has successfully completed its financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11, marking a new beginning as a stronger company with a rightsized store footprint, more efficient operating model, significantly less debt, and additional financial resources.”

Unfortunately, the restructuring may not have been enough to guarantee Rite Aid's success, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The WSJ said on April 4 that Rite Aid's management is seeking buyers again and contemplating another bankruptcy filing. Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.

There's no telling what might happen to Rite Aid's remaining 1,300 stores if it sells itself or enters bankruptcy protection again. It's certainly possible more stores will close, leaving additional customers in the lurch, searching for a new pharmacy.

One potential option may be to follow in Walgreens footsteps.

(GADC), or McDonald’s Philippines, plans to invest at least ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion this year to open more than 65 stores, with the aim of reaching 1,000 stores in two years.

This comes as GADC Founder and Chairman George T. Yang said they will embark on an accelerated growth path for the quick-service restaurant (QSR) giant after McDonald’s Corp. of the United States (US) granted Yang and his son, GADC President and CEO Kenneth S. Yang, a fresh 20-year franchise for the Philippines.

“This 2025, We will be opening our 800th store,” said the younger Yang. McDonald’s opened 65 stores last year and ended 2024 with a network of 792 stores nationwide.

In a media interview, GADC’s CEO said, “We will continue to build new restaurants all over the Philippines. We grow through our company-owned stores as well as through our franchise restaurants.”

“For this year, most likely, we should grow about the same as what we did last year, which is 65 stores. Hopefully we will surpass it,” said Yang.

Since 65 new stores in a year was an all-time high for the company, he said, “This 2025, we aim to break our record new store openings.”

While expansion will be nationwide, Yang said most of the new stores will be outside the National Capital Region (NCR)—in cities in southern and northern Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

“We see our growth coming from areas outside of NCR that have rapidly been developing. We’re excited to open more stores and bring McDonald’s closer to more Filipinos,” Yang said.

He noted that, “The country is growing and there is progress in these areas so that is where we will be going.”

He said that they will likely maintain the current ratio of 55 percent company-owned stores and 45 percent franchise outlets.

Yang said they spent around ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion for the renovation of older restaurants and construction of new ones, and capital expenditures (capex) this year should at least be equal or higher.

In 2005, McDonald’s Philippines became a 100-percent Filipino-owned company with George and Kenneth Yang as its majority owners and tycoon Andrew Tan’s Alliance Global Group Inc. as its investment partner.

This strategic move paved the way for the company to look towards a digitally led future, underpinned by growing demand for seamless omni-channel customer experience.

The company extended its reach by growing its delivery business through digital initiatives. It was the first QSR to have an online delivery channel in 2009 and the first to launch a delivery app in 2014.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

That being said, you can find a dozen eggs for under $5 in most grocery stores. If you join a warehouse club like Costco or Sam’s Club, you might even be able to get a better deal.

It’s easy to understand why people do not like seeing the price of everyday staples go up. In reality, however, most families probably eat no more than a couple of dozen eggs a week.

If they eat the full two dozen, let’s say that their expenses increase by basically five dollars per week. That’s $260 a year.

Admittedly, eggs are not the only staple that has increased in price, which is causing many Americans to feel the pinch of inflation and higher prices.

Spending more at the grocery store each week is death by 1,000 paper cuts, which is a painful way to die.

But if you suffer one giant cut, the reality is you’re just as dead. Americans have some options to buy food produced in this country that won’t be impacted by tariffs.

Certain staples like coffee, well, almost certainly increase, but even there, there are options, at least if all you want is a caffeine fix. When it comes to electronics, there are no options.

Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Sue Barry did not pull any punches when it came to discussing tariffs during the electronics retailer's fourth-quarter earnings call.

""Against this backdrop, I need to pause a moment to address the topic of tariffs. International trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively,"" she shared.

The CEO also made it clear that tariffs would be passed on to the retailer, which would then have to pass them onto consumers.

""While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,"" she shared.

Barry admitted that she does not have all the answers.

""This is because it is a highly dynamic situation, with uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount, and countries involved, in addition to the potential action of others in the industry, as well as the potential reaction of American consumers,"" she said.

Best Buy, American consumers face higher prices

Best Buy does have flexibility on some products and Barry wanted to make it clear that it will be actively looking to offset the increased costs as much as possible.

""I want to stress that our deeply tenured and talented teams are experienced at operating in volatile conditions, and this is also a situation where our partnerships with vendors are extremely valuable. We intend to execute the strategic plan we set for this year while navigating the tariff environment,"" she added.

CFO Matthew Bilunas made it clear, or at least as clear as someone speaking in financial terms could, that consumers will pay more.

""We're assuming in this estimation that a material portion of the costs are passed on to us by the vendors and then either, that's either directly broken out or blended in with the higher COGS (cost of goods sold) or through some level of promotional positioning.

Trump’s tariffs are having a much bigger impact than expected on Nike

Trump’s most recent list includes nations that produce clothing, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which are presumably further down the alphabet than Denmark, the European Union, and Greenland. Besides Nike, huge companies like Adidas and Puma source their supplies from the two nations listed, and Trump’s decision has caused their stock market value to plummet like a driverless Tesla into the Hudson River. Following the announcement of the news, shares of Skechers, Deckers, and Crocs also declined.

On Wednesday, the United States levied reciprocal tariffs of 46% on Vietnamese goods, 49% on Cambodian goods, 34% on Chinese goods, 32% on Indonesian goods, and 36% on Thai goods. Although Nike’s stock is still steady for the time being, analysts believe that the American brand will decline soon because it also depends significantly on imports from the aforementioned countries. Nike itself anticipates a more than 10% decline in revenue in the upcoming quarter, according to CNBC, and their figures are significantly worse than those of analysts.

Finance director Matt Friend anticipates that Nike’s initiatives will have the most impact in the fourth quarter, with revenue and gross margin headwinds projected to moderate. The corporation is also dealing with external challenges such as geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, variable foreign exchange rates, and tax rules, all of which may influence consumer confidence.

Besides Nike, American Eagle, and Wayfair could also be impacted due to Trump’s tariffs

Brands and retailers have shifted some or all of their production out of China and are now using Vietnam to manufacture everything from couches to sneakers. For many years, businesses wishing to stay out of the crossfire of U.S. trade conflicts with Beijing turned to China’s southern neighbor. They are now unable to avoid President Donald Trump as he broadens his trade war globally. As part of a new round of international tariffs announced Wednesday, Trump declared he would impose a 46% levy on Vietnamese products.

Major companies in the clothing, furniture, and toy industries may soon see cost rises as a result, and some of them may boost prices for customers. On April 9, the Vietnam tariffs go into force. Donald Trump announced a new round of international tariffs on Wednesday, including a 46% duty on Vietnamese imports. This may soon result in cost rises for large companies in the toy, furniture, and clothing industries, some of which may raise prices for customers. On April 9, the tariffs on Vietnam go into force.

Moreover, Mexico overtook China as the largest supplier of commodities to the United States in 2023, after China had been the leading exporter for more than 20 years. Government statistics from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show that, with $438.9 billion in products sold in 2024, China is now the second-largest supplier to the United States. Vietnam has also grown in popularity as a destination for businesses seeking to diversify their manufacturing sources and lower the risks associated with trade disputes with China.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nike.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:47.825213

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands.","Starbucks is one of the most well-known and beloved coffee chains in the United States. With thousands of stores across the country, the company has kept enormous popularity over the years. Its success lies in a varied offering of beverages and a service that aims to be quick and efficient.

However, behind every cup they sell, there are small details that often go unnoticed. An example of this is, for instance, the measurement marks that allow baristas to prepare drinks with precision.

This Is the Change That Starbucks Has Already Implemented in the United States

For years, Starbucks cups included black marks on their sides. These lines were not just decorative, as some might think. Their function was very practical: they allowed employees to measure the ingredients of each drink accurately.

Each line on the tall, grande, and venti cups marked a precise amount of liquid. This facilitated the quick and efficient preparation of popular drinks like the iced chai tea latte. Thus, Starbucks baristas didn't need external measuring tools, which optimized the service.

However, recently, Starbucks made an important change: it modified the marks to a more visible design. The new cups feature white and black lines, which improve visibility in both light and dark beverages. Additionally, these cups include raised dots to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

This change wasn't the only one. Starbucks implemented opaque paper cups in 14 states in the United States, removing the measurement marks. The company also opted for compostable cups and lids made of the same material, reducing its use of plastic.

The transition has caused divided opinions among customers. While some applaud Starbucks's effort to promote a more sustainable change, others lament the loss of the transparent cups. Customers can no longer see their drink—and what's left of it in the cup—as they did before.

Despite the criticism it has received, Starbucks continues to bet firmly on innovation and continuous improvement. The company keeps seeking a balance between functionality and sustainability. So, although some customers may take time to adapt to the new designs, it is likely that over time they will get used to the modifications.

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands. The brand continues to stand out for its ability to adapt and stay at the forefront, establishing itself as a leader in innovation within the sector.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-starbucks-con-bandera-estados-unidos-al-lado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-06 09:01:53.922466

Too Rich for the Middle Class?
There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze.
India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing.
Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out.","Starbucks (SBUX) came to India more than a decade ago with big dreams. Now, those dreams are hitting a patch of reality. According to a report in the Financial Times, the coffee giant has sharply slowed its store expansion in the country, opening just 16 new outlets in the last quarter of 2024 – barely half of what it had aimed for. That’s a far cry from the 1,000-store target by 2028, which was announced in early 2023, which now looks more like a stretch goal than a clear path.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

What Is the Price Target for SBUX Stock?

Turning Wall Street, Starbucks is considered a Moderate Buy based on 24 ratings. The average price target for SBUX stock is $111.64, implying a 35.98% upside potential.

The US coffee giant, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, had last year announced plans to nearly triple its store count to 1,000 outlets by 2028.
In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook.
Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India.
The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise.","Starbucks has sharply slowed the pace of its store expansion in India amid intensifying competition in the country’s evolving café culture and signs of consumer fatigue, The Financial Times has reported.

The US coffee giant, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, had last year announced plans to nearly triple its store count to 1,000 outlets by 2028. But that target is now facing headwinds, as middle-class consumers pull back on discretionary spending and rivals flood the market with newer and more affordable café options.

In an interview with The Financial Times, Sunil D’Souza, Chief Executive of Tata Consumer Products, said Starbucks opened only ""a little over half"" the 30 stores it had targeted for the December quarter. “We saw traffic dropping,” D’Souza said. “So I told my team, let’s moderate a bit. We’ll continue to grow and we’re still opening outlets, but we’ve slowed it down momentarily.”

Starbucks opened a net 16 stores in the three months through December, bringing the total to 473 across 74 Indian cities — well below the post-pandemic record of 29 store additions in the January-March quarter last year.

India, though traditionally a tea-drinking nation, has seen a boom in speciality cafés in recent years, led by homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave Coffee, alongside global entrants such as Tim Hortons, Pret A Manger, and Costa Coffee. The report said this surge in new-age coffee brands, coupled with changing urban preferences, is reshaping how Indians consume beverages outside the home.

In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook. The report said the coffee chain introduced smaller ""Picco"" cup sizes, a milky short masala chai priced at Rs320, and food items like chilli paneer sandwiches — part of its effort to blend international appeal with Indian flavours.

To make its cafés more inviting in smaller cities, the company also moved away from darker, high-end interiors to lighter colours that signal affordability and accessibility.

D’Souza said in the interview that in non-metro markets, many consumers still view the brand as premium. “Often we’ve heard that people are not entering because they see this as... a luxury,” he said.

Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India. “There’s a long runway — it’s just that in a country like India, you’ve got to have a slightly longer perspective,” D’Souza said. He added that the 1,000-store goal still stands, though the timeline “might go up or down by a year.”

During its third quarter investor call, the company said affordability-focused efforts are gaining traction, even as demand pressures persist. The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise. Expansion picked up in East India, with new stores in Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bilaspur, and Gangtok.

To improve local relevance, the company introduced a “classic menu” tailored to Indian taste preferences. Initial trials showed promising repeat purchases, the company noted. It also launched a Diwali 360-campaign with a media reach of over 40 million, and introduced Monsoon Malabar — a reserve small-lot coffee developed exclusively for the Indian market.

Globally too, Starbucks has hit a rough patch. The report noted the company has seen four straight quarters of declining same-store sales, weighed down by slowing footfall in both the US and China — its two largest markets. In China, it has been undercut by faster-growing rivals like Luckin Coffee.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-04-06%2Fzz6jbkqa%2Fhiroko-nishimura-SiSLeFTr5Cg-unsplash.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-04-06 06:01:14.403466

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”. MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

Some 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the U.S. on Saturday in what organizers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.

Thousands were streaming into downtown Washington as the protests got underway. Organisers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the National Mall.

The protests in the U.S. will give Trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to Trump’s raft of executive orders.

Some 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests are planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.

Protesters were lining the busy thoroughfare of Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C., awaiting buses to take them downtown. They were carrying signs with slogans such as “No Kings in the USA” and “Deport Musk.”

Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the Washington Monument.

She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”

David Madden, a 75-year old Army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from Dayton, Ohio, to demonstrate against “the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the American people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that I believe is essentially racist.”

Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London.

Wall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president’s risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs.

Experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday’s extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative – but just how bad remains highly uncertain.

Here are the key stories at a glance:

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.

A JLR spokesperson said: “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of Britain’s biggest producers, selling 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually.

Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales and JLR is at the centre of Britain’s car industry, accounting for £1 in every £8 of the country’s exports.

The Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. Shipping vehicles across the Atlantic takes about 21 days.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in central London as part of global demonstrations against Donald Trump’s administration.

Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on Saturday afternoon with banners which read “No to Maga hate” and “Dump Trump”.

The rally is one of hundreds of so-called “hands off” demonstrations around the world – including in cities across the US, Paris and Berlin.

The movement has been organised by more than 150 groups, including civil rights groups and trade unions.

A 25% levy on all foreign cars imported into America came into force on Thursday, and a wider “baseline” 10% tariff on goods imported from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning.

Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their “concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia” in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Starmer’s office said.

The UK’s prime minister spoke to the French president on Saturday, the latest in a series of calls with world leaders following the announcement of the US levies.

Issuing a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister spoke with President Macron following this week’s announcement that the US will impose additional tariffs. They agreed that a trade war was in nobody’s interests but nothing should be off the table and that it was important to keep business updated on developments.

“The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia.

“Following discussions between military planners in Ukraine this week, they discussed the good progress that has been made on the Coalition of the Willing.

“The prime minister and president agreed to stay in close contact over the coming weeks.”

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Donald Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signaled little concern about the ongoing nosedive, reports Reuters.

“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

“If I were to analyse in my old hat, and this is the only time I’m going to talk about it … what’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a Maga problem,” Bessent, who ran a hedge fund until being tapped as treasury secretary by Trump, said.

“Mag 7” refers to the shares of the “Magnificent 7” – a group of seven high-performing tech stocks that had helped drive the market higher before its recent selloff. Maga refers to Trump’s “Make America great again” political slogan.

US stocks have tumbled by about 10% in the two days after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating.

It is a drop that market analysts and large investors themselves have laid at the feet of Trump’s aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth, reports Reuters.

Stocks did take a hit in late January when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent services. It resulted in a record one-day loss of nearly $600bn in value from the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, one of the “Magnificent 7”. But the market soon found its footing again and by mid-February, the benchmark S&P 500 index had regained a record-high level.

Then stocks turned south again starting in late February after a widely followed survey of consumers showed households growing broadly pessimistic about the economy’s prospects and fearful that Trump’s push for tariffs would drive up inflation, reports Reuters.

A raft of other surveys of businesses and consumers since then have flagged similar concerns, and other data has shown the pace of activity has slowed over the course of the first quarter of 2025. The S&P has lost nearly 14% since 19 February, and nearly $10tn of US stock market value has been erased.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has been dismissive of the drop as well.

Trump himself on Friday retweeted a social media post bearing the caption “Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market” and featuring images of the president pointing at a large downward red arrow and of him signing executive orders at the White House.

Meanwhile, Bessent also told Carlson the administration retains a “strong dollar” policy and dismissed assertions by some analysts that the tariff drive was a deliberate effort to weaken the dollar to make US goods more competitive on global markets.

“No one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the US dollar other than President Trump or myself,” Bessent said. “We are the only ones that speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy.”

“We have a strong-dollar policy and we are putting in all of the necessary ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run,” he said.

The dollar has shed nearly 6% of its value against major trading partners’ currencies since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, reports Reuters.

'Hang tough, it won’t be easy': Trump defiant on tariffs

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.

The comments came as the US president’s widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.

“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.

“This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

A 10% “baseline” tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.

The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes”.

Come 9 April, about 60 trading partners – including the European Union, Japan and China – are to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.

Already, Trump’s sharp 34%tariff on Chinese goods, to kick in next week, triggered Beijing’s announcement of its own 34% tariff on US products from 10 April.

Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict the export of rare-earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.

“China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,” Trump said in his post. “They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly.”

But other major trading partners held back as they digested the unfolding international standoff amid fears of a recession.

Leading garment producer Bangladesh holds crisis talks on US tariffs

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Textile and garment production accounts for about 80% of exports in Bangladesh, and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hard hit in a revolution that toppled the government last year.

Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

Bangladesh exports $8.4bn of garments annually to the US, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national trade body. That totals about 20% of Bangladesh’s total ready-made garments exports, reports afp.

“Chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has convened an emergency meeting … to discuss the US tariff issue,” a government statement read, with the meeting to take place late Saturday in the capital, Dhaka. Top experts, advisers and officials will attend, it added.

Bangladesh’s tax authority, the National Board of Revenue, is also expected to meet to review the fallout from the tariffs.

Rakibul Alam Chowdhury, chair of RDM Group, a major manufacturer with an estimated $25m turnover, said on Thursday that the industry would lose trade. “Buyers will go to other cost-competitive markets – this is going to be a massive blow for our industry,” he said.

Several garment factories produce clothing for the US market alone, report AFP. Anwar Hossain, administrator of the BGMEA, has told AFP that the industry was “not ready” for the tariff impact.

Bangladesh, the second-largest producer after China, manufactures garments for global brands – including for US firms such as Gap Inc, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi Strauss.

Jaguar Land Rover to pause shipments to the US as it works to 'address new trading terms'

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs, reports the PA news agency.

In a statement on Saturday, a JLR spokesperson said:

The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands.

As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

Earlier on Saturday, the Times had reported that JLR would pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month (see 11.48am BST).

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Donald Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods.

According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

It came after the US president, who has called on Tehran to hold direct negotiations on its nuclear programme, threatened to bomb Iran if diplomacy fails.

Anti-Trump protests expected in US today

Kira Lerner

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.

MoveOn, one of the organizations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labor, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

“This is shaping up to be the biggest single-day protest in the last several years of American history,” Ezra Levin, a founder of Indivisible, one of the groups planning the event, said on a recent organizing call.

The largest event is expected to be on the National Mall in Washington DC, where members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, are scheduled to speak to crowds.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most U.S. trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S. duty-free.

This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34% on all U.S. goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan told public broadcaster RTHK, however, Hong Kong would not impose separate countermeasures, citing the need for the city to remain “free and open”.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said:

The market has spoken.

Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, says he is prepared to dance if it means sidestepping some of the worst of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Last week he sent a letter to India’s president, Droupadi Murmu, urging her to join him in a tango to celebrate 75 years of ­bilateral trade.

Xi said it was “the right choice” for the two countries to be “partners of mutual achievement and realise the ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’”, which, he added, “fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples.”

Beijing is on a wide-ranging charm offensive, aimed at redirecting its exports away from the US to other willing destinations as Washington erects trade barriers.

Tariffs on China imposed by the US president amounting to 20% earlier this year were more than doubled last week to 54% and an effective average rate of 65%, raising the cost of Chinese imports to a level that many analysts believe will be uncompetitive.

The response from Beijing was swift. A sell-off on financial markets intensified after China’s finance ministry said it would respond in kind, adding 34% to the tariff on all US goods from 10 April.

Investors worry that a recession in the US cannot be ruled out as the trade war intensifies and companies hunker down, cutting investment and jobs to weather the storm.

John Denton, head of the International Chambers of Commerce, likens the onset of these tariff wars to the oil shock of the 1970s, such is its seismic importance. “The overriding theme is the battle for supremacy between China and the US for global trade dominance,” he said.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs.

The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people,” the ministry said, according to Reuters.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Jaguar Land Rover will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of president Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, according to a report in the Times newspaper.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters on Saturday.

A pause in shipments would add to fears over the impact from tariffs on the UK’s car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly. The US is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20% share, data from industry body SMMT shows, reports Reuters.

Jaguar Land Rover, one of the UK’s biggest producers by volume, sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually. Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales.

The US 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April. The previous day, Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe, upending world trade.

The Times said that Jaguar Land Rover is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests, reports Reuters.

President Donald Trump announced across-the-board import tariffs on Wednesday with much higher duties for dozens of trading partners, including Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the US and is facing a 32% duty on its products. The US tariffs, however, do not apply to semiconductors, a major Taiwanese export.

Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

Lai “hopes to give industry the greatest support, stabilise the economic situation, ensure Taiwan’s industry’s global competitiveness, and safeguard our country’s national interests and the continued steady progress of our economy”, Kuo said.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an important supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on whether it attended the meeting. TSMC is in its quiet period ahead of first quarter earnings announcement on 17 April.

On Friday, Taiwan’s government announced T$88bn ($2.67bn/£2.07bn) in financial help for companies and industries to deal with the impact of the US tariffs.

Taiwan, which says the tariffs are unreasonable, has said it will discuss them with the US and has not announced any retaliatory tariffs.

US president Donald Trump has long been an advocate of tariffs – once describing them as the most beautiful word in the dictionary – and his promise to impose them was a central plank of his presidential election campaign. In anticipation, Downing Street developed a defensive strategy that revolved around building a strong relationship with Trump’s White House – despite clear political differences – and launching talks to strike an economic deal that would secure tariff exemptions.

Trade talks between the UK and US began soon after Trump’s inauguration, before the prime minister visited Washington in February, with the goal of agreeing a relatively narrow deal focused on advanced technologies. Talks intensified before UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ own visit to meet Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, just over two weeks ago.

UK officials were assured by their US counterparts that they were in a strong position to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. “By then we knew what the faultlines were, and we were broadly there, so we just had some details to thrash out,” an official said.

The two key figures leading the negotiations are Reynolds and Varun Chandra, a corporate strategist turned senior No 10 aide known as the prime minister’s “business whisperer”. Officials have been impressed by how Chandra has navigated the US administration. “He just gets them, and they get him. The talks have been much more corporate in tone than trade negotiations usually are. That’s his world,” one said.

A senior trade department official, Kate Joseph, and Keir Starmer’s economic international affairs adviser, Michael Ellam, have been working behind the scenes at home to get the Whitehall machine ready. Multiple scenarios were drawn up depending on what tariff regime Trump imposed.

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.97%.

For the most recent quarter, U.S. Bancorp was expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, but it reported $1.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.94%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1 per share, while it actually produced $1.03 per share, a surprise of 3%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For U.S. Bancorp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

U.S. Bancorp has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 16, 2025.

With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Big banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley all report results on Friday, April 11.

The consumer price index report on Thursday will give the latest numbers on inflation.

After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods. Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

Money Report

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

""Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,"" Cramer said.

Our priorities

Best-in-class businesses

Strong integrated capabilities

Leading digital strategy and tech-enabled simplicity and efficiency

Disciplined capital stewardship

Message from Our Executive Chair, Our Chief Executive Officer and Our Lead Independent Director

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

Our aspiration is to be the leading and most trusted health care company in America. We believe this is possible because of the businesses we have, the strategy we are executing, and most importantly, our colleagues who serve 185 million people across our country.

Our integrated model allows us to deliver greater access, simpler experiences, lower costs and better outcomes. In short, we are uniquely positioned to provide the things people want the most from health care.

Financial performance

We are confident that the changes made in 2024 have set CVS Health® on a strong path for the future. We took decisive actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our Aetna® business, continued to implement our innovative and transparent pharmacy models, increased our focus on operational excellence and enhanced our leadership team. In 2024, we delivered $372.8 billion in revenue, generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow and returned nearly $3.4 billion to stockholders.

Maximizing value

Our ongoing commitment to driving innovation and integrating our businesses creates value for patients, members, customers and stockholders. In 2024, we made significant progress with our industry-first pharmacy models, CVS CostVantage™ and CVS Caremark TrueCost™. In addition, Cordavis™ contributed to net client savings of almost $1 billion by redefining the biosimilar drug marketplace. Our integrated teams helped Aetna achieve exceptional Star Ratings, with 88% of our Medicare Advantage members in 4-Star plans or higher.

Technology at the foundation

Technology helps create exceptional experiences for our consumers while simplifying how our colleagues work. We redesigned our CVS Health app in January 2025 to seamlessly connect users to our services and to the care they need - all in one place. Our clinicians can use artificial intelligence to summarize case notes, which frees up their time to engage with patients more deeply. Through the strategic and responsible use of technology, we are streamlining and connecting experiences for the millions of people we serve.

Management updates

Our management team and Board of Directors work together on the advancement of the Company's strategic plan. We proactively engage with stockholders to enhance our understanding and to be responsive to your perspectives and preferences.

We made key leadership team updates in 2024 to drive focused execution of our strategy, including David's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") and Roger's appointment as Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Prem Shah was appointed Group President, CVS Health. In this newly created role, Prem is responsible for operational performance and integrated value creation across our CVS Caremark®, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Health Care Delivery businesses. Steve Nelson also joined the leadership team as the newly appointed President of Aetna, bringing deep expertise leading managed care and health care delivery companies. Steve is working closely with David to build on and accelerate the plan to improve performance at Aetna. In addition, Heidi Capozzi was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer leading the human resources, labor relations, compensation and benefits and corporate social responsibility teams.

i

Board changes

We made a number of changes to our Board, including naming Mike Mahoney as Lead Independent Director to help provide dynamic Board leadership while maintaining strong independent oversight. We also enhanced our highly qualified Board with the appointment of four new directors, Leslie Norwalk, Larry Robbins, Guy Sansone and Doug Shulman, further sharpening our ability to achieve our bold ambitions. They bring skills that complement those of other Board members, including significant proficiency in health care, health services and other regulated industries, as well as areas corresponding to the evolution of our business.

We'd like to express our gratitude to J.P. Millon, who is retiring in May after having served on our Board since March 2007. J.P.'s extensive background in the pharmacy benefit management, pharmaceutical and life sciences businesses has been instrumental in the growth of the Company, and we wish him well in his future endeavors. We also acknowledge the many contributions of Nancy-Ann DeParle and Mary Schapiro, who have provided over eleven years and eight years, respectively, of diligent service to the Board and are not standing for re-election this year. Nancy-Ann has chaired our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for the past five years as our Board and management team has been updated, and her experience as the ""health care czar"" under President Obama has made her an invaluable member of the Health Services and Technology Committee since it was formed in 2016. Mary's background as the former Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA"") has made her a vital contributor to our Audit Committee, as well as our Investment and Finance Committee during its separate existence in the key years following the Aetna merger. We thank both Nancy-Ann and Mary and wish them the best in the future.

We will host our Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually at 8:00 a.m. ET on May 15, 2025 to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of location. As a stockholder, your vote is important to us and we encourage you to vote at your earliest convenience.

GES reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While net sales increased, earnings decreased from the year-ago period. Sales growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of rag & bone (concluded in April 2024), alongside modest gains in GES’ core operations.

The company is optimistic about growth opportunities across its core Guess brand, the newly launched Guess Jeans line and the acquisition of rag & bone. GES plans to improve overall profitability by sharpening its global direct-to-consumer strategy and streamlining business portfolio. These strategic moves are expected to contribute to a $30 million boost in operating profit by fiscal 2027.

GES’ Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

GES posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. However, the bottom line declined 26.4% from $2.01 reported in the prior-year period.

Guess?, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Guess?, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Guess?, Inc. Quote

Net revenues were $932.3 million, rising 4.6% year over year and surpassing the consensus mark of $899 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, net revenues rose 9%. The strong performance was driven by the rag & bone acquisition and positive momentum in the wholesale businesses across Europe and the Americas, and higher licensing revenues. All operating segments contributed to revenue growth, with the exception of the Asia segment, which saw a decline.

Gross margin contracted to 44.1% from 45.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 32.8% from 29.1% in the prior-year quarter.

Adjusted earnings from operations were $106.5 million, down 18.2% from $130.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, down from 14.6% reported in the same quarter last year. This downtick was mainly caused by increased expenses, higher advertising and store-related costs, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses. These pressures were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation.

Decoding GES’ Segmental Performance

Revenues in the Americas Retail segment rose 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% at cc. However, retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, declined 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% at cc. The operating margin in the segment was 8.9%, down 6.1% year over year. This decline was caused by the adverse effects of negative comparable sales, higher expenses and increased markdowns.

Americas Wholesale revenues soared 63% on a reported basis and 69% at cc. The segment’s operating margin fell to 12.8%, down 15.7% year over year due to the impact of newly acquired businesses and lower product margin.

The Europe segment’s revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 7% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) remained relatively flat on a reported basis and increased 5% at cc. The segmental operating margin was 15.4%, down 2.6% year over year, due to higher expenses and the impact of newly acquired businesses. This was partially offset by lower markdowns.

Asia revenues decreased 15% on a reported basis and 11% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) dropped 16% and 11% on a reported basis and at cc, respectively. The operating margin in the segment was 1.3%, down 3.5% year over year. This downside was primarily due to lower product margins and reduced revenues.

Licensing revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and at cc. Segmental operating margin was 94.8% compared with 92.7% in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by lower expenses.

GES’ Financial Health Snapshot & Shareholder-Friendly Moves

The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $187.7 million and long-term debt and finance lease obligations of nearly $150.7 million. Stockholders’ equity was around $505 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2025, was $121.7 million. Free cash flow for the same period amounted to $29.8 million. For fiscal 2026, free cash flow is expected to be $55 million.

GES announced a quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on May 2, 2025, to its shareholders on record as of April 16.

The company repurchased about 2.6 million shares for $60.3 million during fiscal 2025.

What to Expect From GES in the Future?

For fiscal 2026, Guess? anticipates revenues to grow of 3.9-6.2%.

The adjusted operating margin is expected to be 4.5-5.4%. The GAAP operating margin is likely to be 4.3-5.2%.

Management expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32-$1.76 in fiscal 2026 compared with the $1.96 recorded in fiscal 2025. On a GAAP basis, EPS is envisioned in the range of $1.03-$1.37 compared with the 77 cents reported in fiscal 2025.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management expects revenue growth of 5.8-7.5%. On an adjusted basis, Guess? expects to post a loss of 74-65 cents per share. On a GAAP basis, it expects to deliver a loss in the range of 75-66 cents per share.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 29.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 30.5% decline.

The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).
“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%.
Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%.
The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.","New figures released from climate change NGO Opportunity Green claim profits on an “extraordinary scale” have been made by leading shipping companies in the years since the pandemic.

The world’s 139 largest shipping companies – accounting for 90% of the world’s fleet – made almost US$340.0Bn in profits from 2019-2023, the last year for which full figures are available. Of this sum, 93% was taken by the top 10 largest companies, the report says.

“The pandemic created an enormous windfall for shipping companies as the easing of lockdown restrictions caused a spike in global demand for freight, pushing prices up to record levels. But freight prices have soared again since 2023, as a result of disruptions to global shipping routes including drought restrictions on the Panama Canal and attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea. As freight prices have risen, so have shipping company profits,” the report said.

It added, “Yet despite these record earnings, shipping company taxes have remained catastrophically low and many of the world’s biggest shipping companies are failing to pay their fair share of taxes.”

It said the top 10 largest companies paid only US$30.0Bn in tax from 2019-2023, at a tax rate of around 10%. The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).

“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%. The report shows the problem is biggest in the largest and most profitable companies, with nine of the top 10 from high income developed economies and four of those headquartered in wealthy OECD member states. Over 2019-2023, members of the OECD have an average tax rate on shipping companies of around 4%, compared with a rest of the world average of 16%.”

A statement said, “The top three publicly listed European shipping companies, Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag Lloyd, paid only $4.6Bn in taxes in total over five years, despite making nearly half of all profits globally (US$137.0Bn). Had the top 10 largest shipping companies paid the average rate of tax faced by other companies in their home countries, the additional tax raised would have been US$42.0Bn.”

Economics at Opportunity Green senior director James Meadway said, “This is a shameful set of statistics, and shipping companies must change course, start paying their fair share of taxes and get on board with the true impact their operations are having on the planet. The international shipping sector is a significant contributor to climate change, producing 1Bn tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, but nowhere is this felt more acutely than in the Global South, where frontline countries are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%. If these four companies alone were taxed at the same rate as other big corporations where they are headquartered, more than US$38.0Bn extra in taxes would have been raised over those five years.”

Opportunity Green chief executive and founder Aoife O’Leary said, “These figures should act as a stark warning as member states from all over the globe gather at the International Maritime Organization to discuss the possibility of a levy on international shipping emissions. The shipping industry currently produces 1Bn tonnes of GHG emissions each year, and yet it continues to dodge paying fair taxes. It now has the unique chance to put that right by becoming the first industry to introduce a global levy and raise revenues that could be directed to deal with the worst of climate change in climate vulnerable countries.”

The top 10 largest shipping companies are Moller-Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, China COSCO, Ocean Network Express, Evergreen Marine Corp, Orient Overseas, Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp, Wan Hai Lines and SITC.

A statement said all 10 companies were contacted for their responses to the figures in the report. Of these, Wan Hai Lines, Maersk and Orient Overseas responded to confirm the figures provided about their company are accurate. No replies were received from the remaining top 10 companies. The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/152/Hapag_Lloyd_Berlin_Express_web_Main.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 13:09:03.379623

Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 11, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.5%.

Revenues are expected to be $4.74 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon?

For The Bank of New York Mellon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.49%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.72, delivering a surprise of +10.26%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Bank of New York Mellon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

ELV is a health benefits company offering a wide range of medical, pharmacy, and healthcare services across its four segments: Health Benefits, CarelonRx, Carelon Services, and Corporate & Other. It provides health plans, specialty insurance, pharmacy solutions, and healthcare management services under brands such as Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Wellpoint, and Carelon.

The Indianapolis, Indiana-based company is expected to release its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings results before the market opens on Tuesday, Apr. 22. Ahead of this event, analysts expect ELV to report a profit of $10.97 per share, up 3.1% from $10.64 per share in the prior year's quarter. It has surpassed Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in three of the past four quarters while missing on another occasion. In Q4 2024, Elevance Health exceeded the consensus EPS estimate by 1.1%.

For fiscal 2025, analysts forecast ELV to post EPS of $34.17, reflecting a 3.4% increase from $33.04 in fiscal 2024. Looking ahead, EPS is projected to grow 14.2% year-over-year to $39.02 in fiscal 2026.

ELV has underperformed the broader markets over the past 52 weeks, with shares down 8.1%, compared to the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 1.9% gain and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLV) marginal dip over the same period.

Despite reporting better-than-expected Q4 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.84 and operating revenues of around $45 billion on Jan. 23, shares of ELV fell marginally the next day. Adjusted EPS fell 31.7% year-over-year, and the Health Benefits segment saw a 75% plunge in operating gain, with operating margin shrinking by 150 basis points. Medical membership declined 2% to 45.7 million, missing estimates, largely due to Medicaid disenrollment. Rising total expenses and a drop in net investment income added further strain to the bottom line.

Moreover, management projected weaker margins for both the Health Benefits and Carelon Services segments in fiscal 2025, tempering investor sentiment.

Analysts' consensus rating on ELV stock is bullish, with a ""Strong Buy"" rating overall. Out of 20 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 ""Strong Buys,” one ""Moderate Buy,"" and four ""Holds.” The average analyst price target for ELV is $491.37, suggesting a potential upside of 10.8% from current levels.

The big US banks kick off what is likely to be an interesting corporate earnings season in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs and the heightened sense of economic uncertainty. Trump’s ‘reciprocal’ levies announcement on Wednesday sent the S&P 500 4.8% lower on Thursday, its biggest one-day drop since Covid in 2020.

Also coming up are the March readings of the US consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Inflation could rise in the future if the tariff-induced increases in import costs are passed on to US consumers, though it may take time for the full impact of the tariffs to show up in the CPI and PPI data.

In the UK, meanwhile, February GDP data out on Friday could shed light on whether the Bank of England’s recent interest rate cuts are helping to boost growth. Policymakers cut rates in August 2024 (from 5.25% to 5%), in November (to 4.75%) and again in February 2025 (to the current rate of 4.5%).

US March CPI

Thursday 10 April

Analysts estimate that US CPI rose 2.5% in the year to March, easing from 2.8% in February. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have increased 3% year-on-year, down from 3.1% in February. On a monthly basis, headline CPI is thought to have increased 0.2%, with core CPI up 0.3%.

On Friday, PPI is expected to come in at 3%, down from 3.2% in February. Analysts use the CPI and PPI readings to estimate the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the next reading of which is due out later this month.

Trump’s tariffs have changed the outlook for US inflation, which may be set to rise if importers pass on higher costs to consumers. Should the March inflation figures come in higher than expected, the inflation outlook could deteriorate even further. Implementing the tariffs on top of hot inflation data might raise fears of stagflation – a combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. In that scenario, the US dollar might continue to weaken, potentially benefiting the Japanese yen. Having broken below support at ¥147 on Thursday, USD/JPY could be on its way towards the next key support area near ¥142.

UK February GDP

Friday 11 April

After the UK economy unexpectedly shrank 0.1% month-on-month in January, down from a 0.4% increase in December, economists estimate that gross domestic product grew 0.1% in February. With growth tepid, and given that the market turmoil brought on by Trump’s tariffs could run into a second week, the GDP report may not significantly affect the pound.

The pound looks slightly overextended, with GBP/USD having tested resistance near $1.32 on Thursday before slipping back to $1.297. That said, if the pound benefits from further dollar weakness, the pair could strengthen back above $1.30. If GBP/USD clears $1.31, then $1.342 may become the next upside target.

JPMorgan Chase Q1 earnings

Friday 11 April

BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are among the US financial heavyweights kicking off a fresh US earnings season on Friday, but JPMorgan will be the one to watch. Analysts expect the largest US bank by assets to report that first-quarter earnings grew 3.7% year-on-year to $4.60 a share. Revenue is forecast to have increased 3.4% to $43.98bn. Looking ahead to Q2, analysts forecast earnings of $4.57 a share on revenue of $44bn. The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.

The JPMorgan share price closed at $228.69 on Thursday, down 18% from the February high, following a rocky few weeks. The chart below shows the emergence of a possible head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below support at $224 could confirm the pattern. If that support level breaks, the stock might slide to around $205.

Valued at a market cap of $385.1 billion, the company boasts a broad portfolio of drugs covering a wide range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular & metabolism, immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and infectious diseases and vaccines. It is expected to announce its fiscal Q1 earnings for 2025 before the market opens on Tuesday, Apr. 15.

Prior to this event, analysts project this healthcare giant to report a profit of $2.59 per share, down 4.4% from $2.71 per share in the year-ago quarter.

For the full year, analysts expect JNJ to report EPS of $10.58, up 6% from $9.98 in fiscal 2024. Its EPS is expected to further grow 4.6% year over year to $11.07 in fiscal 2026.

JNJ has aligned with the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 3.6% gains over the past 52 weeks, although it has outpaced the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) marginal decline over the same time frame.

On Apr. 1, JNJ’s shares closed down 7.6% after a Texas bankruptcy judge dismissed the company's latest attempt to settle thousands of lawsuits. The lawsuits allege that J&J's baby powder and other talc-based products caused ovarian cancer. The court ruling was a major setback for the company, contributing to the sharp decline in its stock price.

On Jan. 22, JNJ released its Q4 results. It delivered adjusted EPS of $2.04 and revenue of $22.5 billion, which surpassed Wall Street estimates. Moreover, its revenue improved 5.3% from the year-ago quarter due to a rise in sales across both its reportable segments. Despite these positives, its shares plunged 1.9% on the day of the release. What disappointed investors the most was its underwhelming fiscal 2025 sales guidance. The company expects revenue in the range of $89.2 billion and $90 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates. Additionally, while its adjusted earnings exceeded expectations, it declined 10.9% compared to the prior-year quarter, further weighing on investor sentiment.

Wall Street analysts are moderately optimistic about JNJ’s stock, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating overall. Among 22 analysts covering the stock, eight recommend ""Strong Buy,"" two suggest “Moderate Buy,” and 12 advise “Hold.” The mean price target for JNJ is $169.18 which indicates a 5.9% potential upside from the current levels.

In September last year, Starbucks Chief Brian Niccol launched his ""Back to Starbucks"" campaign, which was slated to go into full swing in 2025, to counter declining sales and foot traffic at the renowned chain.

Ultimately, the Seattle-rooted coffee giant has expressed an eagerness to reclaim its reputation as the quintessential ""third place,"" a sanctuary aside from home and the office. Niccol proudly shared, ""I'm happy to say the third place is alive and well. It's as needed as it ever was.""

Perhaps the most notable change has been the menu updates. Last month, Starbucks told USA TODAY that it has revamped and scaled down its menu offerings to ""help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company.""

The company said it's trimming its menu by a whopping 30 percent. The initial phase of these reductions commenced in February. Starbucks clarified that the cuts would affect items that ""aren't commonly purchased, can be complex to make, or are similar to other beverages on the menu."" Choices like the Iced Matcha Lemonade, Java Chip Frappuccino, White Hot Chocolate and Honey Almondmilk Flat White were already cut.

Starbucks also said they are shaking things up with new store designs being trialed in various U.S. spots. ""We're working hard to ensure our coffee houses have the right vibe,"" Niccol said.

The coffee giant has reintroduced condiment bars, started serving drinks in ceramic mugs, and encouraged baristas to personalize cups with Sharpies. It's also broadened its free refill policy, now allowing more patrons to enjoy a second cup on the house than ever before.

Previously, only Starbucks Rewards members could snag a free refill, but that's changed. Now, any customer who orders a hot or iced coffee or tea for dine-in can request a refill during their visit at no extra cost at participating stores.

Earlier in the year, Starbucks revisited its restroom policy, now asking customers to purchase something before using the facilities or lounge in the café.

""Imagine coffee houses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays,"" Niccols envisioned.

He further explained: ""Stores with more separation between the café and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive handoff, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater to the experience and enhances the connection between our baristas and our customers.""

Niccol stated that the company also aims to deliver ""a high-quality beverage in four minutes or less with a moment of connection.""

In December 2024, Starbucks hinted at working on changes to make in-app and mobile orders more efficient, improving ""transparency and simplicity."" A few months later, Niccol announced that mobile ordering would now be limited to up to 12 items per order to decrease wait times.",https://i2-prod.irishstar.com/incoming/article34980843.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2196750077.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 14:10:33.359744

Starbucks India plans aggressive expansion of its store count despite facing losses since its entry into the market with Tata Group 12 years ago. The company focuses on various store formats and intends to strengthen its presence amid growing competition. Revenue growth has slowed down to 12% in FY24, while losses have tripled.

Starbucks India said it will aggressively expand their store count, despite running in losses. The coffee chain entered India 12 years ago with a joint venture with the Tata Group.

Sushant Dash, CEO, Starbucks India says ""We are focussing on store count expansion. And when you are doing that, it requires investment. And that has an impact on the bottom line.""

As of September 2024, the company has a new global CEO, Brian Niccol who took on the role after Laxman Narasimhan, who held the position since March 2023 and was replaced amid declining sales and stock prices, last September.

The current strategy of the company for India remains the same as it was under Narasimhan’s regime, Dash said. The company intends to continue to focus on arabica coffee, localized menus, store formats and store counts.

The total store count for the brand in India stands at 487. Out of these, 8 stores are drive-throughs. Majority of the drive-through stores for the brand are in Punjab.

Live Events

Dash adds, “India in terms of growth is amongst the top four markets for Starbucks, and we plan on increasing our store presence focusing on various store formats, like we have been doing.”

The coffee retail competition in India has been brewing steadily with UK based Pret A Manger entering India in April 2023, in a franchise agreement with Reliance Brands Limited, with plans to open 100 stores in five years.

Domestic competitor Third Wave Coffee crossed 100 outlets in India as of last year.

Starbucks India’s revenue growth slowed down to 12% in FY24, with revenue from operations at Rs 1,218.1 crore, and its losses increased three times at Rs 80 crore.

ID35,Starbucks,2025-04-04 11:30:26+00:00,Yahoo Finance,New Starbucks CEO Brian Nicoll was already worried about high prices. Now tariffs have ...,Lila MacLellan,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-ceo-brian-nicoll-already-090000012.html,"But the top reason customers say they’re going to Starbucks less often is its high prices, according to recent research from Deutsche Bank analysts.
Starbucks imports coffee from more than 30 countries, including Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariffs at 46%.
As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.
How Starbucks could weather the storm Indeed, the fear of a recession is one reason that Starbucks share prices sank yesterday, says Danilo Gargiulo, an equity research analyst for Bernstein.
In the 2008 crisis, he explains, Starbucks was one of the brands hardest hit by reduced consumer spending.","Since Brian Niccol took over as the CEO of Starbucks last fall, he has made a slew of moves to start bringing customers back to the company's stores and reverse slumping sales. He has vowed to reduce wait times for service, and he simplified the shop's menu, while encouraging in-store customers to linger over ceramic mugs.

But the top reason customers say they’re going to Starbucks less often is its high prices, according to recent research from Deutsche Bank analysts. And controlling prices may have just gotten a lot more difficult for Niccol.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, placing high taxes on imports from dozens of countries and a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S. The president hopes his drastic actions will nudge businesses to buy supplies from American producers and make products in the U.S.. For coffee retailers like Starbucks, however, the levies will be impossible to dodge given that less than 1% of coffee consumed in the country is made domestically.

Starbucks imports coffee from more than 30 countries, including Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariffs at 46%.

As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.

A price freeze promise

Starbucks did not respond to Fortune's request for comment. But the company's former CFO acknowledged in an earnings call earlier this year that higher prices for coffee could impact revenue and profitability for the retail giant and its “already pressured consumer.”

The coffee company has angered customers in recent years by steeply raising prices as inflation rose in the U.S. The chief executive has already assigned himself a challenging task: he plans to invest in stores and employees as part of his turnaround plan, but has also committed to a price freeze through fiscal year 2025. So what now?

“Starbucks is either going to have lower margins and keep the prices where they are, or they'll be forced to raise prices,” says Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.

If trade wars lead to steeper prices for a wide range of products, or push the U.S. into a recession, some Starbucks customers who currently pick up pricey drinks once or twice a week “may decide that they do not need that as much as they need to pay their rent or pay for health insurance,” Cohan adds. He predicts Starbucks will see fewer store visits, meaning lower sales of coffee, food, and non-coffee based drinks.

The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy.
The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.
While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive.
The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth.","According to a report from Moody’s, a global credit ratings, research, and risk analysis firm, Europe’s four largest primary insurers—Allianz, AXA, Generali, and Zurich Insurance —have reported record earnings for FY 2024, collectively reaching €28.6 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year.

Moody’s attributes these strong results to solid performances across all key divisions, with property and casualty (P&C) insurance and life and health (L&H) segments driving much of the growth.

The continued success in these sectors highlights the insurers’ robust positions in the market and their ability to navigate challenging economic environments.

The insurers demonstrated significant premium gains across both P&C and L&H sectors, with P&C premiums rising by 9% and L&H premiums increasing by 14%.

Moody’s emphasised that these increases were driven by price hikes and greater exposure, particularly in retail insurance. The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy. While the insurers exceeded their earnings targets for 2024, Moody’s expects slower profit growth in 2025, influenced by rising geopolitical risks and market uncertainties.

The P&C business was particularly strong in 2024, buoyed by both retail and commercial lines. Premium revenue, particularly in retail insurance, significantly boosted underwriting results, as insurers continued adjusting prices to respond to inflation in claims costs.

Allianz and Zurich were among those reporting improvements in their commercial combined ratios. Despite this, commercial pricing momentum showed some signs of slowing down, especially in certain markets. However, retail P&C lines saw significant improvement across most European regions.

Moody’s noted that the L&H business rebounded in 2024, showing growth after a slower 2023. This was driven by higher releases from the contractual service margin (CSM) and improved technical margins.

The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.

While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive. New business in the L&H sector grew by an average of 17% across the four companies, with Allianz and Generali seeing particularly strong results—up 20% and 30%, respectively. This growth was fuelled by a diverse mix of protection and savings products tailored to market demands.

According to Moody’s, the insurers reported stable solvency ratios, supported by strong capital generation. However, substantial shareholder returns, including dividends and share buybacks, partly offset these gains.

Despite a solid capital foundation, the insurers remain committed to progressive dividend policies, which may limit financial flexibility in times of economic stress. Moody’s also highlighted that their cautious outlook for capital management in 2025 could be influenced by rising geopolitical tensions and volatile financial markets.

Moody’s also pointed out the value of geographical diversification in strengthening these insurers’ positions. Allianz, AXA, and Generali have established dominant positions in their home markets (Germany, France, and Italy, respectively), while maintaining significant footprints across Europe and other regions.

Zurich, with its focus on P&C and commercial lines, has a strong presence in North America. This geographical spread has helped mitigate risks from natural catastrophes and has been instrumental in diversifying earnings.

While investment returns in 2024 were robust, buoyed by healthy interest rates and stable financial markets, the outlook for investment results in 2025 is more uncertain.

Moody’s indicated that rising geopolitical risks and potential market volatility could impact investment performance. The mixed outlook for investments is an area of concern as insurers must navigate broader market uncertainty, including potential economic slowdowns.

Looking ahead to 2025, Moody’s expects slower profit growth, though P&C performance is expected to continue benefiting from price increases and exposure growth.

However, the momentum in commercial pricing is likely to slow. The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth. In contrast, Allianz and Generali, with their focus on long-term life savings, appear better positioned for growth in this area.

Despite these challenges, Moody’s believes that the insurers remain well-positioned for further market share expansion. Their diverse portfolios, strong capital management, and geographical spread provide a solid foundation for the future.",https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/moodys-logo-new.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:22:13.287636

Despite the highly challenging global economic and business environment, UBA recorded a profit before tax of US$539.388 million representing a 6.1 percent increase from US$508.490 million recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year.
Consequently, UBA Group Shareholders’ Funds rose from US$1,310.523 billion as at December 2023 to close the 2024 financial year at US$2,207.230 billion, achieving an impressive growth of 68.39 percent.

The 2024 financials, filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGx) on Monday, showed an impressive rise in the bank’s profit after tax which went up by 26.14 percent to close the year at US$514.476 million, up from US$ 407.836 million recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.

The Bank’s gross earnings also grew significantly from US$13,959 billion recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year to US$21,409 billion in the period under consideration, representing a 53.6 percent growth.

Like in the previous years, the banks’ total assets also rose remarkably by 46.8 percent, from US$133,312 trillion in 2023, to close at US$196, 256 trillion in December 2024; signifying a milestone leap for the bank with the largest spread across the continent.

Despite the highly challenging global economic and business environment, UBA recorded a profit before tax of US$539.388 million representing a 6.1 percent increase from US$508.490 million recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year.

Consequently, UBA Group Shareholders’ Funds rose from US$1,310.523 billion as at December 2023 to close the 2024 financial year at US$2,207.230 billion, achieving an impressive growth of 68.39 percent.

As a result of the impressive performance and in fulfilment of the promise made by the UBA Group Chairman, Tony Elumelu, to shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting, the Bank proposed a final dividend of US$0.0019 for every ordinary share of US$ 0.0032, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024. This brings the total dividend in the year to US$0.0032 The final dividend is subject to the ratification of the shareholders during its upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).

UBA’s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Alawuba, who expressed excitement at the results, stated that the 2024 financial performance demonstrates the bank’s continued focus on driving earnings growth, preserving asset quality, expanding business operations and deepening market share.

“Our continued investment in our highly diversified global network allows UBA to deliver high-quality, consistent earnings. Our businesses have been able to grow product and service income and expand our deposit base, allowing the Group to increase earnings while maintaining strong spreads and margins,” Alawuba highlighted.

According to him, “With total deposit increasing by 42.03 percent from US$11,233.054 billion in 2023 to US$15.946 billion and total assets hitting US$19.626 billion from US$19.819 billion, the just-released results reflect broad-based growth across all core businesses and were achieved despite prevailing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainties, and exchange rate volatilities.”

The GMD expressed excitement at the marked improvement recorded in the bank’s core earnings profile, as he explained that the profit is derived from high-quality income streams from funding intermediation, fees, and commissions, thus reflecting strong long-term, sustainable revenue generation capacity.

“Our ex-Nigeria (Rest of Africa & International) operations have expanded significantly over the past five years, now contributing 51.7% of Group revenue, up from 31% in 2019, delivering diversification benefits and further boosting long-term shareholder value. This will continue to grow, as we further explore strategic markets that align with our overall vision. We are currently upgrading our business scope and authorization in France, and considering other viable markets in the short to medium term,” Alawuba noted.

He pointed out the bank’s resolve to invest continuously in technology, data analytics, product innovation, staff training and development, which, according to him, will collectively enhance our customers’ experience.

On his part, UBA’s Executive Director, Finance & Risk Management, Ugo Nwaghodoh, said the bank recorded triple-digit growth in net interest income, resulting in remarkable improvement in net interest margin from 6.83 percent in 2023 to 9.02 percent, while also recording strong double-digit growth in fee and commission income lines of 91.66 percent.

“UBA Group continues to demonstrate strong capital levels, with shareholders’ funds’ growth of 68.4% to US$2.208 billion and a solid capital adequacy ratio of 31.0%., and as we defensibly position the portfolio to navigate prevailing global and regional macroeconomic upheavals, asset quality improved, with NPL ratio moderating to 5.58%, with strong provision coverage at 81%”, Nwaghodoh noted.

He explained that as the bank navigates evolving risks, its management remains focused on responsible growth, delivering customer-focused value propositions, whilst ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions.

According to the rights issue circular, the terms include six new ordinary shares for every share held by existing shareholders.
Together, we will continue to brew success, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and create a future with more cheers,” said Finance Director of International Breweries David Tomlinson.
This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt.
The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.","International Breweries has seen its loss after tax extended to the seventh year, as it recorded an N113bn loss in the 2024 financial year.

According to its audited financial report filed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited on Thursday, the brewer saw its loss worsen to N113.61bn from N70.03bn in 2023, marking a 62.25 per cent rise.

International Breweries had been on a losing streak since the 2018 financial year when it recorded a loss of N3.87bn, which grew to N27.79bn in 2019 and dipped to N16.08bn in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose to N17.66bn in 2021 and higher to N21.63bn in 2022.

However, in the 2024 financial year, the company’s revenue reached a nine-year high of N488.96bn. Compared to the previous year’s revenue of N260.59bn, this was an 87.63 per cent jump year-on-year, indicating strong revenue growth.

Highlighting some of its challenges, the brewer in its annual report said, “While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacted profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure.

The company generated positive operating cash flows in the current year, 2024: N148.90bn (2023: N78.60bn) to cover its short-term obligations. The company is strategically positioned for success in the future and continues to have the backing of its ultimate parent company.”

International Breweries opened its N588bn rights issue programme in May 2024. The brewer sought to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of two kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share. According to the rights issue circular, the terms include six new ordinary shares for every share held by existing shareholders.

It later expanded the offering to allow non-shareholders of the company to participate in its rights issue.

The brewer, which is a part of AB InBev, the largest brewer in the world, said at the time that the net proceeds from the rights issue would be used to settle its outstanding US dollar-denominated loan and provide working capital support.

“We are committed to creating sustainable value for our shareholders while fortifying our position in the Nigerian beverage industry. Together, we will continue to brew success, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and create a future with more cheers,” said Finance Director of International Breweries David Tomlinson.

Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller, then the world’s second-largest brewer, in 2016.

This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt. The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.

As of December 2024, AB InBev Nigeria Holdings BV holds 161,580,471,272, equating to 96.1 per cent of the shares of the brewer.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/12015234/International-Breweries-Plc.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 23:00:33.982297

Nike Inc. (NKE-14.02%) has submitted its 10-Q filing for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2025.

The filing includes financial statements for the quarter, showing a decrease in revenues to $11.3 billion from $12.4 billion in the same quarter the previous year. The decrease is attributed to lower revenues in key regions and product segments.

Gross margin for the quarter decreased by 330 basis points to 41.5%, primarily due to lower average selling prices and higher inventory obsolescence reserves.

Net income for the quarter was $794 million, down from $1,172 million in the previous year. Earnings per share were $0.54, compared to $0.77 in the previous year.

“Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection.
“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email.
“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email.
“But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game.","Forever 21’s downfall cannot be attributed to a single factor. Yet, the once iconic fast fashion retailer pointedly singled out the rise of the likes of Shein and Temu as a key driver behind its second bankruptcy.

If you ask experts, however, the company’s demise isn’t a story of a sole misstep, but rather a series of interconnected failures, which, while including rising competition, also stemmed from an inability to adapt to the quick changing economic environment, trend cycles, and consumer shopping patterns.

The retailer, which will be closing all 350 of its stores in the US, had faced eerily similar woes during its first bankruptcy in 2019: overexpansion without a well thought-out strategy, an inability to keep up with digital trends, declining product appeal, and overall concerns around sustainability.

But instead of addressing its core problems, modernizing operations, or significantly improving its e-commerce presence like its competitors Zara and H&M, it simply downsized and, well…hoped for the best.

“In the case of Forever 21, the reasons given by management were all known at the time of their first bankruptcy,” Greg Portell, senior partner and global markets lead at Kearney, told Retail Brew via email. “Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection. In the end, any company should expect competition and can benefit from working to anticipate those moves.”

Cue the sequel: Denise Green, director of graduate studies in Cornell University’s fiber science and apparel design program, pointed to the significant struggles the retailer had on the sustainability front—a mounting concern that has put all fast fashion brands under scrutiny.

While retailers like Zara and H&M have focused on increasing awareness around their sustainability efforts, however flawed, Forever 21 seemed to have paid very little heed to its low-cost, disposable model. It doesn’t help that mid-priced brands such as Reformation and Everlane also gained traction at the same time by offering more ethically produced alternatives.

“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email. “The company’s overexpansion and inefficient supply chain further exacerbated its financial woes.”

Ironically, Shein and Temu have faced even greater scrutiny over their ethics and sustainability practices, yet that hasn’t deterred their loyal customer base from the vast selection of ultra-cheap offerings on both platforms.

“Retailers like Shein and Temu pose a significant threat because of their more agile supply chains, which enable rapid response to consumer trends and their shifting preferences,” Green said. “Competing against them requires a multifaceted approach: investing in technology to equalize supply chain agility, prioritizing sustainability, and enhancing brand loyalty through storytelling and personalization.”

Sam Vise, CEO of Optimum Retailing, an AI-supported retail intelligence platform, offers an alternate point of view. While acknowledging that Shein and Temu pose a real threat to fast fashion brands, he said it’s not because of their “speed or low prices” but because of a unique understanding of their customer.

“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email. “But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game. The key is not to try and outprice Shein or Temu online; it’s to offer something they fundamentally can’t. When done right, brick-and-mortar stores create an emotionally resonant experience that can’t be replicated while scrolling on an app.”

Final word: Vise suggests the “real opportunity” to tackle the threat from the duo lies in combining the strengths of both digital and physical retail.

“The retailers that will thrive are the ones who view their physical footprint as a strategic advantage: a space where online meets offline, and where shoppers can see, feel, try, and immediately take home the products they’ve browsed digitally,” he said. “To stay competitive, traditional fast fashion brands need to reframe their stores not as distribution points, but as experience centers that are flexible, localized, and deeply in tune with the customer.”

If there’s one takeaway from Forever 21’s decline, it’s that survival in retail isn’t about sticking to what worked in the past, it’s about evolving.

For any retailer looking to learn from this second stumble, Portell believes it’s this: “If a retailer is going to seek bankruptcy protection or embark on a management-controlled restructuring, it is important to take the opportunity to fix the entirety of the problem.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cc30ee2912ec91ef5947d1a5ff219b967cef5b2b-5000x3335.jpg?rect=0,355,5000,2625&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-03 18:06:26.663112

The marketplace’s share within that has nearly doubled in just one year. The platform serves as a catalyst for growth for Decathlon, both in Germany and beyond.

Globally, Decathlon achieved a revenue of 16.2 billion euros last year. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 3.8 percent increase compared to the previous year.

Online revenue

Digital sales are becoming increasingly important for the French sporting goods retailer. Last year, 20 percent of its global revenue came from online sales, including ecommerce, in-store connected orders, and marketplaces – up from 17 percent in 2023. In Germany, however, the online share is significantly higher.

Decathlon sells billions of euros worth of products online

In its reports, Decathlon also emphasizes its focus on the importance of the planet and people. Despite sales growth, the company reduced its CO2 emissions last year. Additionally, it continues to employ more people, now with staff from 87 different nationalities. The proportion of women in the workforce has also increased.

Omnichannel strategy and marketplace

In a separate report on Germany, Decathlon attributes its positive revenue development to “the consistent implementation of its omnichannel strategy, which seamlessly integrates the digital and physical shopping experience”. The company also highlights “the remarkable development of the online marketplace”, which accounted for 20 percent of digital sales last year. For comparison: in 2023, this was 11 percent, and in 2022, just 7 percent.

German marketplace share has tripled since 2022

Given that Decathlon’s German marketplace has not been active for very long, its rapid growth is not surprising. However, platform sales are exceeding expectations. It has become a catalyst for further profitable online growth, much like what has been seen with online marketplaces of MediaMarkt, Zalando and Otto.

Gap Inc shares were down 22% in early trading on Thursday, while Levi's were down 11%.
(Home goods retailers, also very exposed to tariffs on Asian suppliers, similarly got dinged, with Restoration Hardware down 42%.)
Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.","At the Shoptalk retail industry conference last week, Gap Inc CEO Richard Dickson touted the apparel maker's limited exposure to China and the tariffs about to be imposed on imports from there after years of efforts to diversify its supplier base.

""Big credit goes to our supply chains. We've been working on diversifying our manufacturer footprint for quite some time. Less than 10% of our product is coming out of China,"" said Dickson. Now Gap's biggest supplier country is Vietnam, followed by India and Indonesia, all well ahead of China.

Dickson's counterpart at Levi Strauss & Co Michelle Gass echoed the reduced exposure to China at Shoptalk too, saying ""Of what we know today, right now it is fairly minimal.""

In recent years, many U.S. apparel makers have gradually reduced their reliance on China because of rising costs there, the abundance of capacity in Southeast Asia, and the threat of a trade conflict with the U.S. always looming.

But Dickson and Gass' sanguine reactions of course came before the Trump Administration's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to impose punitive tariffs on 60 countries, including across-the-board levies of 46% on imports from Vietnam and 26% from India. Suddenly, Gap Inc and Levi's don't seem inoculated at all from Trump's tariff war with the rest of the world.

Gap Inc shares were down 22% in early trading on Thursday, while Levi's were down 11%. Other apparel-heavy retailers saw big drops like Macy's, down 16%. (Home goods retailers, also very exposed to tariffs on Asian suppliers, similarly got dinged, with Restoration Hardware down 42%.)

When President Trump this winter announced his first salvos in the tariff wars, focused initially on China, Canada and Mexico, many retailers rushed to reassure investors that over time, they had lessened their exposure to China, long known as a maker of cheap items for Western brands. Target's Chief Commercial Officer said in March that Chinese goods now represent 30% of its merchandise, down from 60% in 2017. Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.

Ditto for Nike, which said in its most recent annual report that factories in Vietnam made half of the shoes it sells and more than a quarter of the apparel in Vietnam. The sportswear giant, trying to carry off a turnaround amid waning interest in its wares, saw its shares fall 15%.

(Reuters) -Conagra Brands missed Wall Street expectations for third-quarter sales and profit on Thursday, hurt by softening demand for its snacks and supply-chain disruptions in frozen food and refrigerated business.

The Slim Jim maker is facing a double whammy of slowing sales growth as budget-conscious Americans switch to cheaper private-label brands, and manufacturing challenges at one of its primary facility, which prepares and cooks chicken used in frozen meals, impacting its ability to meet demand.

“While shipments lagged consumption largely due to discrete supply constraints we announced in February, we are making solid progress in restoring inventory and improving customer service levels,” CEO Sean Connolly said.

The company’s overall volumes decreased 3.1% during the quarter, while average prices fell 2.1%.

Conagra has been cutting product prices and offering promotions to keep demand intact. But the company, along with some of its peers, has been facing slowing demand, mainly for snacks, in an uncertain economy.

General Mills, Kraft Heinz and Campbell’s have all issued bleak annual forecasts on strained consumer spending, which took a further hit after U.S. President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff decisions fanned worries of prices shooting up again.

“With national brands already experiencing a drop in demand, its (Conagra) supply-chain issues are salt in the wound,” said Emarketer analyst Blake Droesch.

“This puts the company in a vulnerable position heading into the rest of the year, where its challenges are likely to be compounded by the impact of tariffs.”

Conagra said it expects limited impact to fiscal 2025 from previously announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and imports from China. It also kept its annual forecasts unchanged.

Shares of the packaged food company rose 3.6% in early trading.

Conagra’s third-quarter net sales fell 6.3% to $2.84 billion. Analysts estimated $2.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, missing expectation of 53 cents.

(Reuters) -Conagra Brands missed Wall Street expectations for third-quarter sales and profit on Thursday, hurt by softening demand for its snacks and supply-chain disruptions in frozen food and refrigerated business.

The Slim Jim maker is facing a double whammy of slowing sales growth as budget-conscious Americans switch to cheaper private-label brands, and manufacturing challenges at one of its primary facility, which prepares and cooks chicken used in frozen meals, impacting its ability to meet demand.

""While shipments lagged consumption largely due to discrete supply constraints we announced in February, we are making solid progress in restoring inventory and improving customer service levels,"" CEO Sean Connolly said.

The company's overall volumes decreased 3.1% during the quarter, while average prices fell 2.1%.

Conagra has been cutting product prices and offering promotions to keep demand intact. But the company, along with some of its peers, has been facing slowing demand, mainly for snacks, in an uncertain economy.

General Mills, Kraft Heinz and Campbell's have all issued bleak annual forecasts on strained consumer spending, which took a further hit after U.S. President Donald Trump's erratic tariff decisions fanned worries of prices shooting up again.

""With national brands already experiencing a drop in demand, its (Conagra) supply-chain issues are salt in the wound,"" said Emarketer analyst Blake Droesch.

""This puts the company in a vulnerable position heading into the rest of the year, where its challenges are likely to be compounded by the impact of tariffs.""

Conagra said it expects limited impact to fiscal 2025 from previously announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and imports from China. It also kept its annual forecasts unchanged.

Shares of the packaged food company rose 3.6% in early trading.

Conagra's third-quarter net sales fell 6.3% to $2.84 billion. Analysts estimated $2.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, missing expectation of 53 cents.

Walmart, Best Buy, and other major retailers are already feeling the impact of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which are set to take effect April 9. The initial 10% tariff will kick in this Saturday, April 5.

Other retailers, including Dollar General (DG+4.65%), Dollar Tree (DLTR-12.09%), Target (TGT-11.31%), and Best Buy (BBY-17.62%), are also taking a hit. Suffering the most damage thus far is Five Below (FIVE-26.62%), whose shares plummeted over 20%, and Best Buy, which saw a nearly 12% drop. Retailers are bracing for the fallout, with many executives warning that rising costs could push prices higher for consumers.

Retail giants like Walmart, Costco, and Target are reportedly racing to shift the tariff burden onto their Chinese suppliers, a move that could help them absorb some of the financial pressure. However, suppliers operating on razor-thin margins may pass those costs back to U.S. companies, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers on everyday items like fruits, vegetables, electronics, and apparel.

Walmart (WMT-2.91%), Best Buy, and Target have already indicated they may raise prices should tariffs take effect. The National Retail Federation (NRF) recently issued a warning, projecting a slowdown in consumer spending for 2025 if tariffs continue to escalate. Both Gregory Daco, EY’s chief economist, and Sarah Wolfe, Morgan Stanley’s (MS-9.63%) senior economist and strategist, expressed concerns that higher-than-expected tariff could increase everyday costs, putting a strain on household budgets and dampening consumer demand.

New tariffs from the Trump administration, slapping a 10% base rate on imports, are rattling the retail sector, hitting giants like Best Buy and home-furnishing firms hard.

What does this mean?

These tariffs, set to impact imports from China, Japan, and other countries, are creating a tough environment for retailers reliant on imported goods. Best Buy, which focuses on import-driven, big-ticket items, saw its shares dive 15% following the announcement, while Wayfair, RH, Williams-Sonoma, and Arhaus took even bigger hits. RH plans to work with manufacturers to soften the effect on margins after missing fiscal targets. Conversely, Williams-Sonoma stays optimistic, expecting limited macroeconomic effects. Experts suggest consumers might absorb some cost hikes, as vendors are likely to pass some tariff expenses onto retailers.

Why should I care?

The bigger picture: Retail reshuffling on the rise.

While hardline retailers struggle with tariff impacts, those less reliant on imports like Chewy and Petco Health and Wellness, along with auto parts retailers like AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive, appear more resilient. Their focus on essential items and pricing power could help them weather the changing trade landscape, highlighting a broader market shift towards resilience against import volatility.

For markets: The import-export debate.

The tariffs' introduction has injected uncertainty into market dynamics, affecting investor confidence and share values. Some retailers may try cost-cutting and pricing tactics, but the overall impact on consumer spending and economic sentiment is still up in the air. As markets adjust, analysts continue to evaluate how these tariffs will affect purchasing power and sector growth in the coming months.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-x4W9QLyc66CJ8JgoIJ06tf8D.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=6844e19748ee6c1e03880a9935af03b9,N,,2025-04-03 15:10:11.716457

In recent years, many U.S. apparel makers have gradually reduced their reliance on China because of rising costs there, the abundance of capacity in Southeast Asia, and the threat of a trade conflict with the U.S. always looming.

But Dickson and Gass' sanguine reactions of course came before the Trump Administration's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to impose punitive tariffs on 60 countries, including across-the-board levies of 46% on imports from Vietnam and 26% from India. Suddenly, Gap Inc and Levi's don't seem inoculated at all from Trump's tariff war with the rest of the world.

Gap Inc shares were down 22% in early trading on Thursday, while Levi's were down 11%. Other apparel-heavy retailers saw big drops like Macy's, down 16%. (Home goods retailers, also very exposed to tariffs on Asian suppliers, similarly got dinged, with Restoration Hardware down 42%.)

When President Trump this winter announced his first salvos in the tariff wars, focused initially on China, Canada and Mexico, many retailers rushed to reassure investors that over time, they had lessened their exposure to China, long known as a maker of cheap items for Western brands. Target's Chief Commercial Officer said in March that Chinese goods now represent 30% of its merchandise, down from 60% in 2017. Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.

Ditto for Nike, which said in its most recent annual report that factories in Vietnam made half of the shoes it sells and more than a quarter of the apparel in Vietnam. The sportswear giant, trying to carry off a turnaround amid waning interest in its wares, saw its shares fall 15%.

What has investors worried is that it is very difficult to shift production elsewhere with any speed, and there are few new options left anyway.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/21781874/GettyImages-2199420347.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 18:06:31.128528

The lifeline is not a Band-Aid nor yet a permanent solution, with Amsa stating: “The facility is repayable subject to agreement between the parties and contingent on the financial performance, solvency and liquidity of the Long Steel Business,” in a press release.

This development follows a R1.683-billion facility provided by the Industrial Development Corporation, aimed at sustaining the business while seeking long-term solutions to a proposed business dissolution that would have seen South Africa’s longest-running steel producer close down, with thousands of jobs on the line.

Long steel long in the tooth

The long steel business — Amsa’s division focused on the production of fencing material, rail, rods, and bars — serves as a vital supplier to the construction, mining, and manufacturing sectors, with core operations centred in Newcastle and Vereeniging.

While its products form the literal backbone of infrastructure development, the business has struggled to remain standing, in large part due to the broader infrastructure challenges within the country regarding entities such as the Passenger Rail Association of South Africa (Prasa) and Transnet.

By end 2024 operational losses at the Longs division had doubled to R1.1-billion, and for Amsa overall, headline losses topped R5.1-billion — reflecting an unsustainable combination of sluggish domestic demand, punishing electricity tariffs, inefficient rail logistics, and pressure from smaller, nimbler mini-mill competitors.

The wind-down

In November 2023 Amsa announced its intention to shutter long steel operations by April 2025, citing persistent losses and an absence of favourable policy concessions; the company had signalled that it could no longer absorb the unit’s cash burn.

But in a turn of events on Monday, 31 March 2025, Amsa confirmed that the Industrial Development Corporation had stepped in with a R1.683-billion funding facility, halting the shutdown — at least for now.

The Industrial Development Corporation facility is repayable based on the solvency, liquidity, and financial performance of the Long Steel Business, and buys Amsa six more months to stabilise operations and negotiate longer-term reforms.

Government and stakeholder involvement

The deferral forms part of a broader emergency rescue framework involving government ministries, regulators, and key stakeholders. Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau has committed to addressing long-standing structural challenges in the steel sector.

These include a reform of the scrap metal Preferential Pricing System, revisions to the scrap export tax, and the introduction of safeguard tariffs to shield domestic producers from low-cost imports.

To ease pressure on Amsa’s balance sheet, the company has also secured Temporary Employee Relief Scheme funding to offset payroll costs during the deferral window. In response, Amsa has suspended the Section 189(3) retrenchment consultations, offering a temporary reprieve to thousands of workers.

In a joint effort with the Industrial Development Corporation, government representatives have said the deferral period would be used to address “structural problems previously identified by the company”, with the goal of placing the Long Steel Business on a more sustainable footing.

Industrial Development Corporation in to save the day

The Industrial Development Corporation’s support may extend beyond this immediate bailout. The state-owned financier, which already holds a 6.4% stake in Amsa, has signalled its interest in increasing its shareholding. CEO Kobus Verster confirmed that a due diligence process was now under way in a media briefing earlier today: “The Industrial Development Corporation has indicated that they have a desire to look at an increased shareholding, and for that, a due diligence period has been agreed upon.”

Jobs on the line

The decision to keep Amsa’s long steel operations running preserves about 3,500 direct and indirect jobs that would have been lost in the event of a shutdown. But even with this intervention, the sustainability of those jobs hinges on deeper reforms.

South Africa’s steel value chain — critical to sectors such as construction, mining, and automotive manufacturing — relies heavily on long product availability. Any disruption risks ripple effects across the broader economy. The deferral provides breathing room to maintain that supply while systemic fixes are pursued, but should these not be resolved, it’s unclear how similar challenges will be avoided for the Industrial Development Corporation in the future.

The industry’s long-term mettle

Despite the temporary fix, fundamental issues — aging infrastructure, low cost competitiveness, and regulatory burden — require more than financial stopgaps. Without major industrial reform, the Long Steel Business could merely be delaying the inevitable.

Protective tariffs have been inconsistently applied, and regulatory interventions have often come too late to be effective. The scrap Preferential Pricing System, in particular, has been blamed for distorting market prices and advantaging recyclers over primary producers like Amsa.

During the deferral period, Amsa will explore strategic alternatives to turn the business around. These include operational efficiency programmes, modernising production processes, expanding the product range, and deepening supplier and customer collaboration.

More promisingly, Amsa is cautiously optimistic about green shoots in demand — particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, where state and private projects could revive appetite for long steel products.",https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BM-Ray-ArcelorMittal-MAIN.jpg?fit=1280%2C678&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-03 12:18:16.835017

Decathlon operates in 79 territories and continues its international development. In India, the company is investing €100 million ($111 million) over the next five years to expand its store count and manufacturing capabilities. In Germany, Decathlon plans to invest up to €100 million by 2027 in opening new stores and modernizing existing locations.

Decathlon said its partnership with the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics was a highlight of the year. Decathlon designed and manufactured the outfits for the 45,000 volunteers. This collaboration resonated with the public, with 1.8 million licensed products sold in 2024. In addition, Decathlon recorded a 10 percent increase in store traffic (omni-channel) across France during the Olympic Games and a 6.7 percent rise during the Paralympic Games.

In other Decathlon news, the company reported embarking on a new phase in its history, appointing Javier López as chief executive officer, replacing CEO Barbara Martin Coppola, who has had the role since March 2022.

“I am particularly honored by the confidence of Julien and the Board of Directors as I take up my new position, and I thank Barbara, with whom I have enjoyed working in the Executive Committee for the past three years,” offered López. “As a Decathlonian for 26 years, I’m proud of the work we’ve done over the years to bring the benefits of sport to more and more people around the world. Together, with all our teammates, we will, with determination, enthusiasm and humility, accelerate our economic development and our efforts to serve our human and environmental commitments.

Julien Leclercq, who has assumed the role of chairman of Decathlon’s Board of Directors, commented, “I would like to thank Barbara for the impactful work she has carried out over the past 3 years. Today, Decathlon is a sports brand that is increasingly recognized around the world for its products, its commitments and its positive impact. As Decathlon embarks on a new phase in its history, I have every confidence in Javier and his natural ability to bring people together to drive our ambition and identify new levers for sustainable growth while further strengthening our unique human and inclusive culture.”

ID3,Albertsons,2025-04-03 13:33:28+00:00,Cincinnati Business Courier,Kroger spent over $1B on failed Albertsons acquisition - Cincinnati Business Courier,Steve Watkins,,,,,https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2025/04/03/grocer-kroger-spent-billion-failed-albertsons-deal.html,"Kroger Co. spent more than a billion dollars on the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.
Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger.
He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.
Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value.
“Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint.","Kroger Co. spent more than a billion dollars on the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, detailed those expenses in its newly released Form 10-K filed April 1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kroger officials said the company spent $1.044 billion in merger-related expenses dating back to 2022. The majority of those, $684 million, were incurred in fiscal 2024, which ended Feb. 1, 2025. Those costs followed $316 million in fiscal 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger. The deal would have combined the nation’s second-largest operator of traditional supermarkets in Albertsons with Kroger. It would have been the largest merger involving U.S. supermarkets in history and combined Kroger’s 2,722 stores with Albertsons’ 2,271 stores to create a national behemoth.

But regulators and state attorneys general opposed the acquisition and merger on antitrust grounds. They believed the combination would be anticompetitive in many markets. The Federal Trade Commission sued in February 2024 to block it and multiple state attorneys general sued to halt the acquisition. All cited antitrust factors.

A federal court judge sided with the FTC in ruling Dec. 10, 2024, to halt the deal and a Washington state court judge issued a similar ruling the same day. Albertsons and Kroger separately called off the transaction the next day.

Albertsons also sued Kroger Dec. 11 for breach of the merger agreement.

Through it all, Kroger spent that $1 billion-plus largely on third-party professional fees and credit facility fees, Kroger officials said in the filing. Those likely consist largely of attorney fees and costs related to Kroger’s issuance of $10.5 billion in debt in August to pay for the acquisition. Kroger later used much of that money to buy back $7.5 billion in stock.

Kroger officials didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Analysts largely said merger-related charges like that, even when they’re for a deal that ultimately didn’t happen, are the price companies pay for doing business.

“These expenses are generally viewed as the cost of doing business and investors tend to look through these one-time costs,” Johnson Investment Counsel Senior Research Analyst Joe Abbott told me.

He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.

“In other words, the acquisition-related expenses would have been more than paid for by the long-term value created by the combined entity,” Abbott said.

Kevin Gade, chief operating officer and portfolio manager at downtown-based Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said Kroger has been able to overcome those costs that ultimately didn’t pay off.

“I would categorize it as a stranded cost that is likely to get no return on that time or money spent unless Kroger pursues Albertsons again imminently,” Gade said. “Kroger has been an excellent investment since the deal was officially called off in December. So while absorbing stranded costs is painful, the market was skeptical on this deal.”

Indeed, Kroger shares have gained 16% since the market closed Dec. 9, the day before the court rulings against the deal were issued. Kroger stock gained 4 cents Wednesday to close April 2 at $67.27.

But James Lewis, portfolio manager and senior equity research analyst at Bartlett Wealth Management, said the costs are higher than those incurred in most deals. Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value. Kroger’s costs are at the high end of that range, he said.

“One factor to consider is the complexity of the deal,” Lewis said. “Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint. Regulatory hurdles were high. Deals involving companies in unrelated industries typically have lower acquisition costs since the transaction does not undergo strict regulatory oversight.”

Kroger is certain to incur even more costs. Albertsons is suing it to collect a $600 million termination fee. C&S Wholesale Grocers, which agreed to buy 579 stores that Kroger planned to divest in order to appease regulators, also is suing Kroger to collect a $125 million termination fee.

Whether Kroger ends up paying those fees, settling for lower amounts or wins, it’ll incur further attorney and legal fees in the process.

The Albertsons acquisition's termination also was closely followed by fallout in Kroger’s C-suite. CEO and Chairman Rodney McMullen resigned March 2 following a Kroger board investigation of his personal conduct that, while ""unrelated to the business, was inconsistent with Kroger’s Policy on Business Ethics,” the company said in a news release. No other details have been released. Lead director Ron Sargent was named interim CEO and chairman.

Elsewhere in the 10-K filing, Kroger lists 14 risk factors that could affect its business. All companies list risks to the business. While the list is quite comprehensive and largely reflects similar risks to a year ago, one factor on last year’s list is missing this year: “Our proposed transaction with Albertsons creates incremental business, regulatory and reputational risks.”

Another change among risk factors this year is the presence of tariffs as a concern. Kroger lists tariffs as risks under the fuel, economic conditions and supply chains categories. As it relates to Kroger’s fuel sales, the company noted it can’t predict the cost and availability of fuel and how customers will react, possibly due to tariffs among other factors.

Tariffs also are viewed as creating uncertainty regarding future economic conditions. And tariffs could hurt Kroger’s business by interrupting its product supply, the company said. The word “tariff” didn’t appear among risk factors a year ago.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12935048/kroger-building-4*1200xx3600-2025-0-188.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 14:07:06.539758

OUTLOOK

Based on our current plans and the uncertain macroeconomic environment we are providing the following financial outlook for the full year and first quarter.

Fiscal Year 2025

Revenue Growth of 10% to 13%

Adjusted Operating Margin of 14% to 15%

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 20% to 21%

First Quarter 2025

Revenue Growth of 12.5% to 13.5% Adjusted Operating Margin of 6.5% to 7.0%

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 12.5% to 13.0%

The above outlook includes a negative 160 to 200 basis point Operating Margin impact from investments and startup costs to support our international expansion.

Our Product Transformation Plans for 2025 include:

The introduction of our new RH Outdoor Sourcebook, featuring the most dominant assortment of high-quality outdoor furniture in the world arrived in homes early February with eight new furniture collections, an exciting new textiles offering, plus a significantly improved in-stock position to start the season versus a year ago.

The introduction of our new RH Interiors Sourcebook arrived in homes mid-February though early March, featuring 42 new collections across furniture, upholstery, lighting, rugs and textiles, as well as an additional 15 new collections launched on RH.com. While we had planned a higher amount of new collections for this book, due to the rapidly changing economic outlook, we believed it was prudent to delay some of our introductions until later in the year.

The launch of a significant new brand extension in the Fall of 2025 that we believe will meaningfully expand the market size and share of the RH brand. This new brand extension will include a new Sourcebook, a significant website presence and two freestanding Galleries dedicated to the New Concept. Our plan includes integrating RH Couture Upholstery by Dmitriy & Co. and RH Bespoke Furniture by Joseph Jeup into this new brand extension, enabling greater exposure and market reach versus standalone concepts. We will be sharing more details of this exciting new venture during our first quarter earnings call.

As communicated last quarter, we do not expect a negative impact to results related to previously announced increased tariffs on products from China, Canada or Mexico. As it relates to reciprocal and other tariffs that will be announced today, as we’ve done with prior tariffs, we will be working with our manufacturing partners to mitigate the impact to both our margins and costs to our customers.

We believe it is also important to note that we have been manufacturing upholstered furniture in our own North Carolina factory for over ten years, and have recently expanded the facility, doubling our capacity. We are currently projecting that 48% of our upholstered furniture will be produced in the U.S., 21% of our upholstered furniture will be produced in Italy, and 14% of our total business will be produced in the U.S. by the end of this year.

Now let me shift your attention to the expansion of our platform.

PLATFORM EXPANSION

We continue to open the most inspiring and immersive physical experiences in our industry, and some would say the world. Spaces that are a reflection of human design, a study of balance, symmetry and perfect proportions. Spaces that blur the lines between residential and retail, indoors and outdoors, home and hospitality. Spaces with garden courtyards, rooftop restaurants, wine and barista bars. Spaces that activate all of the senses, and spaces that cannot be replicated online.

Our plan to expand the RH brand globally, address new markets locally, and transform our North American Galleries represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

Our Platform Expansion Plans for 2025 include:

The opening of 7 Design Galleries, 2 Outdoor Galleries, plus 2 New Concept Galleries.

The seven new Design Galleries are: RH Oklahoma City, The Gallery at the Oak and RH Montreal, The Gallery at Royalmount, both opening in the first half of this year. RH Paris, The Gallery on the Champs-Élysées, RH Detroit, The Gallery in Birmingham, RH Manhasset, The Gallery at the Americana, RH San Diego, The Gallery at University Town Center, and RH Palm Desert, The Gallery on El Paseo, are all opening in the second half of this year.

Additionally, we plan to expand our brand presence in Greenwich, Connecticut, by developing a multi-building RH Design Ecosystem inclusive of the existing RH Gallery at the Historic Post Office, a freestanding RH Outdoor Gallery that opened last month, plus a New Concept Gallery in the former Ralph Lauren building on Greenwich Avenue opening in the second half of this year.

We also plan to expand our brand presence in East Hampton this Summer by opening a freestanding RH Outdoor Gallery and are exploring plans to further enhance our Design Ecosystem with a New Concept Gallery in the near future.

As previously communicated, we anticipate an inflection of our business in Europe as we begin to open in the important brand building markets of Paris in 2025, plus London and Milan in 2026, all with dramatic and brand building hospitality experiences. We believe post each opening we will begin to have the scale to support the necessary advertising investments to accelerate our growth in Europe.",http://hfbusiness.com/portals/0/logo_HFB_fb1.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 22:59:25.646722

The country is the largest textile exporter in the world, supplying apparel and footwear companies with tons of inventory.
Companies like Nike increasingly rely on Vietnam and Indonesia, which now face 46% and 32% tariffs.
It’s not just apparel makers that will be affected.
Following Trump’s announcement, which happened minutes after markets closed, share prices for Nike, Lululemon, Gap and other apparel makers tumbled.","President Donald Trump announced baseline tariffs of 10% on all imported goods on Wednesday, as well as higher ones against products imported from Asian countries that will negatively affect apparel makers like Oregon-based Nike and department stores like Seattle-headquartered Nordstrom.

China, which already had a 20% tariff levied on its exports, faces an additional 34% after Trump’s announcement. The country is the largest textile exporter in the world, supplying apparel and footwear companies with tons of inventory.

But other countries have become huge sources. Companies like Nike increasingly rely on Vietnam and Indonesia, which now face 46% and 32% tariffs.

While announcing the “reciprocal” tariff plan, Trump repeated messages from the campaign trail that sweeping tariffs would eventually bring manufacturing and other jobs back to the U.S. Shifting production strategies may not be likely or even wise for retail companies, however, leaving them in an awkward and perhaps painful spot.

“There’s nothing they can do in the short term,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar. “And realistically they won’t do anything because nobody knows how long these tariffs will last.”

Companies like Nike and Lululemon have contracts with suppliers in Vietnam and China. Contracts they can’t get out of or get around easily.

It’s not just apparel makers that will be affected. Department stores like Nordstrom are vulnerable to rising costs as well, Swartz said.

Retailers, which have struggled recently, may not weather a trade war as easily as Nike with its cash reserves or Lululemon, which might not see a decrease in demand with higher prices. Even in a strong economy, traditional retailers haven’t generated strong revenue growth.

“Most of what Nordstrom and other retailers sell is imported and that’s not going to change,” Swartz said. “Their biggest hope is that tariffs won’t last long. If they last for two months, the companies will survive. If tariffs last for a couple of years, they’ll get worried.”

Swartz said Nordstrom doesn’t have the pricing power of other retailers, meaning it could also be squeezed by rising costs and lose demand. Nordstrom’s discount Rack stores are popular, but if it has to pass off import costs to customers it could drive business to stores like Marshall’s that buy inventory already in the U.S.

But despite that, Swartz said Nordstrom will be able to get through trade turmoil. It’s about to be taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group through a $6.25 billion deal, which will keep it away from the scrutiny of Wall Street.

Following Trump’s announcement, which happened minutes after markets closed, share prices for Nike, Lululemon, Gap and other apparel makers tumbled. Nike’s stock priced dropped 7% and Gap’s fell by more than 8%. Lululemon’s slipped more than 11%.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04022025_tzr_tzr_155240.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-04-02 22:59:19.620046

Yeah, Josh, looking uh, ugly here in the after hours. Walmart stock down over four, uh, 4%. Amazon stock getting slammed, close to 5%. You just lock in on, uh, Walmart, for example. This is a company that gets about 70% of its cost of goods sold, AKA merchandise, from China. Sure, they have a big grocery business, but a lot of the, uh, apparel, sneakers, belts, you name it, they get that stuff from China. And of course, Amazon, uh, relying its marketplace sellers rely on China and the European Union. You heard the reporting there from Jen, European Union going to get slapped with a 20% tariff. China, 34%. That could cause marketplace sellers to raise prices pretty soon. That could also mean a demand pullback, potentially not good holiday shopping seasons for both of those names. But I'm holding up my Air Jordans sneaker here, guys, because before this segment, I'm like, where the hell did this sneaker come from? Guess what? It's made in China. Uh, and that's why you're seeing Nike shares down over 6% on this news. A lot of pressure, uh, on Nike. Now, they have also, uh, diversified. They're not alone, diversifying, uh, into Vietnam. Well, guess what? Vietnam, they get, uh, hit with the tariff of 46%. So all those retail executives that have told me and been very excited about, well, we, we're moving to Vietnam, we're going to try to save costs. Well, no luck. Uh, you were relying on Vietnam, you're going to get taxed a lot more. You're probably going to have to push through price increases.

While credit deterioration is not yet a major concern, there may be macro-driven reserve builds as banks adjust for downside risks, analysts added.

Strong trading revenues could drive upside to their earnings estimates, with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs seen as best positioned to outperform expectations.

JPMorgan

The analysts raised their Q1 earnings per share estimate for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM, ETR:CMC) to $4.71 from $4.58, above the $4.57 consensus, citing strong trading and investment banking revenues.

CEO Jamie Dimon’s commentary on the macroeconomic environment and regulatory landscape will be closely watched.

The bank’s full-year 2025 net interest income (ex-markets) guidance of $90 billion is seen as defensible in the absence of rapid rate cuts.

The analysts believe that the stock’s valuation may not be attractive enough for management to increase buybacks, which are currently assumed at around 100% total payout.

Goldman Sachs

The analysts also raised their Q1 EPS estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS, ETR:GOS) to $12.98 from $12.25, exceeding the $12.52 consensus.

While tougher trading and M&A advisory comparisons against JPMorgan and peers may temper growth, the potential for a headline earnings beat remains, driven by strong markets revenue, Bank of America believes.

Wells Fargo

The analysts downwardly revised their Q1 EPS forecast for Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC, ETR:NWT) to $1.17 from $1.23, versus the $1.24 consensus but noted the stock “remains a top idea for us.”

They attributed this to a conservative fee forecast despite expectations for a trading rebound to approximately $1.4 billion quarter-over-quarter.

Investment banking may benefit from market share gains, but equity gains are expected to drop off significantly after a strong $715 million performance in Q4 2024.

The key issue for Wells Fargo remains the ongoing asset cap imposed by regulators, which continues to limit growth potential. “[Wells Fargo] needs asset-cap removed to clear the decks for both management and the Street to reframe the risk/reward,” analysts wrote.

Citigroup

The analysts raised their Q1 EPS estimate for Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) to $1.86 from $1.83, slightly below the $1.89 consensus.

“While results may not be a catalyst, these could serve as a clearing event into the June stress test results where we expect Citi to see some capital relief,” they wrote.

The pace of buybacks remains a key focus, with analysts assuming $1.5 billion in repurchases for Q2 2025, ramping up to $3 billion per quarter in the second half of the year.

Citigroup’s ability to defend its pre-provision net revenue against a weaker revenue environment will also be closely watched.

Morgan Stanley

For Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), the analysts reduced their Q1 EPS estimate to $2.23 from $2.24, below the $2.29 consensus, which includes approximately $150 million of drag related to severance charges.

“Equities trading strength and lagged impact on wealth from market weakness (more a Q2 event) should combine for a strong Q1 2025,” they believe.

Investors will closely monitor net new asset growth, which has averaged several billion dollars per quarter over the past year, as a key indicator of future acceleration, the analysts added.

This article Levi's Q1 To See EPS Growth, Revenue Dip, And Tariff Edge, Says Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com © 2025 Benzinga.com.","Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey reiterated an Outperform rating on Wednesday on the shares of Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) with an unchanged price forecast of $23.00.

LEVI is set to release its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on April 7 after market close. The analyst expects EPS of $0.28, up from $0.26 last year, aligning with consensus estimates.

Revenue is projected to decline 1.3% year-over-year to $1.537 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $1.542 billion. Growth of 1% is anticipated in the Americas and Other Brands segments, while Europe and Asia are expected to see declines of 2% and 7%, respectively.

Gross margin is estimated to improve by 180 basis points to 60.0%, slightly exceeding the 59.9% consensus. Operating margin is expected to reach 10.4%, up from 9.0% last year, and in line with consensus projections.

For fiscal 2025, the company expects reported revenue to decline by 1%-2% from $6.355 billion in FY24, while organic revenue is projected to grow 3.5%-4.5%.

Levi expects FY25 EPS between $1.20-$1.25, aligning with or slightly below last year’s $1.25, while consensus estimates predict EPS of $1.25 with a 1% revenue decline.

LEVI sees tariffs as a potential competitive advantage. The company sources from over 25 countries, with less than 1% of imports coming from China, down from historical levels of 15%-16% and about 5% from Mexico, said the analyst.

Since most production in China and India is for local markets, the recently imposed 25% tariffs in 2025 are expected to have minimal impact.

LEVI rebounded in fourth-quarter FY24 with strong revenue growth after missing expectations in the second and third-quarter. All regions and channels saw notable sequential improvements, with record gross margins achieved without increased promotions.

Looking ahead, the company’s FY25 guidance remains conservative, with lower-than-expected revenue and EPS forecasts, partly due to FX headwinds. Meanwhile, EBIT margin projections offer upside potential.

Levi’s remains well-positioned long-term, benefiting from a stabilizing U.S. denim market, growing direct-to-consumer sales, and product innovation, noted the analyst.

The company has streamlined operations in FY25 by exiting non-core businesses, including Denizen and European footwear, while preparing to sell Dockers. This shift aims to enhance profitability and reduce revenue volatility.

Price Action: LEVI shares traded higher by 1.89% at $16.69 at last check Wednesday.

Buckling under debt, Hooters filed for bankruptcy yesterday so buyers—including its founders—can pivot the brand’s current bro-cave fantasyland image into something more profitable.

Private equity is out: The firms that bought Hooters in 2019 will sell all the US restaurants they own to two franchisees that collectively account for nearly one-third of US Hooters locations, including about half of the chain’s highest-volume spots. The CEO of the Hooters Inc. franchise group, Neil Kiefer, who is also a co-founder of the restaurant chain, blamed the company’s stumbles on “private equity firms and other groups with no history or experience with the Hooters brand.”

PE owners Nord Bay Capital and TriArtisan Capital Advisors added $50 million onto Hooters’s existing $300 million debt load, per Bloomberg.

A 2021 decision to swap waitresses’ classic jogging shorts for underwear-like garments and introduce server bikini nights drew widespread criticism. Most franchisees refused the new uniforms.

Albertsons is set to unveil its full-year earnings forecast, expected to align with Wall Street's expectations, as analyzed by Oppenheimer.

What does this mean?

Projections indicate Albertsons will stick to Oppenheimer's forecast of $2.30 per share for fiscal 2025, closely matching the $2.31 consensus from FactSet. The grocer's strategic plan to save $1.5 billion over three years highlights its focus on customer value and reinvesting in growth, with all first-year savings slated for reinvestment. Challenges such as lower adjusted gross margins from increased pharmacy sales and delivery costs persist, yet Albertsons is determined to hit its fiscal targets. With its traditionally cautious approach to guidance expected to continue, investors are showing increased optimism thanks to strong grocery trends and reduced tariff threats.

Why should I care?

For markets: Banking on the basics.

Investor interest in dedicated grocery retailers like Albertsons is growing, driven by stable grocery sector trends and easing tariff tensions. As Albertsons prepares to report its fourth-quarter results on April 15, there's anticipation of at least $0.41 earnings per share, fueled by 2% identical sales growth led by pharmacy benefits and food inflation. With its stock at $22.53, a 0.63% rise, Albertsons is steering towards stabilizing its market stance.

“Construction spending rebounded in February, following widespread severe weather that may have slowed projects in January,” said Simonson.
""I expect substantial additional spending on highway and rail projects, and possibly broadband internet buildout in poorly connected areas,” Simonson said.
For example, public nonresidential construction spending jumped 6.1% compared to last February.
Meanwhile, private nonresidential spending hasn’t been able to match broader economic metrics.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Nonresidential construction spending increased 0.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.26 trillion, the highest level on record, according to an Associated Builders and Contractors analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data released Tuesday.

Spending rose in nine of the 16 nonresidential subcategories, led by a surge in highway and street construction, which accounted for over 40% of the overall monthly gain, said Anirban Basu, ABC chief economist. Private nonresidential spending increased 0.4% during the month, while public spending jumped 0.2%.

Despite the record-setting total, growth remains uneven across project types, as contractors face high interest rates and trade policy uncertainty, said Basu.

Dive Insight:

Although spending may be at an all-time high, recent hiring practices by contractors suggest they expect fewer opportunities in the near term, said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America. Hiring and job openings both dropped in February, potentially a foreshadowing of a construction slowdown, he said.

“Construction spending rebounded in February, following widespread severe weather that may have slowed projects in January,” said Simonson. “Investment remains positive compared to a year ago but the growth rate for all major categories has cooled, while contractors have trimmed hiring and slashed job openings.”

Simonson also said the record spending number doesn’t necessarily indicate a high water mark.

""I expect substantial additional spending on highway and rail projects, and possibly broadband internet buildout in poorly connected areas,” Simonson said. “There has been rapid growth in water, wastewater, and airport construction, so it is hard to tell if this has peaked yet.”

But despite the new monthly high, the pace of growth tells a different story, said Basu.

For example, public nonresidential construction spending jumped 6.1% compared to last February.

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $1.54 billion, exhibiting a decline of 1% compared to the year-ago quarter.

Over the last 30 days, there has been no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.

Ahead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.

While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.

In light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Levi Strauss metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.

According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenues- Americas' should come in at $735.66 million. The estimate suggests a change of -0.1% year over year.

(Nasdaq: OBIO) has announced its financial results for 2024, alongside major updates on its clinical programs and corporate strategy. The company has demonstrated progress in its global pivotal study for atrioventricular interval modulation (AVIM) therapy and its Virtue Sirolimus AngioInfusion Balloon (SAB) program, while addressing strategic partnerships and enhancing leadership to strengthen operations.

Progress in Clinical Programs

At the forefront of Orchestra BioMed’s efforts is the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, conducted in collaboration with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of AVIM therapy as a treatment for uncontrolled hypertension in pacemaker patients. By modulating intervals to lower blood pressure and enhance diastolic function, AVIM therapy has the potential to redefine the standard of care for such patients. “We believe this therapy can lead to landmark results and lay the foundation for its use in managing blood pressure and cardiovascular health in high-risk populations,” said David Hochman, Chairman, CEO, and Founder of Orchestra BioMed.

Additionally, the company is advancing its Virtue SAB program. A revised study design for the U.S. coronary pivotal study on in-stent restenosis (ISR) has been submitted to the FDA. This study will compare the Virtue SAB, which delivers extended focal-release sirolimus without a balloon coating, to Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon for ISR treatment. FDA approval of the amended investigational device exemption (IDE) is expected in the second quarter of 2025, with study initiation targeted for the second half of the year.

Addressing Strategic Partnerships

Orchestra BioMed is currently restructuring its partnership with Terumo. To expedite this process, both parties have agreed to enter formal mediation, with a resolution anticipated by the second quarter of 2025. The outcome of these discussions is expected to align with the anticipated launch of the Virtue ISR-US pivotal study later this year.

Leadership Enhancements

The company has reinforced its leadership with new appointments to its board of directors. Christopher Cleary, former Senior Vice President at Medtronic, John Mack, former President of Cardiac Surgery at Medtronic, and David Pacitti, CEO of Avanos Medical, bring deep expertise in the medical device and cardiovascular sectors. Additionally, Mark Pomeranz has joined as Executive Vice President & General Manager, Interventional Therapies. Pomeranz has over two decades of experience in medical device innovation, further bolstering Orchestra BioMed’s senior management team.

Key Financial Highlights

Revenue for 2024 was $2.6 million, a slight decline from $2.8 million in 2023, attributed to reduced recognition of partnership revenues.

R&D Expenses increased to $42.8 million from $33.8 million in 2023, reflecting higher costs tied to the BACKBEAT pivotal study.

Net Loss for the year was $61.0 million, or $1.66 per share, compared to $49.1 million, or $1.48 per share, in 2023. The net loss included $10.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $66.8 million as of December 31, 2024, supported by $15.0 million raised through stock sales and $15.0 million drawn from a credit facility.

Looking Ahead

Orchestra BioMed remains committed to advancing its core programs. Upcoming milestones include securing FDA approval for the IDE for the Virtue SAB pivotal study in the second quarter of 2025 and completing site activations for the BACKBEAT study. The company continues to focus on clinical innovation, operational efficiency, and strategic partnerships to address significant unmet needs in cardiovascular care.

By combining breakthrough technologies with skilled leadership, Orchestra BioMed is well-positioned to drive meaningful advances in cardiovascular therapy. Its commitment to transforming care for patients with hypertension and ISR underscores its role as a leader in medical innovation.",https://i0.wp.com/www.mychesco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Orchestra-BioMed.jpg?fit=736%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-02 10:06:10.327095

To deliver exceptional banking experiences daily, OmniBSIC Bank prioritises investment in technology and employee development.","OmniBSIC Bank Ghana Limited has successfully hosted its inaugural Meet the Market event, dubbed ‘Figures in Focus’, bringing together captains of industry, key stakeholders, and regulatory authorities, including representatives from the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pension funds, institutional investors, and customers.

The high-impact session provided deep insights into the bank’s financial standing and strategic direction, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable growth and stakeholder engagement.

Participants had the opportunity to interact directly with the bank’s board members and executives, gaining a clearer understanding of OmniBSIC Bank’s performance and long-term vision.

Speaking at the event, Managing Director Daniel Asiedu emphasised that the bank’s impressive growth trajectory is the result of deliberate strategy, disciplined execution, and a commitment to sound banking principles.

“This level of performance is not coincidental. It is the outcome of meticulous planning, strategic decision-making, and a relentless focus on delivering value to our customers and shareholders,” he stated.

He highlighted key milestones, including the successful recapitalisation in 2021, the bank’s first profit in 2023, and its impressive financial performance in 2024 with a profit of GHC314 million, doubling the bank’s profit for 2023. The bank’s 2024 results also indicated robust growth in total assets to GHC9.4 billion, driven by a 70% increase in customer deposits to GHC8.2 billion, to end the year very liquid and well capitalised. During the same period, the bank expanded its loan portfolio to GHC1.03 billion from GHC580 million in 2023, a growth of 77%, to support business and economic growth.

Asiedu underscored the bank’s cautious lending approach, balancing sustainable expansion with strong client relationships.

OmniBSIC, Ghana’s fastest-growing bank, remains dedicated to enhancing shareholder value, investing in staff development, and fostering diversity within its workforce. “Our responsibility to shareholders is clear—we are building a bank that is financially strong, operationally efficient, and strategically positioned for long-term growth,” Asiedu affirmed.

Board Chair, Teresa Effie Cooke echoed these sentiments, emphasising the bank’s commitment to exceeding customer and stakeholder expectations. A notable achievement in diversity is the bank’s near 50/50 gender balance, underscoring its dedication to equal opportunity and inclusive leadership. “Diversity strengthens our institution, and we remain committed to fostering an equitable workplace where all employees can thrive,” Cooke stated.

Looking ahead, OmniBSIC Bank is focused on solidifying its position as a key player in Ghana’s financial sector. Its growth strategy includes strengthening its capital base, expanding market share, enhancing product and service offerings, as well as investing in cutting-edge digital solutions, amongst others. “Our trajectory is clear, and our focus remains on sustainable growth, innovation, and delivering superior banking experiences,” Asiedu noted.

By continuously improving operational efficiency and embracing financial technology, OmniBSIC Bank is positioning itself to compete at a higher level, ensuring that customers and stakeholders receive exceptional value in the evolving banking landscape in Ghana.

Now, things could get even worse. The United States government is planning to impose new tariffs on products imported from Vietnam. Since Nike produces a huge portion of its shoes and clothes in Vietnam, these new tariffs could mean higher costs for the company.

Nike makes half of its shoes and more than a quarter of its clothes in Vietnam. If the U.S. adds tariffs to these products, Nike will have to decide between raising its prices or absorbing the extra costs. But Nike is already lowering prices on some items to clear out its old inventory. If prices go up too much, fewer people might buy their products, especially since other brands are competing hard for customers.

“If tariffs are extended there, then Nike’s got a problem,” said David Swartz, an analyst.

Nike isn’t the only company that would be affected. Adidas, another major sportswear company, also relies heavily on Vietnam for production. While Adidas doesn’t make as much in Vietnam as Nike does, it still gets 39% of its shoes and 18% of its clothing from the country. Other brands like Lululemon, Columbia Sportswear, and Amer Sports also depend on Vietnam as a key manufacturing hub.

Why Vietnam Matters to Sportswear Brands

Over the years, Vietnam has become one of the most important places for making sportswear. Many brands have moved their production there to avoid high costs in China. Vietnam is known for producing high-tech running shoes, sportswear, and outdoor gear at competitive prices. But now, with the U.S. government considering tariffs, this advantage could disappear.

Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on footwear from Vietnam is 13.6%, while apparel has an 18.8% tariff, according to Sheng Lu, a professor at the University of Delaware. If these rates go even higher, companies will have to pay much more to bring their products into the U.S. This will affect not just big names like Nike and Adidas but also smaller brands that rely heavily on Vietnam for their products.

Ecuador’s Shocking 27% Tariff Triggers Explosive Trade Clash with Mexico

One of these smaller brands is On, a fast-growing running shoe company. In 2024, On sourced 90% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel from Vietnam. Samuel Wenger, the company’s chief operating officer, acknowledged that tariffs play a role in pricing decisions. “Our premium brand gives us the ability to adapt our pricing thoughtfully,” he said.

Sneaker prices in the U.S. have already gone up by 25% since 2019 due to rising production costs, according to Beth Goldstein, a footwear industry analyst. More price increases could be difficult for shoppers to accept, especially as consumer confidence in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest level in four years.

Finding a Solution Won’t Be Easy

For sportswear brands, moving production out of Vietnam is not a simple solution. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, also make sportswear, but they might face tariffs too. Plus, production costs in these countries are already rising as more brands look to shift away from Vietnam and China.

Trump’s Tariff War Stalls Chinese Investment in Mexico

Factories in Cambodia, for example, are charging 5% to 10% more than before as they receive more orders from companies looking to diversify their supply chains, said Michael Yee, CEO of apparel sourcing company MGF Sourcing. This means that even if Nike or Adidas moves production elsewhere, they might still face higher costs.

Despite the concerns, some experts believe that Vietnam might not get hit with tariffs as hard as China. The Vietnamese government has taken steps to strengthen its relationship with the U.S., such as agreeing to import more American goods and lowering duties. Johannes Loefstrand, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, noted that Vietnam has been skillful in managing its geopolitical ties with the U.S.

Meanwhile, Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary in the Trump administration, pointed out that the president had generally good ties with Vietnam and had no reason to impose tariffs that would be strongly felt by everyday consumers. “People notice the cost of apparel because they buy it fairly frequently,” Ross said.",https://regtechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Regtech-Times-2025-04-02T142413.173.png,N,,2025-04-02 08:03:32.695383

The company currently manufactures half of its footwear and nearly a third of its apparel in Vietnam, according to Reuters. If these imports get taxed under the new trade measures launching on April 2, Nike could be forced to either eat the added costs or raise prices—neither of which is great news for a brand already battling falling sales.

Vietnam Dependency Puts Nike and Adidas in the Firing Line

Nike isn’t alone. Adidas (ADDYY), which produces 39% of its footwear and 18% of its apparel in Vietnam, also faces a painful squeeze if the tariffs go through. Moreover, the White House is considering broadening its trade retaliation beyond China, and Vietnam—America’s fifth-largest goods supplier—is next in line. That leaves major apparel and footwear brands scrambling to assess impact.

Smaller Brands Like On and Puma Also Get Hit

It’s not just the giants. Puma (PMMAF) and On (ONON) are both heavily exposed to Vietnam and could be hit just as hard—if not harder. Puma’s shares have already slumped 23% this year following weak profit guidance, and the added pressure from tariffs could deepen the blow. For On, a newer player with fast-growing momentum, added costs could threaten its margins before it ever gets a chance to scale properly.

Vietnam Tries to Lessen the Blow

Vietnam, for its part, is trying to patch things up. The country has cut tariffs on certain U.S. products and approved SpaceX’s Starlink service to smooth over trade relations. But exports to the U.S. make up 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, making it especially vulnerable.

Retailers Warn Prices Could Spike

The retail sector is already sounding alarms. H&M’s CEO warned that U.S. consumers could end up footing the bill. As the April 2 tariff date approaches, brands like Nike and Adidas will need to make tough decisions—fast.

For those tracking the fallout, investors can compare Nike, Adidas, Puma, and On stocks side by side using the TipRanks Stocks Comparison tool. Analysts are most bullish on ONON stock. They’ve given it a Strong Buy rating, and the average price target of $63.53 implies an upside potential of 49% from current price levels.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_1139661275-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 11:10:07.117824

Ferrexpo, an iron ore company with assets in Ukraine, that is listed on the London Stock Exchange, produced 489.72 thousand tonnes of DR-pellets in 2024, while no such products were produced in 2023. This is stated in the company’s report.

Total pellets output in 2024 increased by 58% y/y to 6.07 million tons.

In Q4 2024, Ferrexpo increased pellets production by 18% q/q to 1.503 million tonnes, incl. 163.55 thousand tons of DR-pellets.

“In the challenging circumstances, it is pleasing to report a strong increase in production for 2024 – our best annual production performance since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The higher production reflects our ability to access Ukrainian Black Sea ports again and resume exports to customers in MENA and Asia.” – comments Lucio Genovese, Interim Executive Chair of Ferrexpo.

In total, 37 ocean going vessels were loaded in 2024, comprising 32 vessels from Ukraine and five from other ports, compared to just 19 (from Romania) in 2023.

According to Genovese, one of the key achievements of 2024 was setting a new annual record for DR-pellet production.

“These higher quality pellets generate a higher revenue for the business, which is particularly relevant as we continue to experience high input costs. In the fourth quarter, it is also interesting to note that we increased our production of high grade pellets and concentrate, which contributed to lowering our fixed cost base as production levels increased. This is a further example of flexibility, adjusting our production and sales strategies to match evolving market dynamics.” – added Ferrexpo`s Interim Executive Chair.

Meanwhile, low iron ore prices and high raw material costs continue to put pressure on Ferrexpo. Due to ongoing attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, the company is forced to import electricity from the EU at higher tariffs.

As GMK Center reported, at the end of 2023, Ferrexpo reduced the output of pellets by 36% compared to 2022 – to 3.845 million tons.

Dive Brief:

PVH Corp. fourth quarter revenue was down 5% year over year to $2.4 billion, beating the company’s previous guidance of a 6% to 7% decrease, according to a Monday earnings report. Full year revenue dropped 6% to $8.7 billion, in line with the lower end of the company’s guidance.

At the Tommy Hilfiger brand, both Q4 and full year revenue fell 5% year over year. Calvin Klein’s fourth quarter revenue dropped 2%, while the brand’s full year revenue fell 1%.

The company forecasted flat to slightly increased revenue in 2025, but with revenue projected to be flat or down 2% in the first quarter.

Dive Insight:

PVH has been working to boost the value of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger as part of its strategic PVH+ Plan. The company has also made several recent executive changes, including naming a new CEO of Americas in December and appointing Veronica Leoni as creative director of Calvin Klein in May 2024.

Alice Price, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said in emailed comments that the company’s Q4 improvement suggests the PVH+ Plan “is starting to have legs, as it focuses on developing its key growth categories, increasing consumer engagement and improving efficiencies.” However, she added that the company’s 2025 revenue projections show that “its strategy still has a long way to go before delivering a full turnaround.”

At Tommy Hilfiger, international revenue fell 7% in Q4, with North America revenue remaining flat for the quarter. Full-year revenue figures were the same.

Calvin Klein posted a 4% fourth quarter international decrease and a 3% increase in North America for the same period. The brand’s full fiscal revenue dropped 1%, with its international revenue down 2% and its North America revenue down 1%.

Year-over-year revenue at the company’s Heritage Brands dropped 41% in Q4, including a 28% decrease resulting from the sale of its women's intimates business. For the full year, Heritage Brands revenue was down 57% year over year, including a 45% decrease resulting from the sale.

“In a challenging macro, we delivered another year of strong profitability in North America, drove sequential improvements in our wholesale order books in Europe while improving our quality of sales, and we achieved our third consecutive year of growth in Asia Pacific, on a constant currency basis,” CEO Stefan Larsson said in a statement.

Revenue from the company’s owned and operated stores decreased 4% in the fourth quarter, while revenue from the company’s digital commerce business was down 10%. Total Q4 DTC revenue dropped 5%, including a 4% decline from the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global Greece Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 55.0 in March from 52.6 in February, signaling a significant improvement in operating conditions for Greek manufacturers.

A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 signals contraction.

The March data highlighted a notable uptick in demand, with new orders and export sales rising at the fastest pace in nearly a year, supported by stronger domestic and foreign demand.

That prompted manufacturers to increase their workforce at the sharpest rate since January 2022.

“Growth in the Greek manufacturing sector accelerated at the end of the first quarter, as the pace of expansion reached the strongest for almost a year,” said Sian Jones, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence:

“Improvements in demand conditions supported greater output, new orders, input buying and employment.”

However, inflationary pressures intensified, with input costs rising at the quickest rate since November 2022.

This led to a corresponding increase in selling prices as manufacturers passed on higher costs to customers.

Despite these challenges, manufacturers expressed optimism about future output growth, buoyed by expectations of continued demand strength and increased construction activity.

But have you ever wondered what it takes to serve real, delicious, and affordable food to 26 million Americans each day?

Behind every meal are the people making it possible: from the potato growers in Idaho, cattle ranchers in Texas, and bakers in Illinois, to the small business owners who operate restaurants in communities across the country.

We don’t take our role at the heart of American food lightly – and it’s why we’re continuously working to make it even better for the future. How do we do that? It starts with four promises.

1. We put quality first

The millions of Americans who visit us have high expectations—and rightly so. They want quality, delicious food. But too often, good food with real ingredients means compromising on price or convenience.

That’s not how we do things at McDonald’s. We use real ingredients, many of which are grown, raised, and harvested by local farmers and ranchers. From beef, chicken and fish to potatoes and eggs, it is something we’ll never compromise on. And our long-term relationships mean our suppliers can thrive and grow with us.

What’s not in our food is just as important. Our seven classic burgers—from our Big Mac® to the Quarter Pounder® with Cheese—contain no artificial preservatives or flavors, and no added colors from artificial sources (except the pickle).

The result? Delicious food you can feel good about enjoying:

We use 100% pure beef patties, seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper. We have two partners who have supplied our beef since the day we opened our very first restaurants.

Our Chicken McNuggets® are made with 100% white meat, with no artificial preservatives, colors or flavors. And customers love them: we sell about 700 million pounds of McNuggets every year.

All Filet-O-Fish sandwiches in the U.S. are made with 100% wild-caught Alaska Pollock from U.S. waters, the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands right off the coast of Alaska.

We use freshly cracked eggs on our Egg McMuffin® sandwiches—and all the eggs we source in the U.S. are 100% cage-free.

Our Happy Meal products make balanced meals more accessible by offering recommended food group items like apples and low-fat milks.

In 2023, we bought more than $6.4 billion of quality ingredients in the U.S. That includes 714 million pounds of beef, 133 million pounds of cheese, 2.6 billion pounds of potatoes and nearly 2 billion 100% cage-free eggs.

2. We listen to our customers

We’ve been obsessed with using real, quality ingredients since the day we opened our very first restaurant. And over the years, we’ve evolved our menu to keep pace with the latest customer preferences. Our menu provides clear and transparent nutrition information to help customers like you make informed choices about the menu items you know and love. And we know what’s not in your food is just as important as what’s in your food.

Our seven classic burgers—from our Big Mac® to the Quarter Pounder® with Cheese—contain no artificial preservatives or flavors, and no added colors from artificial sources (except the pickle).

Food additives such as, Red Dye No. 3, TBHQ, BHT/BHA, Titanium Dioxide and Azodicarbonamide are not on the menu.

3. We do right by our supplier partners and help their businesses grow

Over our 70-year history, we’ve carefully selected farmers and suppliers and built strong and long-term relationships based on a simple, shared mission: to serve safe, quality food every day.

It means we can set high standards together and that they can grow with us and create good jobs across the nation.

We have around 30 suppliers that make up 2/3 of our food and packaging.

Our relationships with suppliers create jobs and growth. In 2023 in Houston, we spent $104M with suppliers and supported 15,200 jobs. And in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, it was $85M and 9,800 jobs.

On any given day in 2023, more than 60,000 food safety audits were conducted at McDonald’s restaurants across the country.

“Our suppliers’ actions reverberate throughout the industry. Their commitment to quality, rigorous standards and ability to innovate impacts not just how the food we source is grown—it has the power to change entire industries.”

– Cesar Piña, Chief Supply Chain Officer, McDonald’s USA

4. We innovate together to strengthen America’s future food system.

From finding new ways to farm that protect the local environment and help strengthen small businesses, to growing potatoes that taste better and grow quicker, to working across the food industry to make cage-free eggs the norm: it’s our partnerships that make it all possible. And we’re excited to help make American food even better for the future.

We believe that for food to be delicious, it first has to be real and made with the highest quality ingredients. And when we do that in close partnership with the suppliers who make it possible, we can serve millions of customers every day while supporting thousands of good jobs and strengthening American food for the future.

“Our customers deserve real food with real ingredients – and that’s exactly what's on the menu at McDonald’s. Because when it comes to our food, we like to keep things simple – it’s all about great taste, great quality, and great value.” - Michael Gonda, SVP, Chief Impact Officer of North America for McDonald's",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 20:02:50.663738

Decathlon is addressing this by concentrating on “rigorous cost-control measures” to uphold competitive pricing and foster long-term expansion.","Sportswear company Decathlon has reported their financial performance for 2024 which reflects growth in international markets while the French markets suffer a low blow.

As the global revenue of the sportswear company rose by 5.2 per cent to nearly US $ 17.5 billion, the company attributed the robust performance in the international space to the significant increase in online sales. The global sales grew substantially, rising to 20 per cent of total revenue from 17.4 per cent recorded in the previous year. Supported by large investments in important regions like India and Germany, this expansion is consistent with the company’s plan to increase its e-commerce footprint and establish itself as a worldwide sports brand.

Despite Decathlon partnering with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the company’s revenues did not see a significant surge in France. The home market of France’s revenue remained flat at around US $ 5.13 billion. Sales in physical stores of the home market were significantly affected, although the online sales saw a 5.78 per cent increase, now accounting for 17.5 per cent of the French business.

Decathlon’s net income has declined to around US $ 850 million in 2024, compared to previous 2023’s down from US $ 1,005 million in 2023.

2025 looks to be an incredibly tough year for the supermarket chain, with its stores closing across the country at warp speed.
Piggly Wiggly has to take the award for the grocery chain with the most charming name.","It's a hard time to be a grocery store. Over the last few years, grocery chains have had to battle a perfect storm of post-pandemic changes in customer behavior, rising prices from the cost of living crisis and the potential for tariffs, and advances in technology which have left physical stores more and more obsolete. This meant that 2024 saw the highest number of grocery stores closing since 2020, with folks turning to ordering groceries online to replace it. ""Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganized, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service,"" says Deborah Weinswig, the CEO of Coresight Research, a firm which led analysis into current and future store closures across the U.S., via Business Wire.

Unfortunately, things are only going to get worse from here. Coresight Research also issued a grave prediction that 2025 is set to see even more closures, with as many as 15,000 stores closing its doors this year. Grocery stores are set to take a particular hit, and some of your favorites may be more in trouble than you think. Giants like Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons are set to close several stores in 2025, and others are following suit. Let's take a look at some of the major chains set to shut some of their doors.

On the surface, it seems like Walmart is untouchable. The world's largest company by revenue, it has approximately 4,600 stores across the United States of America, with thousands more across the world. However, even a business as mammoth as Walmart hasn't been immune to the economic shocks that have been ravaging retailers across the country, and as a result the normally affordable supermarket has had to raise its prices, with its eggs taking a particular hit.

This may well have left customers going elsewhere for their weekly grocery shopping, and certain stores in Walmart's line-up have suffered the consequences. The retail giant is closing a number of its stores in California throughout 2025, with others in Georgia and Ohio shutting up shop. It's also going through a reconfiguration on a higher level, with its North Carolina office closing, resulting in some job losses. This is part of a broader move by the retailer to bolster its main hubs in California and Arkansas, but it's still not the best look for the company.

If you're worried about Walmart going out of business any time soon, though, we wouldn't be. Over the next few years, Walmart is aiming to build or convert 150 additional stores, and remodel a large chunk of its existing locations. The retailer states that this will see more jobs being created, which is welcome news. Now if they could just do something about those Walmart groceries that are gonna see a price jump, we'd be fine.

There's a lot of change happening when you shop at Albertsons. The massive grocery chain announced in 2022 that it would be acquired by Kroger, which would have allowed both companies to team up and take on their gargantuan competitors like Walmart and Costco more capably. The deal, however, ended up making its way to the courts, where judges disputed the claim that companies like Walmart were direct competitors for Albertsons and Kroger, and flagged concerns that the joining of the two would lead to market domination in certain areas.

Advertisement

As a consequence, the merger was blocked — and Albertsons has had to shoulder the consequences. In an earnings call in January 2025, Albertsons' leaders stated that they would be looking to close some stores over the coming year as part of a streamlining effort. The company had reached the conclusion that its portfolio of stores was outsized in some areas, while also pointing out that it would be looking to open stores elsewhere. Albertsons didn't specify which stores would be closing (and it also pointed out that the closure process could extend to several years), but we wouldn't be too surprised if your local supermarket was a little worried.

Although Kroger has had a tough couple years, with its acquisition of Albertsons being scuppered before it got to the finish line and some food recalls it probably wants to forget, it's still managed to hold onto almost 2,800 stores across the country. Sadly, though, it's looking as though a few of those will be closing pretty soon — and those doors have already started shutting. In late January, Kroger announced the closure of its Belle Meade Plaza store in Nashville. It was one of several businesses that has been affected by redevelopment plans in the area, with retail and residential units planned to be built in its place.

Kroger will also see its Sterling Ridge location close in The Woodlands, Texas, with a planned final operation date of May 6. Although its other stores in the area will stay active, this particular Kroger location has suffered from a change in shopping habits in the immediate area. The way people buy their groceries has quite simply changed, and low foot traffic has rendered this store obsolete. The employees who currently work at the store will go through a reassignment process to hopefully work at other locations.

There's something cosy and vaguely nostalgic about Winn-Dixie, the Southeastern grocery chain that operates across five different states. Perhaps that partly comes from its local feel, and partly from the fact that it's never been a massive chain that has made it to other parts of the country. Unfortunately, that's also made it a threat for the bigger sharks in the supermarket ocean. In 2023, Winn-Dixie was acquired by Aldi, giving the German retailer the ability to make big moves across the Southeastern market and the potential to shut and convert stores at its will. Aldi also acquired Harvey's, another Southeastern favorite that may soon disappear from view completely.

It looks like it's pressing on with its plans pretty quickly. Reports of Winn-Dixie stores closing or being converted are springing up regularly in 2025. Two stores in Columbus and Phenix City have announced their closures in April and May, while others in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson, and Orlando have begun the conversion process into Aldis. In total, roughly 50 Winn-Dixie and Harvey's stores are due to be converted in the next 12 months or so. To be honest, we'd be surprised if any locations still existed at all by the end of the decade.

Someone needs to check on Safeway — we're not sure if it's alright. 2025 looks to be an incredibly tough year for the supermarket chain, with its stores closing across the country at warp speed. In February, Safeway had to shut its Webster Street store in San Francisco, citing customer safety concerns and persistent occurrences of theft. The city itself has been roundly criticized for not thinking of a plan that can cover this store's closure, which has left its residents without any full-service grocery stores in the immediate area. Given that Safeway took its pharmacy with it, many people have been left without easy access to medication.

Elsewhere, Safeway's fortunes aren't looking much better. The retailer is set to close its Rockville Pike, Maryland store in April, although this information was revealed by the employees of the store itself and not a press release. Another store in the Bay Area is due to shut in mid-April, with safety concerns again cited by Safeway as the reason, although it did also mention financial pressures as a driver for ceasing operations. Curiously, all of this has been done without any clear blow to Safeway's overall finances. In Q3 of 2024, it reported higher identical and digital sales, and for all intents and purposes appears to be a healthy company. Perhaps things are a bit more complicated than they appear, though.

Part of the appeal of Shaw's is that it's always been a big fish in a relatively small pond, which has given it a sense of familiarity. The retailer operates its 125 stores exclusively in the New England region, and while it may not have the footprint of Walmart, it has a local feel that's a bit more cosy. Unfortunately, that may not be lasting much longer. Shaw's recently announced that it was closing two of its stores in New England in 2025, and it could be the case that more are to follow.

The Shaw's store closures in Gloucester, Massachusetts and Concord, New Hampshire were announced in mid-March, with employees being relocated to nearby locations. ""Like all retailers, we're constantly evaluating the performance of our stores,"" the retailer said in a statement seen via Boston.com. ""Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we're focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most."" The good news is that there are dozens of locations in both states that are still operating, but it's never a good sign when a supermarket seems to be shutting up shop.

You would think that with the unstoppable march of Amazon taking over all our lives, and the frankly wild amount of money the company makes, its brick-and-mortar grocery concept Amazon Fresh would be able to get an immediate foothold on the market. Well, interestingly, that hasn't quite been the case. In March 2025, the chain announced the closure of two of its stores California and Virginia, with the Virginia branch to close pretty much immediately and the California one to shut at the end of April.

Advertisement

The branches had only been in operation for a couple years before they had to close, which raised question marks about whether Amazon Fresh's pitch of ""frictionless"" technology, where you can just walk out without having to scan anything, was appealing to customers. People have already started dubbing them zombie stores, after all. However, Amazon was very keen to make the point that it was still committed to Amazon Fresh and figuring out exactly what works for customers. Perhaps it was just these few stores that didn't quite hit the mark, and we'd be surprised if it disappears completely any time soon. However, we could be seeing the beginnings of a rare misstep for Amazon.

Piggly Wiggly has to take the award for the grocery chain with the most charming name. However, even that can't save it from having to close its stores. 2025 will see several of its branches closing, and while its presence in the South is still pretty strong, it's made us question how long this iconic brand can last. It all started going awry in January, when the Piggly Wiggly in Lanett, Alabama announced that it was closing. The closure put an end to the long presence that Piggly Wiggly had in the community.

Advertisement

Things got even worse from there on in, with a beloved Piggly Wiggly in Columbia, South Carolina announcing that it was shutting its doors for the final time in March. Nicknamed ""The Social Pig,"" the store was a favorite of locals and university students alike, and was well-known as being a fixture in Columbia. ""Our lease has expired, and being unable to effectuate another that would continue the store as Piggly Wiggly, it is my sad duty to announce that our iconic Pig on Devine — the 'Social Pig' — is closing,"" said operator Darrell Miller in a post on Facebook. ""I submit our sincere thanks to the residents of the surrounding communities and the Greater Columbia area for your steadfast and generous support over the past fifty years. You have blessed us."" The post was flooded with comments in tribute to the store. These places matter, folks.

Dollar General may be a discount store, but it takes its income and profit margins very seriously. The chain, which sells discount groceries as well as a host of other goods, operates thousands of stores around the country, and it's not afraid to make bold moves when some of them aren't working. This was proven in a Q4 2024 investor call, in which Dollar General announced that it had conducted a ""store portfolio optimization review."" This is intense corporate talk for ""we checked how much money our stores were making, and some of them need to go.""

Advertisement

As a result, Dollar General told investors that it was to close 96 of its stores by the start of 2026. It also noted that it was going to convert six of its pOpshelf stores to Dollar General outlets in the same period, and close pOpshelf stores as well. This is a pretty dramatic move from the chain, and could see plenty of folks without a local Dollar General to buy cut-price goods from — which, at a time like this, isn't great news. The store didn't indicate which stores were going to be closed, but we should expect further announcements very soon.",https://www.thedailymeal.com/img/gallery/9-major-grocery-chains-closing-several-locations-in-2025/l-intro-1743527302.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 16:05:43.070972

This is the third time the health care conglomerate's bankruptcy strategy has failed in court.

Facing lawsuits from 60,000 claimants, the settlement would have ended the cases and prevented new ones in the future. In a news release, Johnson & Johnson called the claims ""meritless"" and based on ""junk science."" The company said it will return to the tort system to litigate the claims.

“Today’s decision highlights the broken tort system in the United States. The Company reiterates that none of the talc-related claims against it have merit and attempts to resolve this litigation were aimed at moving past this issue,” said Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of Litigation with Johnson & Johnson. “The decision to litigate every filed case is based on the simple fact that this is a fake claim created by greedy plaintiff lawyers looking for another deep pocket to sue and fueled by litigation-financed attorney advertising.”

Johnson & Johnson claims its products are safe, do not contain asbestos, and do not cause cancer. The company stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. in 2020, switching to a corn starch product.

The company had previously reached a $700 million settlement with dozens of states that had sued the company. The settlement allowed Johnson & Johnson to deny any wrongdoing.

Albertsons and C&S both allege that Kroger is responsible for the deal’s demise under pressure from regulators.
Albertsons and C&S are also demanding that Kroger pay them termination fees of $600 million and $125 million, respectively.
“We need that from a new leader: to be a little more specific about what the end game is.”","The last time Kroger brought on a new CEO was in January 2014. At that point, the company was riding high in the grocery industry: It was just about to close on its $2.5 billion acquisition of Harris Teeter, the tumult of the COVID-19 pandemic was still years away and Walmart had yet to assume the commanding role it now plays in the U.S. food retail sector.

A lot has changed over the past decade.

As Kroger looks for a successor to Rodney McMullen — who departed abruptly in early March after more than 11 years as the company’s chief executive — the grocer faces much less favorable circumstances that have industry experts wondering whether it can regain its former glory. Some of those conditions, like the enormous reach of competitors like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, are beyond its control, while other challenges are a direct result of decisions Kroger made when McMullen was in charge, according to analysts.

“The golden age of Kroger was before Rodney took over,” said Scott Mushkin, CEO of R5 Capital, referring to Kroger’s approach to the grocery industry under David Dillon, McMullen’s immediate predecessor as Kroger’s CEO. “If you just look at the business … I would say they’re kind of bumping along, kind of hanging on a little bit rather than thriving.”

Kroger’s challenges include recovering from its unsuccessful effort to merge with Albertsons — a transaction McMullen crafted and championed as CEO. The company faces lawsuits from Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire nearly 600 divested stores in connection with the deal. Albertsons and C&S both allege that Kroger is responsible for the deal’s demise under pressure from regulators.

In its suit, filed in December, Albertsons claims that Kroger damaged the companies’ chances of winning approval for the merger because it was unwilling to develop more robust divestiture plans. Kroger responded with its own allegations, claiming that Albertsons worked secretly with C&S on a “misguided campaign” that led to the disintegration of the deal.

Albertsons and C&S are also demanding that Kroger pay them termination fees of $600 million and $125 million, respectively. Kroger has refused to do so, claiming that Albertsons and C&S forfeited the fees.

Under Dillon, Kroger focused heavily on basic operational details, like the length of checkout lines, customer service and store cleanliness, all of which helped the company maintain its position as a leader in the grocery space, Mushkin said. But more recently, Kroger has been less effective at communicating its value proposition to consumers than rivals like Sprouts Farmers Market and Publix, he added.

“It’s very difficult when you’re multi-banner, multi-regional, with different go-to-market strategies, to define what you are,” said Mushkin. “It's the challenge for whoever takes over Kroger: Why, as a consumer, should I shop you beyond location?”

A key issue for Kroger as it plots its future course is that its prices look more expensive to consumers than other retailers, a contrast that is exacerbated by Kroger’s dependence on promotions while Walmart has an everyday low-pricing model, said Karen Short, managing director and head of consumer and retail research for Melius Research.

“They’ve gotten themselves completely out of whack on pricing relative to their competitors,” Short said. “And I don’t know how you dig yourself out of all of that, because Walmart is increasingly giving you a reason to not go to Kroger.”

One way for Kroger to counter the perception that it charges more than Walmart for groceries would be to sacrifice its earnings for a while in order to invest in bringing down prices, Short said. However, that could prove to be a hard sell to investors given that the company’s operating profit and sales have been under pressure.

While Kroger’s stock price grew at a significantly faster clip than Walmart’s between 2013 and 2015, the trend reversed starting in 2016, with Walmart widening its lead during the past year, according to a research note Short and fellow Melius analyst Jacob Aiken-Phillips issued on March 14. On Tuesday, Short and Aiken-Phillips downgraded their rating of Kroger’s stock to “sell,” citing Walmart’s surging strength in grocery, Kroger’s leadership void and the legal actions brought by Albertsons and C&S as reasons investors should unload their shares.

Short also said Kroger’s search for a replacement for McMullen presents it with a unique opportunity to change course, adding that the company — which is currently under the leadership Ronald Sargent, who is serving as chairman and interim CEO — should look outside for a new leader.

“I think Kroger is rudderless, and they need somebody who is going to bring new blood and new life and new thought,” she said.

Speaking during an earnings call on March 6, Sargent said Kroger intends to consider candidates to replace McMullen from within its ranks and outside the company.

A new leader could likely help Kroger move past issues such as the failed combination with Albertsons and instead focus on reframing its relationship with consumers, said David Halliday, associate teaching professor of strategic management and public policy at the George Washington University School of Business.

“The time to do that is when a new CEO comes in. A new CEO can set a long-term plan, [while] an existing CEO is going to have a harder time making tough decisions like trading off profits for a viable long-term pricing strategy,” Halliday said. “The pricing strategy can't just be selling cheap food … but something that viably connects with customers and gives customers more value than they’re getting now.

Short said Kroger’s efforts in recent years to double down on its data operations and invest in the multibillion-dollar network of automated fulfillment centers it has developed with Ocado are also weighing Kroger down at a time when it needs to find ways to stand out.

Short added that Kroger’s efforts to invest in alternative profit businesses, which include its data analysis and third-party media operations, have distracted attention from weaknesses in its core grocery business. In addition, the Ocado project has cost much more than expected, she said.

As Kroger considers whom to hire to lead it going forward and how it should adjust its strategy, the company would do well to stay grounded in its roots as a supermarket operator, said Doug Munson, head of advisory services business development for retail intelligence provider RetailStat.

Although the pressure to compete head-to-head with major competitors is intense across areas like e-commerce, pricing and non-grocery revenue streams, Kroger should focus more on improving the quality and distinctive value of its core grocery business, Munson said.

Kroger is “not going to beat the Wiincos and the Walmarts on pricing, but the narrative should be, ‘When you come here, this is where you get your staples. This is your fundamental grocery store,’” Munson said.

More immediately, analysts will be looking for Kroger to clarify its vision about where it fits in the grocery landscape, said Michael Infranco, assistant vice president of Retailstat.

“We haven’t had the clearest strategies overall, the top-to-bottom strategy of what they want to be,” Infranco said. “We need that from a new leader: to be a little more specific about what the end game is.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Wp3yUqLaE8aqPwcxryVB1oqDI9JOamVLcgYr1V8GPFA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9IYXJyaXNfVGVldGVyLXN0b3JlX2V4dGVyaW9yLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-01 13:10:19.117291

Nike faces potential U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam, where it produces 50% of its footwear and 28% of its apparel. Higher tariffs could raise costs or force price hikes amid declining sales. Other brands like Adidas and Lululemon are also at risk. Vietnam is negotiating to minimize tariff impacts while maintaining trade ties with the U.S.

Nike could soon face another blow in its effort to revive its brand and reverse a long decline in sales: U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce which countries and products he will target with a new round of tariffs aimed at encouraging domestic production and coaxing other nations to buy more U.S. goods.

Vietnam, which runs a $123.5 billion trade surplus with the United States, is a prime target.

Nike is one of several sportswear brands heavily reliant on Vietnam as a production site and higher tariffs would force the company to absorb higher costs or hike its prices at a time when it is already discounting some items to clear inventory.

Nike produced 50% of its footwear and 28% of its apparel in Vietnam in its 2024 financial year, according to its annual report. Rival Adidas is slightly less exposed, relying on Vietnam for 39% of its footwear and 18% of its apparel.

Live Events

The average U.S. tariff rate on footwear from Vietnam is 13.6%, while the rate on apparel is 18.8%, according to calculations based on January trade data made by Sheng Lu, professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.

""If tariffs are extended there, then Nike's got a problem,"" said Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Nike and Adidas are hardly alone. Vietnam has become a hub for high-tech running shoes, sportswear, and outdoor apparel as brands have sought to reduce exposure to China.

Lululemon, Columbia Sportswear and Amer Sports, which owns Salomon and Arc'Teryx, count Vietnam as their top manufacturing country.

But the potential tariffs come at a critical moment for Nike, which has lost market share of late to competitors viewed as fresher and more innovative, like On and Hoka. In a quarterly earnings call last month, Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said Nike's revenue was expected to continue to fall next quarter.

That outlook factored in current tariffs, said Mari Shor, senior equities analyst with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which holds Nike shares. ""But what if it gets worse?""

INDUSTRY BRACES FOR IMPACT

Some smaller, younger sportswear brands are even more exposed to Vietnam. Fast-growing running brand On in 2024 sourced 90% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel and accessories from the country.

On shoes are already expensive, selling for $130 to $330 a pair, and Samuel Wenger, the brand's chief operating officer, said tariffs were among the factors On considers when deciding on price. ""Our premium brand gives us the ability to adapt our pricing thoughtfully,"" he told Reuters.

Average U.S. prices of sneakers have already risen by 25% since 2019, partly because of rising production costs, said Beth Goldstein, footwear industry analyst at market research firm Circana. While U.S. sales of running shoes have risen 16% to $7.4 billion since 2021, according to Circana's Consumer Tracking Service, U.S. consumer confidence recently hit a four-year low, suggesting more price increases could prove hard to swallow.

Moving production out of Vietnam is no simple matter. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, could face tariffs too, and production costs are already rising there.

Factories in Cambodia are charging 5% to 10% more as they get more orders from retailers looking to shift production from China or Vietnam, said Michael Yee, CEO at apparel and accessories sourcing company MGF Sourcing in Hong Kong.

Nike, Adidas and Amer Sports declined to comment on questions about Vietnam tariffs. Lululemon and Columbia Sportswear did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. The good news, say experts, is that tariffs on imports from Vietnam - particularly for apparel - are unlikely to be as steep as those in China.

Leaders in Hanoi have taken several steps to stay in Trump's good graces, promising more imports from the U.S., lower duties, and allowing Starlink - the satellite company owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk - to offer its internet services in the country. The Trump Organization, meanwhile, is partnering with Vietnam on potential investments in hotel, real estate and golf course projects possibly worth billions of dollars.

""Vietnam has proven its ability to play the geopolitical game very skillfully,"" said T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Johannes Loefstrand, who runs a Frontier Markets Equity strategy weighted towards Vietnam stocks.

Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary in Trump's first administration, said the president had generally good ties with Vietnam and had no reason to hit it hard with tariffs that would be felt on main street.

""People notice the cost of apparel because they buy it fairly frequently,"" Ross told Reuters.

Earnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions.

For the month of March, we highlight CFO takes on tariff preparation from Lululemon, Nike, Five Below, Volkswagen, Traeger, Costco, Macy’s and Target.

1. Lululemon

Market cap: $33.85 billion

Date of call: March 27

Lululemon CFO Meghan Frank was asked about the impact of tariffs on the company’s business during the retailer’s latest earnings call. The company only sources about 3% of its products from the U.S. but says tariffs minimally impact it. Frank said her team has the flexibility to tweak internal costs or prices should tariffs exceed the impact she forecasted they would have on the business.

“In terms of tariffs, we've got approximately 20 basis points of a headwind embedded in our guidance, which is reflective of current actions on China and Mexico imports,” Frank said. “We’re closely monitoring the environment. We'll continue to look across our cost structure, as well as to pricing, you know, should the environment change. So, [we’re] definitely keeping a close eye on that.”

2. Nike

Market cap: $94 billion

Date of call: March 20

In a tough call, Nike CFO Matthew Friend provided a candid take on company performance. For reasons that have been widely speculated on, the global retailer continues to struggle as competitors grow. The company’s leadership is pushing its “Win Now” strategy and taking steps to reduce reliance on revenues from sneakers into other product lines.

When it comes to tariffs, Friend wasn’t asked about their impact by analysts and only mentioned them in his opening remarks. He said they’ve already been factored into planning and current investor guidance.

“We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. We expect Q4 SG&A dollars to be up low to mid-single digits, including restructuring charges in the prior year,” Friend said. “We will continue to tightly manage expenses while we increase investment to fuel our Win Now priorities, most notably demand creation.”

“We are focused on what we can control. And for Nike at this moment, serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum is what matters most. Our collective experience, as well as the early signals we are seeing with consumers, gives us confidence in the path ahead,” he said.

3. Five Below

Market cap: $4.15 billion

Date of call: March 19

As a large importer of goods from China, Five Below and its CFO, Kristy Chipman, are navigating uncertainty due to tariffs. However, she identified the retailer’s 3% same-store sales growth as a potential offset to tariff-induced costs by Q1 2026, which could improve margins by spreading fixed costs over more revenue. If they achieve this, along with continued improvement in shrinkage, it could help absorb rising costs on Chinese goods, which account for 60% of their total inventory.

“As we get into next year, if the tariffs remain the same and we get through the first quarter, sure. At that 3% comp, which is still our leverage point, we should start to improve [in Q1 2026],” Chipman said. “[One of ]the areas really that we're looking for [is] positive shrink. We're seeing improvement in our shrink rate right now. If we see that again when we count in August, there should be some benefit that we can see that will create leverage both in the back half of this year and into 2026… So, certainly tariffs make it complex right now.”

4. Volkswagen

Market cap: $54.42 billion

Date of call: March 11

Volkswagen, which is facing a range of challenges to its business, had CFO Arno Antlitz avoid going into detail on tariffs and their impacts during the company’s most recent earnings call. While the auto industry is expected to be one of the hardest hit by potential tariffs, Antlitz said it is too early to comment.

“[For our] 2025 guidance, we don't really [want to] guide on the potential impact of tariffs, much too early to say,” said Antlitz. “It's also too early to expect what our competitors will react, whether tariffs will come at all. So, this is really too early.”

5. Traeger

Market cap: $216.88 million

Date of call: March 6

CFO Dominic Blosil gave his final earnings call for Traeger as he is set to leave the grill-maker after more than a decade with the company. As both he and CEO Jeremy Andrus noted, most of the company’s components and accessories are manufactured in the United States, so they are unaffected by tariffs from a supply chain and cost standpoint. Blosil said the company’s domestic sourcing strategy should give their leaders confidence in both the integrity of their balance sheet and forecasts moving forward.

“In Q1, we've been focused on bringing in as much inventory as possible ahead of anticipatory tariffs. The increase in inventory at the end of the year is tied more to the Woodridge launch and the fact that there's continued load-in taking place ahead of peak season, which is just [our] normal seasonal inventory moves within this business as [we] think about launching new innovation, Blosil said. “I think the overarching theme here is inventory levels on our balance sheet and channel continue to be well balanced, and we feel confident in those levels.”

6. Costco

Market cap: $423.03 billion

Date of call: March 6

Costco CFO Gary Millerchip told analysts the company’s supply chain costs were slightly up due to their broader strategy on inventory and supply chain management in light of potential tariffs. The company’s strong margins also factored into this strategy. Millerchip noted that Costco’s core margin improved slightly despite rising supply chain costs. As a result, leadership is implementing a strategy of keeping inventory high to maintain competitive pricing.

“One of the things that was an increased cost during the quarter was higher supply chain costs as we have been continuing to buy more inventory, which we think will be helpful as you think about some of the unpredictability that we've seen in supply chain timing and also with the potential risk around tariffs,” Millerchip said. “And really, when we looked at the overall results for the quarter and saw that the core margin overall was going to be up slightly, we have that ability to be able to invest and ensure that we're continuing to take care of the members. So, we were quite deliberate on that this quarter.”

7. Macy’s

Market cap: $3.56 billion

Date of call: March 6

As the legacy retailer moves past accounting issues and widespread store closures, Macy’s CFO Adrian Mitchell — who will be replaced by Capri Holdings’ Thomas J. Edwards in June — spoke about inflationary pressures driven by tariffs. While CEO Tony Spring told analysts there are no pending impacts from tariffs yet, Mitchell said they are reinforcing the company’s focus on controlling internal variables.

“You know, there's a lot of changes that we're seeing day to day happening with tariffs,” said Mitchell. “We recognize the inflationary pressure. And obviously, there were some unexpected factors in the early part of the quarter with the fires and cold weather that impacted results for the business. But for the first quarter, you know, we expect that pressure to continue, and we're really focused on what we can control. The good news is that the investments that we're making in the customer experience are working, and what we're doing now is scaling those initiatives to a larger portion of our business.”

8. Target

Market cap: $47.79 billion

Date of call: March 4

Target CFO Jim Lee said he is taking a multifaceted approach to navigating tariff uncertainty. While he acknowledged the company’s historical experience sourcing at scale in volatile markets, he is also maintaining a “larger than normal” balance sheet to manage risk. Additionally, Target will no longer offer quarterly guidance to allow more flexibility if tariff-related changes arise.

""We plan to make some extra flexibility in the near term to help us navigate uncertainty regarding tariffs,” said Lee. “With a sourcing organization that's decades old, our team has a lot of experience in navigating this type of volatility. They're monitoring the situation carefully, and we expect to successfully navigate through any changes, just like we have in the past.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hq0XQ-H016hJznJlxigg981WaD09BBHTJLcQARzSuRk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01NDcxNjc0NTBfMi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-01 16:05:48.209358

They were the last achieved under outgoing CEO Martin and, in an unusual move, they were released internationally before being published in France.

The fact that recorded the same revenue in France in 2024 as in 2023, €4.73 billion, might have something to do with this time lag. Especially since, as a partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Decathlon benefited from huge media exposure last year in France, and invested heavily to be visible before and during the summer. However, selling approximately 1.8 million licensed products wasn’t enough to offset the twin impact of rising inflation and the gloomy consumption outlook in France.

Decathlon’s physical stores were the most affected, since the retailer has reported a 5.78% growth in online sales, which now account for 17.5% of its business in France. These figures are sure to raise the alarm with union representatives in the country, where Decathlon is part of a retail sector that is highly concerned about shrinking store fleets.

The Decathlon group, which has over 23,000 employees in France, seems to be aware of this element, and highlighted the fact that in 2024 it increased its store fleet by three, and now operates 320 stores across its various retail concepts, having invested €160 million in upgrading its stores.

International growth

However, stagnating sales in France, Decathlon’s main market, went hand in hand with a significant increase in the group's business outside France. At constant exchange rates, Decathlon's overall revenue increased by 5.2% to €16.2 billion. The previous year, growth was 4.4%, but the 2024 fiscal year included the Olympic Games and the men’s European Football Championship, two events which are usually major growth drivers for the industry.

Howard Schultz and Starbucks stick together like glue, but his journey with the company has been far from a straight line. Schultz has stepped away and returned to the company three times over the years aiming to reshape Starbucks into a global powerhouse. His leadership, vision, and strategic decisions have defined not just Starbucks but also modern coffee culture.

The First Build: Creating the Starbucks Brand

In 1981, Howard Schultz visited a small coffee shop in Seattle called Starbucks, which at the time sold coffee beans rather than the brewed drink we know for today. Schultz was inspired by the coffee culture observed in Italy, visioning Starbucks as a ""third place"" between work and home where people could gather and enjoy high-quality espresso beverages.

After joining Starbucks as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing in 1982, Schultz left in 1985 to start his own coffee company, Il Giornale, which mirrored the Italian espresso bar experience. Two years later, he acquired Starbucks, merged it with Il Giornale, and began expanding aggressively. Under his leadership, Starbucks introduced handcrafted espresso beverages, pioneered customer-centric service, and launched an iconic brand experience. By the late 1990s, Starbucks had expanded across the U.S. and entered international markets, becoming a household name.

The Second Build: Rescuing Starbucks from Decline

In 2000, Schultz stepped down as CEO, transitioning to Chairman, and Starbucks continued expanding. However, by the mid-2000s, rapid growth had led to a decline in quality, loss of brand identity, and financial struggles. Competitors like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts had entered the premium coffee space, and customer experience was deteriorating.

In 2008, Schultz returned as CEO to fix the struggling company. His first move was to refocus on quality and authenticity. He closed 7,100 stores for a day of barista retraining, removed inefficient automatic espresso machines, and revamped the company’s digital presence. Schultz also introduced the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, mobile ordering, and a renewed emphasis on social responsibility. His turnaround efforts revitalized Starbucks, and by the early 2010s, the company was once again thriving.

What's your go to Starbucks order?

The Third Build: A New Era and the Future of Starbucks

Schultz successfully revived Starbucks but decided to step down once again in 2017, handing the role to Kevin Johnson. If we couldn't see how much Schultz couldn't let go of the business, in 2022 he returned amid Starbucks' wave of challenges, including unionization efforts, economic shifts, and post-pandemic consumer changes.

His third tenure focused on addressing employee concerns, navigating the labor movement within Starbucks, and reinforcing the company’s commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainability. He also accelerated Starbucks' expansion into digital and drive-thru services, positioning the company for the future.

Conclusion

Howard Schultz’s repeated returns to Starbucks showcase his ability to lead, adapt, and innovate in an ever-changing market. His vision for Starbucks as more than just a coffee chain but a cultural and community-driven brand has been the foundation of its success. Though he has stepped away again, his influence continues to shape the company, proving that great leadership isn’t about building a company just once, but knowing when and how to rebuild it.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-04-01 10:01:46.075111

Decathlon also recorded a notable surge in store traffic, increasing 10% in France during the Olympics and 6.7% during the Paralympics.

For three consecutive years, the retailer has managed to grow its revenue while simultaneously reducing its carbon emissions, achieving a 13% reduction since 2021.

Almost half (48.5%) of items sold in its stores in 2024 were developed using eco-friendly design principles.

Decathlon also facilitated the sale of 1.35 million pre-owned products and conducted repairs on 3 million items through its extensive network of repair workshops.

The retailer reduced its single-use plastic packaging usage by more than 53.29% during the year, slashing the figure from 2,646 tonnes down to just 1,236t.

Decathlon has also solidified its dominance in rental services, capturing half of the market share in both Italy and Spain.

In August 2024, it committed €100m ($111m) over the coming five years in India to bolster its retail presence and enhance manufacturing capabilities.

A similar investment strategy is being deployed in Germany, where Decathlon plans to allocate up to €100m by 2027 to inaugurate new stores and refurbish existing ones.

Portfolio Updates

Rimba Raya Stream: On April 26, 2024, the Company announced that it was informed that PT Rimba Raya Conservation (""PT Rimba”), the local concession holder for the Rimba Raya project, had its Forest Utilization Business License (the ""Concession License”) revoked by the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the ""MOEF”). PT Rimba challenged the MOEF’s revocation of the Concession License, and in July 2024, the State Administrative Court of Jakarta (the ""Court of Jakarta”) reached a decision on PT Rimba’s claim and declared that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void. The MOEF appealed the decision of the Court of Jakarta and in September 2024, the State Administrative High Court of Jakarta (the ""High Court of Jakarta”) upheld the Court of Jakarta’s decision declaring that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void. The MOEF submitted an appeal of the decision of the High Court of Jakarta and as such, the decision of the High Court of Jakarta upholding that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void does not yet have permanent legal force. While the appeal process is underway, the interlocutory decision issued by the Court of Jakarta on May 16, 2024, requiring the MOEF to suspend the implementation of its decree in respect of the revocation of the Concession License, will remain in place.

In October 2024, InfiniteEARTH Limited and its Indonesian subsidiary PT InfiniteEARTH Nusantara, the project operators of the Rimba Raya project (collectively ""InfiniteEARTH”) delivered a notice of intent to abandon the project (the ""RR Notice of Abandonment”). Pursuant to the RR Notice of Abandonment, InfiniteEARTH claims that a Regulation entitled Regulation of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry Number 7 Year of 2023 issued on June 14, 2023 by the Indonesian Government (""Regulation No. 7 2023”), prohibits the issuance and transfer of carbon rights from PT Rimba to InfiniteEARTH. InfiniteEARTH claims that as a result of Regulation No. 7 2023, it has been unable to economically develop or continue to operate the Rimba Raya project and that this is a force majeure event under the Rimba Raya Stream. The Company has notified InfiniteEARTH that it rejects the assertion that Regulation No. 7 2023 is an event of force majeure and has commenced an arbitration seeking, among other things, an order that the RR Notice of Abandonment is invalid or void.

In October 2024, the Company commenced an arbitration administered by the International Centre of Dispute Resolution against InfiniteEARTH in accordance with the Rimba Raya Stream; and against the shareholders of InfiniteEARTH Limited in accordance with the Strategic Alliance Agreement (the ""SAA""). The arbitration has since been bifurcated into two arbitration proceedings, dealing with (i) the Rimba Raya Stream; and (ii) the SAA.

In October 2024, the Company also issued a Notice of Action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking declaratory relief against the principals of InfiniteEARTH Limited and their related entities, seeking to enforce its rights in relation to guarantees and non-competition agreements related to the Rimba Raya Stream and the SAA. Some of the defendants have counterclaimed. The dispute between the Company and InfiniteEARTH arises out of acts and omissions that the Company alleges are improper and in breach of the Rimba Raya Stream, the SAA and related agreements. Management of the Company believes that delivering the Notice of Arbitration and issuing the Notice of Action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice were important steps in preserving the Company’s legal and contractual rights.

As a result of the uncertainty of the duration and outcome of the appeal process in respect of the Concession License and the ongoing legal dispute between the Company, InfiniteEARTH and the founders of InfiniteEARTH, the Company has reclassified the status of the Rimba Raya Stream to ""Expired"". As at December 31, 2024, the Company has determined the fair value of the Rimba Raya Stream to be $nil.

Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream: In the third quarter of 2024, Fundación MarVivo Mexico, A.C. and MarVivo Corporation (collectively, ""MarVivo”) delivered a notice of intent to abandon the project (the ""MarVivo Notice of Abandonment”). Pursuant to the MarVivo Notice of Abandonment, MarVivo claims that the failure to transfer the concession rights from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (""SEMARNAT”), Mexico’s environment ministry, to the jurisdiction of Mexico’s National Commission for Protected Natural Areas (""CONANP”), constitutes an event of force majeure and that it is no longer economical to develop or continue to operate the project. The Company’s position is that the attempt to abandon the project constitutes a breach of the terms of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream. The Company has notified MarVivo that it rejects the assertion that the failure to transfer the concession rights constitutes an event of force majeure and that if MarVivo abandons the project or takes steps to wind-down, this will amount to a breach of the terms of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream. As a result of the MarVivo Notice of Abandonment and the assertions of MarVivo, the Company has determined the fair value of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream to be $nil as at December 31, 2024. The Company reserves all rights with respect to the agreements between the parties and intends to strictly enforce its legal and contractual rights under the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream.

Sustainable Community Stream: In the third quarter of 2024, the Company exercised its contractual rights to terminate the Sustainable Community Stream as a result of, among other things, the failure of the project operator, Will Solutions Inc., to meet its milestone related to the registration of its Ontario project and its failure to develop and implement the project in accordance with the project plan (including continued delays in project development activities and lower-than-expected project enrollments). As a result of the Sustainable Community Stream being terminated, the fair value of the Sustainable Community Stream was determined to be $nil as at December 31, 2024. The Company intends to strictly enforce its legal and contractual rights under the Sustainable Community Stream.

Cerrado Biome Stream: At the time of project registration, the project planned to expand the project to 80,000 hectares by incorporating more land parcels, and to generate approximately 13 million carbon credits over a 30-year project life. Enrollment of additional land parcels has been slower than anticipated, primarily due to declining demand and lower pricing for REDD+ carbon credits. As a result, the expected revenue from carbon credit sales has decreased, reducing the financial incentive for landholders to transition from agricultural production to REDD+ project enrollment. Currently, the project consists of two land parcels covering approximately 11,000 hectares, expected to generate 1.2 million carbon credits over 30 years; however, the actual number of carbon credits issued will depend on the project’s ability to attract additional landholders. Revenue shortfalls have been driven by delays in the Verra verification process and price volatility for credits issued by REDD+ projects.

Waverly Biochar Stream and Royalty: Following the accelerated payment of the final milestone payments in the second quarter of 2024, the project reached mechanical completion and first biochar production in the third quarter of 2024. However, additional technical challenges prevented continuous operation of the facility and have continued to delay full production capacity. The project is currently focused on securing additional funding to support commissioning, the initial facility audit, and the first output audit with Puro.earth. Verification was anticipated in the third quarter of 2025, with first issuance of carbon credits to follow immediately thereafter, but is now expected to be delayed.

In 2023, the Company announced an agreement to provide Microsoft Corporation with carbon credits from the Waverly Biochar Stream of up to 10,000 carbon credits per year. Under this agreement, the Company is committed to delivering a minimum quantity of credits on specified future dates. If the Company is unable to fulfill this commitment, Microsoft Corporation may request that credits be sourced from an alternative project of their choosing.

Community Carbon Stream: In 2024, the projects under the Community Carbon Stream issued over 1,600,000 carbon credits from the Mozambique cookstove project, the Uganda cookstove project, the Tanzania cookstove project, and the Uganda household safe water project. Additionally, the Community Carbon Stream generated $1.1 million in cash settlements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

On May 8, 2024, the Company amended the terms of the Community Carbon Stream resulting in, among other things, revising the Company's economic interest to provide for a tiered streaming structure which is adjusted as certain return on invested capital thresholds are achieved, and adjusting the portfolio composition and milestone payments to focus on the five strongest projects, three cookstove projects in Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda and two water purification projects in Malawi and Uganda.

Following the May 2024 amendment, the Company anticipates that the project's actual emission reductions will be materially lower than previously expected due to methodological changes and declining prices, which have reduced forecasted creditable unit deployments. Concerns over emissions reduction overestimation, additionality, and verification challenges have raised questions about cookstove credit quality, prompting methodological revisions as the market adapts to evolving buyer expectations. While these changes aim to enhance credibility, they have also reduced demand and driven down prices.

Nalgonda Rice Farming Stream: In December 2024, the Company delivered a notice to Core CarbonX Pte. Ltd. and its services provider, Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited that an event of default occurred and is continuing due to the failure of the project to reach development completion prior to June 30, 2024. While no further action has been taken at this time, the Company reserves all rights under its agreements.

The project was registered with Verra on February 10, 2025, using the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism Methodology AMS-III.AU: Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice cultivation in the VCS program (""AMS-III.AU”). Registration and first validation of the project was delayed when Verra temporarily inactivated AMS-III.AU as part of a broader review of validation and verification quality and began developing a revised rice-specific methodology to replace AMS-III.AU. During this review, Verra determined that certain projects identified as having quality issues with validations and/or verifications would remain on hold, but Core CarbonX’s projects, including the Nalgonda Rice Farming project, were approved for registration under AMS-III.AU.

Verra released the new VCS Methodology VM0051 (Improved Management in Rice Production Systems v1.0) on February 27, 2025, which the project plans to transition to for the second monitoring period. However, the project has already applied the guidelines required under the VCS Methodology VM0051. At this time, it is not known how the transition to the new methodology will impact the project, if at all.

As of December 31, 2024, approximately 32,000 landholders were enrolled in the project, covering 36,548 hectares of farmland. Enrollment remains ongoing, with a target of expanding to approximately 62,000 hectares. However, progress has been slower than expected due to registration delays, which have also postponed farmer compensation and, in turn, affected enrollment. The project was registered with Verra on February 10, 2025.

Enfield Biochar Stream: In April 2024, Standard Biocarbon Corporation (""Standard Biocarbon”) achieved its first biochar production. However, technical challenges have delayed the commissioning process. Standard Biocarbon is working with PYREG GmbH, the engineer and builder of the PYREG Machines, to resolve these issues as it scales toward full operating capacity. The project continues to collect operational data required for a facility audit and official registration with the Puro.earth carbon credit standard. Currently, the project is on care and maintenance while seeking additional funding to support commissioning, the initial facility audit, and the first output audit.

Azuero Reforestation Stream: On May 21, 2024, the Company, Microsoft Corporation and Rubicon Carbon Capital LLC (""Rubicon”) entered into a carbon credit streaming agreement, as amended on November 23, 2024 (the ""Azuero Reforestation Stream”) with Azuero Reforestation Colectiva, S.A. (""ARC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ponterra Ltd. (""Ponterra”), for a reforestation project located on Azuero Province, Los Santos Province, Republic of Panama. Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, ARC will deliver 13.5% of the carbon credits created by the project to the Company. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation has entered into an offtake agreement to purchase 100% of the Company’s carbon credits delivered under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream through to 2040. Carbon Streaming will also act as the sole marketer of ARC’s carbon credits not already committed to the co-investors under the Azuero Reforestation Stream.

Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, Carbon Streaming, alongside Rubicon and Microsoft Corporation, will fund 100% of project costs over seven years. The Company agreed to make an upfront deposit of up to $7.1 million with $0.3 million paid on closing, and additional milestone payments made as the project achieves planting and sapling survival milestones, and will receive 13.5% of total credits, which is expected to be approximately 438,000 carbon credits through 2052.

Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream: In January 2025, the Company received a Notice of Adverse Impact from Mast Reforestation SPV I, LLC (""Mast”) and the parent company of Mast, Droneseed Co. d/b/a Mast Reforestation under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream pursuant to which, among other things, Mast advised the Company that the Sheep Creek project has experienced significantly higher than expected mortality rates and that the surviving seedlings had exhibited slower than expected growth rates. As a result, Mast indicated to the Company that it no longer expects to deliver the Company the agreed-upon 286,229 carbon removal credits, referred to as forecast mitigation units (""FMUs”) under the Climate Action Reserve’s Climate Forward program under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream, as Mast no longer considers the existing Sheep Creek project plan and budget to be viable. The Company has formally responded to the Notice of Adverse Impact and requested that Mast respond to the Company’s significant concerns regarding, among other things, the timing of the delivery of the Notice of Adverse Impact, and the characterization of the cause of the adverse impact. The Company is continuing to evaluate all legal avenues available under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream. As a result, the Company no longer anticipates generating cash flow from the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream and has determined its fair value to be $nil as of December 31, 2024.

Feather River Reforestation Stream: In 2024, carbon credit market demand has generally shifted towards lower risk carbon credits. FMUs, which are designed to facilitate forward financing, inherently carry higher risk, leading to supply that has exceeded demand. FMU issuance is expected in 2025. However, given the uncertainties surrounding FMU sales, the Company has determined the fair value of the Feather River Reforestation Stream to be $nil as of December 31, 2024.

Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream: In March 2025, Mast delivered the Company a notice of termination of the Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream and the Baccala Ranch project, thereby confirming it will forego any plantings. The Company had not advanced any funds for the Baccala project and the closing of the Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream remained subject to customary closing conditions.

Amazon Portfolio Royalty: Following a corporate reorganization, Future Carbon assigned its interests in the Yellow Ipe, ABC Norte and Gairova projects (collectively the ""Ecologica Portfolio”) to Ecological Assessoria Ltda. and its affiliates (collectively ""Ecologica”), and retained the Rio Madeira Project, (the ""Future Carbon Portfolio”). To reflect this restructuring, the Original Amazon Royalty was replaced on April 17, 2024, by two new royalty agreements: one between the Company and Future Carbon for the Future Carbon Portfolio (the ""FC Amazon Royalty”), and another between the Company and Ecologica on the Ecologica Portfolio (the ""Ecologica Amazon Royalty”). Each agreement carried a purchase price of $1.5 million, maintaining the original $3.0 million investment. No additional funds were advanced by the Company as part of Future Carbon’s reorganization.

Bonobo Peace Forest Royalty: The royalty agreement was originally intended to convert into a stream agreement upon successful validation and verification of the project. However, due to political instability in the DRC, weakened market sentiment for REDD+ projects, and a significant decline in demand for REDD+ carbon credits, Carbon Streaming decided to halt further investment. The Company currently has no plans to proceed with a stream agreement.

The project has been seeking additional investment to support a renewed technical effort for registration under the new Verra VM0048 methodology. Given the material uncertainty surrounding fundraising for REDD+ project development, the early-stage nature of the project’s technical development, and persistent weakness in demand for REDD+ carbon credits, the Company has determined the fair value of the Bonobo Peace Forest Royalty to be $nil as at December 31, 2024.

Strategy

Carbon Streaming is currently focused on maximizing value from the existing portfolio of investments and pursuing all options to achieve that goal. During 2024, the Company has undergone changes to the Board and management, including the termination of certain consulting contracts, which reduced ongoing cash expenditure and streamlined decision-making. The Company continues to focus on its previously announced evaluation of strategic alternatives with a focus on maximizing value for all shareholders. These alternatives could include acquisitions, divestments, corporate transactions, financings, other strategic partnership opportunities or continuing to operate as a public company.

The Company’s carbon credit streaming agreements are structured to retain a portion of the cash flows from carbon credit sales, with stream-specific retention varying. Project partners typically receive the balance through ongoing delivery payments under the terms of each agreement. Cash flows are subject to fluctuations based on realized carbon credit prices and agreement terms. As the Company continues to evaluate its strategic direction, it remains focused on optimizing portfolio economics and managing exposure to market volatility.

Outlook

Carbon Streaming continues to reposition itself for success and for maximizing shareholder value amid ongoing challenges. In May 2024, as part of its ongoing corporate restructuring first initiated in 2023, the Company announced changes to its senior management and Board after constructive discussions with certain shareholders. The Company continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for the business and remains focused on cash flow optimization through the reduction of operating expenses and a reassessment of its existing streams and royalties. Building on the previous measures implemented by the Company to reduce ongoing operating expenses, further steps have been taken in recent months, including significantly reducing employee headcount, renegotiating and amending vendor agreements to lower costs, eliminating cash-settled director’s fees to the Board and terminating certain consulting contracts. As the Company’s broader strategy continues to evolve, these recent steps are expected to result in significant reductions to annualized ongoing operating expenses when compared to 2024.

While the Company aims to increase cash flow generation through the sale of carbon credits from several streaming agreements over the next year, there remains ongoing uncertainty regarding the evolving nature of carbon markets, including potential registry delays, project-specific issues, and methodology-related risks, in addition to impacts the industry may face as a result of general economic, political and regulatory conditions. In 2024, the Company has recognized a decrease in the fair values of the Rimba Raya Stream, the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream, the Sustainable Community Stream, and the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream to $nil as a result of the failure of the respective projects to meet their obligations under the stream agreements and ongoing legal disputes. The Company is actively pursuing all available legal remedies to protect its investments and enforce its contractual rights. Given the multiple ongoing litigation matters, the outcomes remain uncertain and could materially impact the Company’s financial position and strategic direction. Please refer to the ""Legal Proceedings” section of the Company’s most recently filed MD&A for further information.

Given the evolving nature of carbon markets and ongoing legal considerations, Carbon Streaming is focussed on maximizing value from the existing portfolio of investments and pursuing all options to achieve that goal.

For a comprehensive discussion of the risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could impact the Company’s strategy and outlook, including without limitation, changes in demand for carbon credits and Indonesian developments described herein, investors are urged to review the section of the Company’s most recently filed AIF entitled ""Risk Factors” a copy of which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

Non-IFRS Accounting Standards Measures

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss Per Share

The term ""adjusted net loss” in this news release is not a standardized financial measure under the IFRS Accounting Standards and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. These non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance, cash flows and financial position as prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards. Management believes that these non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures, together with performance measures and measures prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards, provide useful information to investors and shareholders in assessing the Company’s liquidity and overall performance.

Adjusted net loss is calculated as net and comprehensive loss and adjusted for the revaluation of carbon credit streaming and royalty agreements, the revaluation of warrant liabilities, the impairment loss on early deposit interest receivable, the revaluation of derivative liabilities, the revaluation of the convertible note, the impairment loss on investment in associate, the gain on dissolution of associate, and the corporate restructuring which the Company views as having a significant non-cash or non-continuing impact on the Company’s net and comprehensive loss calculation and per share amounts. Adjusted net loss is used by the Company to monitor its results from operations for the period.

The following table reconciles net and comprehensive (loss) income to adjusted net loss:

The London-listed company also revealed that profits slumped by almost a quarter during a “challenging” year due to continued weakness in the UK construction market.
Travis Perkins said the pace and rate of a recovery in the construction market is still “uncertain and will likely need further cuts to interest rates and an uplift to consumer confidence levels to stimulate a meaningful increase in demand”.
This was particularly driven by a 6.2% fall in revenues from its merchanting arm, linked to “depressed levels of UK construction activity”.
Geoff Drabble, chair of Travis Perkins, said: “Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the strength and timing of a recovery in UK construction activity, with more resources re-deployed into customer-facing roles, the group is now better placed to benefit from returning demand.","Travis Perkins has revealed a slump in sales as weaker pricing and waning demand impacted its builders’ merchants business.

The London-listed company also revealed that profits slumped by almost a quarter during a “challenging” year due to continued weakness in the UK construction market.

Travis Perkins said the pace and rate of a recovery in the construction market is still “uncertain and will likely need further cuts to interest rates and an uplift to consumer confidence levels to stimulate a meaningful increase in demand”.

It said pricing has stabilised in the merchanting operation but that sales volumes have continued to decline into the new financial year.

However, it pointed towards growth in its Toolstation business, which was buoyed by new stores.

It came as the group reported that revenues for the firm fell 4.7% to £4.61 billion in 2024 after it was impacted by price deflation and weaker trading volumes.

This was particularly driven by a 6.2% fall in revenues from its merchanting arm, linked to “depressed levels of UK construction activity”.

Meanwhile, its Toolstation business saw revenues improve by 2.5% for the year after it opened 17 new stores.

The group saw adjusted operating profits fall by 23.2% to £152 million for the year.

The company is currently searching for a new chief executive after it announced last month that Pete Redfern would leave due to ill health, six months into the role.

Geoff Drabble, chair of Travis Perkins, said: “Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the strength and timing of a recovery in UK construction activity, with more resources re-deployed into customer-facing roles, the group is now better placed to benefit from returning demand.

“This will be supported by disciplined capital allocation, focused on upgrading and protecting our core competitive advantages, and a clear customer-focused strategy owned by the leaders of the business.

“I am confident that this approach will provide attractive returns for shareholders over the medium-term.”",https://i0.wp.com/jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.34751942-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1440&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-01 03:59:31.788940

Freeport operates Indonesia’s Grasberg, one of the world’s largest gold and copper mines, and had been building a smelter in the country as part of an operating agreement with Jakarta officials. That smelter was damaged by a fire last year and was shut down.

However, Freeport said it received regulatory approvals on March 17, and had resumed concentrate export shipments from Indonesia, which had been temporarily restricted.

Freeport added that the average realized price for copper is expected to be roughly $4.40 per pound in the first quarter, compared with $3.94 per pound it realized a year earlier.

The miner will release its quarterly results on April 25. Analysts expect the company to post an adjusted profit of 22 cents per share for the first quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Calvin Klein's Penthouse Office and Studio in Chelsea to Hit the Market

Now the chief executive officer is looking for Bad Bunny to help take the company higher as it navigates an especially tricky regulatory and consumer environment.

Larsson has been on a multiyear journey to remake the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent with his PVH+ strategic plan. That plan touches every part of the company, but can be seen clearly in Calvin Klein’s latest tie-up with rapper, singer and record producer Bad Bunny.

“What you see now from us in Calvin Klein with the Bad Bunny campaign is really exciting,” Larsson said in an interview. “We lean into the strongest category in Calvin Klein — Calvin Klein men’s underwear. We put an enormous amount of innovation into the existing hero product.”

That includes the introduction of the company’s new Icon Cotton Stretch, updates to the fit and the “infinity waistband” that has no stitching.

“We continued that in a cut-through campaign with Bad Bunny, one of the most-streamed artists on Spotify,” Larsson said. “That creates cultural connection. You have us leaning into the category strongly, reinventing a hero product, connecting it to a breakthrough campaign.”

The CEO called the collective impact of that “massive.”

When the campaign launched on Calvin Klein’s Instagram this month, it reached more than 29 million users in the first 48 hours and added nearly 100,000 followers in the first week.

That echoed Jeremy Allen White’s attention-grabbing turn in his Calvins last year.

Tommy Hilfiger has also been busy, recently launching The Hilfiger Resort, a summer event on the Caribbean island of Canouan with Patrick Schwarzenegger, Madelyn Cline and Abby Champion. The launch garnered 160 million impressions in just 72 hours.

“We really tapped both brands into the zeitgeist,” Larsson said.

PVH is living in the moment, but that doesn’t mean the moment is necessarily easy.

“We had a strong [fourth quarter], strong holiday, in February we saw it slow down, especially in North America,” the CEO said. “And then it stabilized in March and came back a little bit.”

Easter will be telling.

For PVH, fourth-quarter net income fell 42.2 percent to $157.2 million, or $2.83 a diluted share, from $241.8 million, or $4.55, a year earlier.

But analysts were looking at adjusted earnings per share, which came in at $3.27 — 6 cents ahead of the $3.21 analysts forecast.

Revenues for the quarter ended Feb. 2 fell 5 percent to $2.4 billion — a 2 percent drop in constant currencies. The result included a 3 percent decline attributed to an extra week in the year-ago quarter.

That put the top line above the $2.3 billion analysts were expecting.

The global Calvin Klein business rose 1 percent in constant currencies while Tommy Hilfiger decreased by 3 percent in the quarter.

“It’s definitely a tough moment for retail in general,” Larsson said. “I believe it’s a really good moment for us, having two of the most iconic and beloved brands and step-by-step, month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter building more relevance into those brands. It puts us on a trajectory to where we set out to go.

“We are focusing on what’s within our control,” he said.

Larsson said the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed so far would not have a big impact of PVH’s business and are planned for in the company’s guidance.

For this year, PVH projected that adjusted profits per share would rise to $12.40 to $12.75, from $11.74 last year. That’s well ahead of the $11.56 analysts projected.

Revenues are projected to be flat to slightly up for 2025.

The company also plans to give something back to shareholders through an additional $500 million in share repurchases this year.

One big question mark is the company’s back and forth with the Chinese government, a topic the CEO plans to address on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.

China’s Ministry of Commerce made a preliminary determination in January that PVH engaged in improper practices related to the Xinjiang region, although the impact of that ruling is still not clear.

In 2021, PVH stopped working with factories that used cotton from Xinjiang, where more than a million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims are alleged to be under internment, with some forced to work.

""We remain highly focused on execution of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, which we believe has the potential to deliver landmark results that can establish AVIM therapy as a new standard of care for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension in patients already indicated for a pacemaker. We also believe it can lay the foundation for expanding use of AVIM-enabled devices to manage blood pressure and improve cardiovascular function for hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk,” commented David Hochman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Orchestra BioMed. “As we age, our arteries naturally lose elasticity and become stiffer, a process that increases the risk of cardiovascular problems and is linked to changes in blood pressure and heart function. One of the characteristics of this process is the development of diastolic dysfunction, a condition where the heart's ventricles cannot relax and fill with blood properly during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. Our late-breaking data in patients with diastolic dysfunction recently presented at THT showed AVIM therapy’s ability to significantly improve ventricular relaxation and passive filling, highlighting its potential to drive better clinical outcomes through blood pressure reduction, as well as improvement of cardiac function.""

“In parallel, we are encouraged by the progress of our Virtue SAB program as we actively prepare to initiate a U.S. coronary pivotal study with an updated trial design, currently under FDA review. The study is expected to randomize patients with coronary in-stent restenosis to treatment with Virtue SAB or Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon. We believe this design will optimally highlight the potential advantages of Virtue SAB’s proprietary design advantages which enables protected delivery of extended focal-release sirolimus without the need for a balloon coating,” continued Mr. Hochman. “With regard to our strategic partnership, we and Terumo are moving our negotiations into a formal mediation process. We believe this is the most efficient way to drive our relationship to a resolution, ideally during the second quarter of this year, ahead of potential initiation of the updated Virtue ISR-US pivotal study in the second half of the year.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights

Continued site activation and patient enrollment of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, in collaboration with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), evaluating the efficacy and safety of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy in hypertensive pacemaker patients.

Submitted a revised design to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the Virtue ISR-US pivotal study in coronary in-stent restenosis (“ISR”), which will randomize Virtue® Sirolimus AngioInfusion™ Balloon (“SAB”) against Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon; initiation is targeted for the second half of 2025, pending FDA approval of an amended investigational device exemption (“IDE”) which is expected to be secured in the second quarter of 2025.

To accelerate potential completion of ongoing partnership restructuring negotiations, Orchestra BioMed and Terumo have elected to enter a mediation process and are currently working on a procedural plan that would aim to conclude the mediation process in the second quarter of 2025.

Enhanced board of directors with the appointment of three highly experienced independent directors:

Christopher Cleary, former Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Medtronic, where he played a key role in establishing the strategic collaboration between Orchestra BioMed and Medtronic for AVIM therapy

John Mack, former President of Cardiac Surgery at Medtronic with extensive operational and strategic experience in the medical device industry

David Pacitti, Chief Executive Officer of Avanos Medical, former President of Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and Head of the Americas, Siemens Healthineers, with nearly 30 years of experience in cardiovascular device and procedural imaging

Strengthened senior leadership team with the appointment of Mark Pomeranz as Executive Vice President & General Manager, Interventional Therapies. Mr. Pomeranz has over two decades of experience in medical devices, with particular emphasis on cardiology and gastrointestinal verticals. He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of Motus GI Holdings.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2024

Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities totaled $66.8 million as of December 31, 2024. During the year, our cash inflows included approximately $15.0 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our Common Stock under a market sales agreement and approximately $15.0 million from the initial draw on our credit facility.

Net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets was $50.8 million during 2024, compared with $46.2 million for 2023, with the primary driver of this increase being increased cash outflows for research and development during 2024.

Revenue for 2024 was $2.6 million, compared with $2.8 million for 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased recognition of partnership revenues earned under the agreement with Terumo.

Research and development expenses for 2024 were $42.8 million, compared with $33.8 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional costs associated with the ongoing BACKBEAT global pivotal study.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 were $23.9 million, compared with $20.3 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based stock compensation.

Net loss for 2024 was $61.0 million, or ($1.66) per share, compared with a net loss of $49.1 million, or ($1.48) per share, for 2023. Net loss for the year-ended 2024 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, compared with $7.6 million for the same period in 2023.

About AVIM Therapy

AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized, pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) global pivotal study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.

About AVIM Therapy

AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized, pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) global pivotal study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.

About Virtue SAB

Virtue SAB is a patented drug/device combination product candidate in development for the treatment of certain forms of artery disease that is designed to deliver a proprietary, investigational, extended-release formulation of sirolimus, SirolimusEFR™, to the vessel wall during balloon angioplasty without any coating on the balloon surface or the need to leave a stent or other permanent implant in the artery. Virtue SAB demonstrated positive three-year clinical data in coronary ISR in the SABRE study, a multi-center prospective, independent core lab-adjudicated clinical study conducted in Europe. Virtue SAB has been granted Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA for specific indications relating to coronary ISR, coronary small vessel disease and peripheral artery disease below-the-knee. Orchestra BioMed has a strategic partnership with Terumo (Terumo, TSE: 4543), a global leader in medical technology headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, as well as Terumo Medical Corporation, its U.S. subsidiary, to collaborate on the global development and commercialization of Virtue SAB in coronary and peripheral vascular indications.

The BBC has been increasingly cash-strapped in recent years after two years when the licence fee was frozen and inflation rising.

The annual report said: “Despite strong growth from BBC Commercial, the BBC faces an unprecedented content funding challenge, as co-production partnerships with global streamers and media companies have reduced across the sector.

It also said it will “continue our ambitious programme of transformation to ensure the BBC is in the best shape to meet the challenges of a fast-changing media environment”, after having “a smaller, leaner workforce following an aggressive savings programme”.

It will continue to put out the investigative series Panorama on the morning of its evening broadcast, and “build on success” of having live broadcasts of current affairs programme Question Time on iPlayer.

Episodes of children’s news show Newsround, which is staying on CBBC and iPlayer, will be made available on YouTube for the first time.

The BBC is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI), while being wary of the technology’s “many risks”.

In the report, the corporation said it was “trialling” using AI to help its journalists create live text pages from football broadcasts, “which could enable us to cover many more games as live text pages, and using AI to create automatic subtitles for BBC Sounds”.

It also said the BBC World Service will develop pilot services in new languages, as well as “enhance our efforts to counter disinformation in response to the increasing threat and in light of others withdrawing from the fact-checking ecosystem”.

BBC chairman Samir Shah said: “The BBC’s role has never been more important, both here in the UK and around the world, to deliver trusted, impartial news in a world of disinformation; develop and promote the most compelling homegrown content; and be the place where people come together for unforgettable shared moments.

“The BBC board fully endorses this plan, as we plot the long-term future of this marvellous organisation and deliver for audiences for generations to come.”

The corporation promised to publish the findings of an independent review of its workplace culture after several controversies involving high-profile presenters and TV shows.

BBC director-general Tim Davie said: “We are focused on our mission to deliver value for all, through our journalism, our storytelling and our unique ability to bring people together.

“The UK’s creative industry continues to change rapidly, as does the world around us. This plan sets out how the BBC continues to evolve for audiences, both on and off air, but also how we will support and invest in the wider industry.”",https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/03/31/12/a05a4f0aadf12ac60223b81f2467f53bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQzNTA4MDUz-2.5253900.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,N,,2025-03-31 16:04:17.981766

Next up is the continued struggles of casual-dining chains, which was put in sharp relief by Bar Louie’s decision to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Is this a bad sign for the full-service category?

And in this week’s extra serving, senior editor Joanna Fantozzi joins to talk about Panera’s announcement that interim CEO Paul Carbone would lose the “interim” tag and lead the brand into the future — a future that seems to be driven less by quality and more by value and convenience.

Gain an edge with CNBC Pro LIVE , an exclusive, inaugural event at the historic New York Stock Exchange.
As a CNBC Pro subscriber, we invite you to join us for our first exclusive, in-person CNBC Pro LIVE event at the iconic NYSE on Thursday, June 12.","The first quarter has been a rocky one for Wall Street, with steep declines for electric vehicle giant Tesla and semiconductor play Broadcom – as well as standout performances from the likes of CVS Health and Philip Morris International. This quarter was plagued by mounting tariff fears from the new administration, which should all come to a head on Wednesday, April 2 — a date President Donald Trump has dubbed ""Liberation Day."" Investors are holding out hope that on Wednesday, they'll receive some clarity and relief from the high volatility wracking equities in recent weeks. The S & P 500 , Dow Jones Industrial Average , and Nasdaq Composite are all on pace to end the quarter with losses. The S & P 500 is off more than 5%, while the Nasdaq is down 11%, and both are tracking for their worst quarterly performance since 2022. The Dow is on pace for a 2% loss in the period. Here are the 10 biggest outperformers in the S & P 500 for the first quarter. Coming in at first place was pharmacy retailer CVS Health , which has rallied more than 50% this quarter. On Feb. 12, shares popped 15% in a single day after CVS posted a big beat on its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. All signs point to the once-struggling retail chain beginning to right the ship, especially after CEO David Joyner took the helm last October. Following its earnings blowout, analysts at both Cantor Fitzgerald and Leerink Partners upgraded the stock. ""The pieces are in place for [CVS to return] from what has been a bottoming of operations performance,"" wrote Leerink analyst Michael Cherny. Another winning name was Philip Morris International . Shares of the tobacco giant have surged 31% in the first quarter. Philip Morris is another stock that belongs to the consumer staples sector. Investors have increasingly flocked to the category for its defensive attributes as emerging tariff policies threaten to shake up global supply chains. Earlier this month, Argus upgraded the stock to a buy rating from hold, citing the firm's nicotine pouches — which are especially popular with younger populations — as a major catalyst. ""We see revenue growth ahead driven by PM's nicotine pouches as management is now better enabled to market this smoke-free product and is committing capital expenses,"" the firm wrote. On the other hand, Deckers Outdoors — which owns brands such as UGG, Hoka and Teva — led the quarter's losses, with its 46% decline. Earlier this month, the stock was trading at lows not seen since 2024, reinforcing recent sentiment surveys indicating that consumers may be growing increasingly bearish on the economy. Beleaguered electric vehicle maker Tesla , down 37% this quarter, came in second place. The stock has eroded much of its post-election gains as investors have increasingly grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's role in the new Trump administration. During a Sunday town hall event in Wisconsin, Bloomberg News reported that Musk said that his role within the newly created Department of Government Efficiency had hurt the stock . Debates have heated up between investors on whether Tesla's fundamentals have justified the stock's recent declines — or whether the market has unduly punished shares. In a recent note, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro reiterated his buy rating on Tesla, but cut his price target by $19 to $455. This updated forecast is still 72% above where the stock closed on Friday. ""We expect share price volatility to persist in the near term, but remain optimistic on TSLA's medium- to long-term prospects and reiterate our Buy,"" Gengaro wrote.

Consumer discretionary, the worst performing sector, and I talked earlier about what was the worst performing stock in the S&P overall, not just consumer discretionary.
That is the worst performing stock in the S&P 500.
It's joined by Tesla and Las Vegas Sands, which have also been the worst performers in consumer discretionary.
What I think is really interesting, obviously, CVS is down today, but it seems like the best performers in the S&P year to date so far are just the underperformers from last year.","It is the last day of the first quarter. So we want to take a look at some of the best and worst performing stocks and sectors of the year so far. Consumer discretionary, the worst performing sector, and I talked earlier about what was the worst performing stock in the S&P overall, not just consumer discretionary. It's Deckers, owner of Uggs and Hoka. That is the worst performing stock in the S&P 500. It's joined by Tesla and Las Vegas Sands, which have also been the worst performers in consumer discretionary. They shared teasers earlier, Maddie, um, you know, that that this company came out with its earnings earlier in February, disappointed, disappointed with its forecast, and the stock has not recovered since. In fact, it has just continued to go down, even though, um, analysts broadly still like it.

Great teas.

I ordered a pair of Hokas for one of my kids this weekend. We're a big Hokas household. Hoka sales actually were up 24% in the quarter that they reported, but still there's concern about what's going on with this company going forward. And consumer discretionary, obviously, when we're seeing these consumer sentiment surveys that are weak, yes, Tesla is a big weight within that sector, of course, but there's also a close eye that people are keeping on on these other stocks to see if they're being affected by all this.

And I wonder to what extent some of that negativity around tariffs is getting priced into some of those consumer discretionary names, and maybe the hope is that over time, the real impact is not going to be as bad as is getting priced in right now. Maybe a lift later, but of course we, that remains to be seen. I did want to take a look at the good news for the quarter here. CVS is the top performing stock in the S&P 500 so far this year with health care bouncing back from its position as the weakest sector in 2024 to the second best performer year to date, lagging only energy. What I think is really interesting, obviously, CVS is down today, but it seems like the best performers in the S&P year to date so far are just the underperformers from last year. So perhaps that's a little bit of a rebalancing versus any positive catalyst for this individual stock. I should mention CVS has gotten quite a few price target hikes as of late. They've now got about 70% of the street with a buy, 30% with a hold rating on the stock. So getting a little bit of more positive momentum off the back of thoughts about them being able to handle their balance sheet a little bit more effectively, um, some potential M&A activity moving forward here for the company, slashing bonuses as well. That was another positive catalyst over the quarter. Um, but no huge fundamental change in the business that has a growth story attached that would make it the best performer in the S&P.

Right. I mean, we know that some people have migrated to some parts of health care as a sort of defensive posture. So that could certainly be part of the situation as well. I believe they got a new CEO late last year, so there's also some hopes that he's going to start to turn the company around.

Yeah, health care, financials, energy, some of the safe havens amid.

On a relative basis.

On a relative basis. Very well said. Yes.

I guess so, yeah.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zLK3LxmFsVv72kVTcRMk8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/dcf286f0-0e36-11f0-b7f6-7125d41dddd1,N,,2025-03-31 12:23:00.992416

Sustainability suffers from mixed signals. Search trends are showing a renewed interest in plant-based options, particularly during festive periods, highlighting an opportunity for brands to align with consumer desires for ethical consumption. However, the decline in pre-loved clothing searches suggests that convenience is overshadowing sustainable choices, a gap that sustainable brands need to address by facilitating a seamless consumer experience.",https://www.publicisgroupeuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fav-50x50.png,N,,2025-04-01 03:00:07.382990
