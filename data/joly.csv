The bills would require third-party companies like Instacart and Shipt pay food delivery workers a minimum wage of $21.44 an hour or higher. That's the same rate restaurant delivery workers for apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash are currently paid.

The legislative package also includes making sure delivery workers get paid within seven days of the pay period ending, making sure customers have an opportunity to tip at least 10% before placing the order, and requiring companies pay workers when they log on, even if they aren't making deliveries.

Reactions mixed to grocery delivery worker bills

An Instacart delivery worker named Tommy M. said the bills are a start.

""It's still not enough, but I mean, it gives us hope,"" he said. ""It will be a pay increase, but it's not outrageous.""

Some shoppers outside a Key Food in Park Slope are in support of the bills.

""I think one of the things that's holding everything down is inequality, and so I would be all for it. I would be all for raising the minimum wage,"" shopper David Reed said.

Others worry increasing the minimum wage will increase grocery prices.

""I know it's going to. It's doing it already. Oh, definitely,"" shopper Susan Levy said.

Food delivery companies slam bills

Instacart and Shipt are both opposed to the bill.

An Instacart spokesperson said in a statement:

""It's simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on — particularly those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges. The city's own data shows that this bill could drive grocery delivery costs up by a staggering 46%, cut off access to work for thousands of NYC delivery workers, and increase fees on local grocers.""

A spokesperson for Shipt said in a statement:

""We urge the Council to reconsider these bills before moving forward. These bills were developed without input from grocery delivery workers about their desire for flexibility and without acknowledgment of their distinct experiences working with platforms like Shipt. Passing these bills as drafted could lead to unintended consequences that hurt both the very workers they aim to protect and families that depend on grocery delivery.""

A spokesperson for Uber said the company would not be commenting on what he called the ""forced tipping bill."" Right now, Uber only asks a customer for a tip after they have already paid.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/14/91676b56-2504-4fd7-b4b0-bd992cfd7c2d/thumbnail/1200x630/ef0969192c5b5dad7f3d03ec34fe9d0a/waller-11p-pkg-city-cou-wcbsegb3-hi-res-still.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:58:33.296789

According to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, there are an estimated 60,000 restaurant delivery workers in the city.
Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.
Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.
The suit was settled in 2025 after the City Council made adjustments to the law that created some exceptions to the cap.","– The New York City Council is expected to pass a package of Bills on July 14 expanding legislation that improved working conditions for food delivery workers to include nearly 20,000 grocery delivery workers.

A ground-breaking package of Bills passed in 2021 had set a minimum pay and addressed difficult working conditions for app-based food delivery workers, but only for those who delivered food from restaurants through apps such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. The minimum rate was fully implemented from April 1, 2025.

The new legislation will require third-party app companies such as Instacart and Shipt to pay grocery delivery workers a minimum of US$21.44 (S$27.46) an hour to match the increase the food delivery workers received in April.

The Bills, five in total, will also mandate that the companies provide an option in their apps to give at least a 10 per cent tip, before or at the same time an order is placed, and that the companies must pay workers within seven days of the end of a pay period.

The delivery industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, has continued to grow in New York City, with more than 100 million deliveries arranged through third-party apps. According to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, there are an estimated 60,000 restaurant delivery workers in the city.

“It’s a huge milestone to make app delivery work more dignified, better paid and safer in our streets,” said Ms Ligia Guallpa, a co-founder of the Worker’s Justice Project, a worker centre that organises low-wage, immigrant workers.

Her group organises Los Deliveristas Unidos, an advocacy group for delivery workers.

Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.

But, he added, “we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that these pay standards for delivery workers in New York City are the best pay standards that exist in the United States”.

Mr Juan Felipe, 30, a grocery delivery worker, said he had cut back working for Instacart because he was making only about US$2 to US$7 an hour, and he did not plan on rushing back any time soon even if the legislation was passed.

“If we get that rate, that would be amazing,” he said. “But we’ll have to see what it’s going to be like.”

Mr Felipe said he often parks outside big-box retail store Costco in Queens, one of dozens of gig workers waiting for possible jobs to appear in their apps.

Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.

“The apps are creating an environment that is unregulated, that doesn’t have a lot of worker protections,” Ms Nurse said. “Because a lot of these workers are immigrant workers, there’s just a lot of opportunity for exploitation.”

On July 12, Grubhub said in a statement that it was working with advocacy groups and the City Council “to make sure New York’s delivery workforce is protected without sacrificing the flexibility customers expect”.

Instacart said in a statement: “At a time when millions across the city are already struggling with rising costs for food and daily essentials, we urge the City Council to consider the real-world consequences this Bill could have on the families and communities that depend on grocery delivery the most.”

Uber and DoorDash did not reply to a request for comment.

In 2023, Grubhub, along with DoorDash and Uber Eats, filed requests for a temporary restraining order just days before an initial increase of the minimum wage for food delivery workers, to US$17.96 per hour, was to take effect. The requests contended that regulators used inaccurate data to calculate compensation.

A judge ruled against the three food delivery companies, allowing the city to raise the workers’ minimum wage to nearly US$18, and increase it further to US$20 or more in 2025.

The three companies had also filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that the city’s 15 per cent cap on fees charged to restaurants for online orders and 5 per cent cap for other fees was unconstitutional and prevented them from negotiating their own prices with restaurants.

The suit was settled in 2025 after the City Council made adjustments to the law that created some exceptions to the cap.

Although legislation would signify a victory for delivery workers, Council member Shaun Abreu, a Democrat and a sponsor of three Bills in the new package, said he had noticed forms of “retaliation” from third-party apps, like randomly deactivating workers’ accounts and removing the tipping option at checkout.

Mr Abreu said he planned to introduce legislation to prohibit the abrupt deactivation of delivery workers’ accounts by major third-party apps.

Mr William Medina, 37, who delivers for Uber Eats and is a member of Los Deliveristas Unidos, said he was very concerned about the “thousands” of delivery workers whose accounts had recently been deactivated.

“This is a very critical issue,” Mr Medina said. “We just need somebody, a real person who can mediate between the company and the worker on the deactivation process.” NYTIMES",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/554c2a35204da37279e95df54491658a20f554b21226cfe769924874d5514430,N,,2025-07-14 00:58:38.749266

Hybrid work could potentially improve productivity, reduce employee turnover, and lower business costs like real estate for as much as 55% according to a survey by the International Workplace Group (IWG) and global engineering consultancy Arup.

Citing a US-modelled survey, the study revealed that hybrid working could generate $282b in Gross Value Added (GVA) annually by 2030 and $729b by 2045, through increased productivity, reduced turnover, lower replacement costs, and portfolio savings.

Productivity could also improve by 11% driven by lower commutes, with employees benefiting from increased focus time and fewer distractions, ultimately spending up to 40% of time saved from travelling on additional work. In fact, the rate of employees reporting their productivity levels as ‘excellent’ in flexible workspaces is 67% higher than those working from home.

The report estimates that this could unlock $54.4b in annual GVA within five years, rising to $140.3b by 2045.

In a previous IWG study, 77% of Gen Z workers in Singapore reported higher job satisfaction under a hybrid model, with 34% saying their work-life balance improved.

IWG estimates that employees working closer to home can save up to $39,400 annually by avoiding daily commutes. Businesses that shift to local hubs or coworking memberships can cut real estate costs by up to 55%. A Knight Frank survey found that 30% of Singapore business leaders consider flexible work a core factor in real estate decisions.

Singaporean consumers are looking beyond transactional perks and demanding emotionally rich, experience-driven engagement from brands, according to the newly released Collinson 2025 Asia-Pacific Consumer Happiness Report.

81% of Singaporeans rely on brands for rewards and benefits to access unique or exclusive experiences.

This trend is particularly strong amongst younger demographics in APAC, with 89% of Millennials and 86% of Gen Z preferring experiential benefits over transactional ones.

Despite this appetite for deeper brand engagement, satisfaction levels with current offerings are only moderate. Sixty-five percent of Singaporeans say they’re happy with brand rewards, higher than the APAC average of 53%, and above markets like Japan (36%) and Australia (54%), but still below top performers like Indonesia (86%) and India (80%).

The report also highlighted emotional value is increasingly becoming the new standard for consumer happiness, with 60% of APAC respondents saying they prioritise rewards that strengthen their relationships with family and friends, as opposed to self-focused or material perks.

Why Cindy Rose?
All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.
In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft.
This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.","On Thursday this week, British advertising giant WPP announced that it will appoint board member Cindy Rose as the new Chief Executive Officer. According to the relevant announcement, the new CEO will officially take office on September 1st, which means that Mark Read, the current CEO of WPP, will leave his position four months earlier than originally planned.

Notably, one day before the announcement, WPP released an unscheduled financial report update, significantly lowering its full - year performance forecast, which caused the stock price to plummet by 18.09% in a single day, the largest single - day decline since 2020. This is likely to make people have some associations - Mark Read is most likely to be held accountable for WPP's declining performance.

After all, 2025 can almost be said to be a year when WPP's performance suffered an unprecedented setback. First, in March this year, WPP lost Coca - Cola's North American media business. Subsequently, Paramount also announced the end of its 20 - year partnership with WPP. In June this year, Mars, the fast - moving consumer goods giant, also chose to transfer its $1.7 billion advertising business covering more than 70 different markets around the world to Publicis Groupe.

This means that in just one year, WPP has lost several long - term giant clients. This is obviously not a good sign. After all, most brands do not change their agents frequently, which means that WPP may not be able to regain these lost orders for at least the next 3 - 5 years.

In addition to the lost clients, the competitive pressure WPP faces is also increasing. Even if we don't mention the digital advertising sector that has been continuously squeezed by various Internet companies, in the traditional agency field, with the completion of the merger of Omnicom and IPG, WPP will obviously face more challenges in the second half of the year.

At this time, the only good news may be that with WPP's announcement of a leadership change, WPP's stock price immediately rebounded in the short term, rising 3.58% to $30.39 in pre - market trading. This relatively positive signal seems to indicate that the market views this appointment as a relatively positive sign. Of course, from a pessimistic perspective, it may also be that the market believes that WPP's current dilemma has reached its limit, and as long as there is a change, it may be a good thing.

So, who exactly is WPP's new CEO? Why does WPP's board of directors believe that Cindy Rose will be the key leader to pull WPP out of the mire?

Why Cindy Rose?

All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.

In fact, looking at Cindy Rose's entire work experience, we will find that her career path is very different from that of the current CEOs of other 4A groups. Whether it is Arthur Sadoun, the CEO of Publicis Groupe, or John Wren, the CEO of Omnicom Group, they almost all worked in advertising companies before joining their respective groups. Hiroshi Igarashi, the current CEO of Dentsu, has been working at Dentsu since graduation and took over as CEO in 2017.

In contrast, Cindy Rose's work experience is almost entirely cross - industry. After joining Disney in 1995, she spent 15 years working her way up to the senior vice - president of the Interactive Media Group in the EMEA region (a combination of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In 2010, she joined Virgin Media in the UK and promoted the innovative model of bundling broadband and TV services. Then in 2014, she joined Vodafone, an old rival of Virgin and one of the world's largest mobile communication companies, to be responsible for the transformation of its mobile communication business. In 2016, she joined Microsoft as the president of Western Europe and the CEO of the UK, and in 2023, she became the chief operating officer of its global enterprise business, leading the digital transformation strategy in the European market.

If we analyze further, we will find that whether it is Disney, Vodafone, or Microsoft, these companies seem to be ""digital industrial companies"" in their respective fields. Disney can be said to be the first traditional film and television company to accept and try the streaming media business. Vodafone has the world's most complete enterprise information management system and customer service system. In fact, many people believe that this is the key for Vodafone to maintain its strong competitiveness.

Microsoft is even more of Cindy Rose's career peak. If we organize the relevant information, we will find that from 2020 to 2023, in just three years, Cindy Rose promoted the implementation of the ""cloud - first"" strategy in 17 Western European countries at the strategic level, increasing the market share of Azure cloud services in this region by 8 percentage points in three years. She also established Microsoft's first industrial AI R & D center in Munich.

In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft. On the one hand, she designed a new operating model called ""Customer Success Units"", restructured the global enterprise customer service team into 12 industry vertical units, and promoted the in - depth integration of the sales and technology teams, shortening the solution delivery cycle by 30%. She also participated in optimizing the product roadmap of Azure Stack HCI and designing the architecture of the multi - cloud management solution.

As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said when evaluating her - ""Cindy Rose successfully brought Microsoft's global enterprise business into a new AI - driven stage.""

This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds. So, is this new CEO really suitable for WPP at present? Or why has she become the ""savior"" in the eyes of WPP's board of directors, and why are they so eager to have her become the new captain of WPP, this advertising giant?

Is WPP in a Mess?

Obviously, WPP's current dilemma is exactly the type that Cindy Rose is good at. But to explain this in detail, we need to go back to an earlier time.

In 2018, Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP, left the advertising empire he built. Mark Read became the second captain of WPP. However, the advertising group he faced at that time was not an aggressive and united one. On the contrary, due to Sorrell's radical merger and expansion strategy in his era, WPP at that time was a huge organization formed through capital integration and mergers, with more than 400 agencies covering multiple marketing fields such as advertising creativity, media placement, public relations, and market research, in different regions and sub - fields.

This made the recognition of the group brand even lower than that of its well - known agencies in many cases. A current executive of WPP once told the American financial media ""Business Insider"": ""WPP has long been regarded as an investment tool aimed at acquiring agencies and rewarding shareholders. To put it bluntly, it has a rather 'dispersed and chaotic' atmosphere.""

Of course, in Sorrell's era, this chaos did not really affect the company's performance. After all, at that time, the clients were also in a state of disunity. Different clients in different industries and fields had almost completely different ideas, which meant that for WPP at that time, even if it could integrate different agencies into a perfect whole, it was still difficult to form effective synergy.

However, with the increasing popularity of digital marketing, especially the rapid maturity of discriminative AI, data - driven digital marketing has gradually become the most important channel in the marketing industry. At this stage, as Internet companies began to build their own walled gardens through data, WPP's traditional decentralized model made it difficult for the group to fully integrate the data and technical capabilities of different agencies. Not to mention the low efficiency in communication and collaboration caused by this traditional decentralized structure.

As the global CMO of Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, once complained at the American Advertisers Conference:

""Too much management, high rent, and indirect costs of many advertising groups make advertisers feel overwhelmed. The business of agencies has become more complex, with layers of account managers to convey information, resulting in advertising companies no longer focusing on creativity, and spending too much time on phone conferences, off - site activities, business trips, and PPT presentations.""

And this was exactly when Mark Read officially took the helm of WPP in 2018. Perhaps Sorrell realized that he could no longer drive WPP, the world's largest advertising group at that time, into deeper waters with old methods in the new era, so Read became the new captain.

From today's perspective, the strategic approach Read formulated at that time did conform to the direction of market evolution. On the one hand, he promoted in - depth integration within the company, proposing ""One Company, Not a Group"", and merged many well - known agencies except Ogilvy to some extent. He even sold the equity of some agencies and non - core businesses.

In 2025, he restructured the media agency brand GroupM into a unified entity called ""WPP Media"", laid off up to 40% - 45% of the staff, and brought media subsidiaries such as Mindshare and Wavemaker under unified management. At the same time, he began to acquire a large number of technology companies and made heavy investments in the AI field, investing nearly £300 million per day. He built a self - developed intelligent marketing operating system called WPP Open, which integrates the full - link capabilities of creative production, media placement, and data analysis and embeds generative AI tools.

As for the final effect, opinions vary. Many current and former employees of WPP have complained about Read's decision to discontinue many well - known creative brands. For example, in November 2018, Wunderman and JWT (J. Walter Thompson) merged, and the JWT brand became history.

A former employee of Ogilvy told Morketing: ""This move is as ridiculous as deleting Lincoln from American history.""

However, there are also positive aspects. As the most heavily invested intelligent marketing operating system in WPP's history, by March 2025, WPP Open could cover 48,000 employees (60% of the customer service team), generate 130,000 personalized advertisements for Cadbury's Indian market, reach 94 million people, and reduce costs by 90%.

However, Read still failed to solve the old problems of organizational bloating and cumbersome processes caused by WPP's years of mergers. But the era has once again reached a new crossroads. The era of artificial intelligence is just around the corner, and the confrontation between technology giants and advertising groups has reached a critical moment. As a person with rich experience in technology giants and corporate transformation, Cindy Rose, just like Mark Read when he took over the helm from Martin Sorrell in 2018, has become the new helmsman of this huge ship.

And the problems WPP is facing now are exactly what she is good at, just like the work she did during her tenure as the chief operating officer at Microsoft - through organizational structure reform, deeply integrating the sales, technology (and now creativity) teams, and shortening the entire advertising production and delivery cycle. At the same time, truly commercializing AI and integrating it into the group's processes.

Her experience is a key asset that WPP Group urgently needs to cope with industry changes.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250712/v2_50cee8dd35674dea8d0f4e7585adb984@000000@ai_oswg387546oswg1536oswg722_img_000~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:00:53.082222

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.
Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J.
“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.","New York: Kraft Heinz Co is looking to spin off a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as US$20bil on its own, the Wall Street Journal reports.

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

News of the potential move was the second effort last week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier last week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a US$3.1bil buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.

The company’s shares closed up 2.5%. It currently has a market value of US$31.33bil.

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for the company’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the United States after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

According to the Wall Street Journal report last Friday, a split could be finalised in the coming weeks, but Kraft Heinz has discussed other scenarios with its advisers and its board has not signed off on a final decision.

The company is also working on which brands would be part of the spun-off entity, the report said.

“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

“As consumer packaged goods makers (CPGs) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to mergers and acquisitions and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,” Rattigan said. — Reuters",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/07/14/3415065.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:26.271879

NEEDHAM, Mass– PC shipments during the second quarter of 2025 grew 6.5% from the prior year, with global volumes reaching 68.4 million shipments, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker.

Despite PC market growth in other geographies, the US market is starting to feel the pinch of import tariffs.

“We expected the US market to cool down this quarter given the inventory buildup to begin the year, but what we’re witnessing here might highlight US PC demand slowing down in anticipation of the import tariffs looming deadline,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Despite a flat US PC market, the rest of the world demonstrated an appetite for PCs, fueled by an aging installed base and by a steady transition to Windows 11.”

“We realize growth in such an indeterminate market seems odd, but many factors come into play supporting the momentum,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers. “The supply side of the industry is doing its best to navigate the unknowns as no one wants to sit on their heels and potentially miss an opportunity, but at the same time it is very risky carrying inventory which is a possibility given the strong first half sell-in. The bigger concern is what overall demand looks like as we get late into Q3 and beyond. Price increases will likely be dispersed over time and geography depending on vendor strategy which can potentially lead to some attractive promotions as a way to clear inventory backups, which seems odd at a time when prices are expected to rise because of tariffs.”

Getting one of those coveted cards from a friend, a job, or even buying one for yourself can come in handy during a caffeine crisis. But for Starbucks, selling credit for its coffee and other offerings ahead of time is big business. We're talking billion-dollar business, because that's what customers routinely leave on their cards at any given time.

Quartr reports that, in 2023, the stored value of Starbucks cards sat at a whopping $1.6 billion. This includes both physical and digital cards, which are stored on the mobile app. So, it's safe to say that, much like the popular practice of customizing your drink order, Starbucks is a big fan of gift card purchases, because all that unspent Starbucks card money is like a loan that the company doesn't have to pay interest on.

The Starbucks Q4 2024 fiscal report put the stored card value at $1.78 billion at the end of 2024, which means that the amount of money held on Starbucks cards has continued to increase every year except for a slight dip in 2019 and 2020 (per Quartr). To put this into perspective, that's enough money on Starbucks cards to buy every single person in the U.S. an Iced Tall Cinnamon Dolce Latte, though they'd have to cover their own tax.

Much of the Starbucks stored card value is actually the balance that customers keep on the mobile card on the app. That way, even if they don't have cash or available money on a debit card, they can still get that coffee fix. The Starbucks mobile app has been around for over 15 years now, and it's seen some massive changes. When it first started, the app could tell customers about store locations, the Starbucks menu, and had a drink builder to assist with ordering. Now, it serves as a mobile Starbucks card that you can use to pay for drinks in the app or in the store. It also tracks Starbucks Rewards that are earned when making purchases.

You can add physical gift cards to the app, too, so that even if the card gets lost, the cash on it doesn't. While it's hard to say how much of Starbucks' stored card value comes from the mobile app, CNN Business reports that 70% of the coffee company's sales come through the mobile app and drive-thru. We can definitely see why using the app to order drinks and other items from Starbucks is so popular.

OTB Group’s slogan, “Be Responsible.","OTB Group, the global fashion and luxury conglomerate behind brands such as Diesel, Maison Margiela, Jil Sander, and Marni, has released its 2024 Sustainability Report. The document showcases the Group’s continued evolution of a sustainability-centered management strategy, highlighting measurable achievements across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions.

The report outlines comprehensive progress across key areas, including a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, expanded use of renewable energy, increased adoption of certified materials, enhanced product authentication through blockchain technology, and impactful initiatives in human capital and community engagement.

31% Emissions Reduction and 100% Renewable Energy in Europe and North America

On the environmental front, OTB reported a 31% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) compared to 2023. In addition, all directly managed sites in Europe and North America—including offices and stores—achieved 100% renewable energy usage. Globally, the share of renewable energy reached 70%, and the Group’s emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a global standard for climate action in business.

Expanding the Use of Certified and Low-Impact Materials

Progress was also evident in sustainable sourcing. In 2024, 24% of all raw materials purchased by OTB were certified. Notably, preferred cotton—organic, regenerative, and recycled—accounted for 62% of total cotton use, marking a 31% increase from the previous year. This shift reflects a Group-wide commitment to circularity, transparency, and responsible design embedded across its brand portfolios.

Blockchain-Based Authentication and Anti-Counterfeiting Efforts

OTB has also advanced in its technological initiatives. As a Steering Member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium alongside LVMH, the Prada Group, and Cartier (Richemont), OTB issued over 1.8 million digital certificates of authenticity between 2022 and 2024 for products from Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni. These certificates allow customers to verify product authenticity and trace origins via smartphone.

In parallel, the Group intensified efforts to combat counterfeiting. In 2024 alone, more than 23,000 illicit pieces of content were removed from social media, and over 60,000 counterfeit listings for its brands were taken down from online marketplaces.

Diesel’s Circularity Strategy Earns International Recognition

Diesel continues to lead the charge in circular fashion. Its initiatives—including Diesel Rehab Denim and Diesel Second Hand—along with a recycling collaboration involving its supply chain and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), earned the brand the Circular Economy Award from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation during the 2024 Sustainable Fashion Awards hosted by the National Chamber for Italian Fashion.

Gender Equity, Talent Development, and Corporate Volunteering

OTB’s investment in human capital remains central to its strategy. In 2024, the share of women in managerial roles reached 54.7%, enabling the Group to renew its gender equality certification. Meanwhile, the internal training program “Scuola dei Mestieri” continued to support the next generation of Made in Italy artisans, with over 85% of participants hired by OTB companies.

The newly launched “Brave to Care” corporate volunteering program also saw participation from over 130 employees, who contributed more than 700 hours of service to eight charitable organizations across Italy. The initiative further strengthens the link between the company, its people, and the communities it serves.

Multi-Layered Social Impact through OTB Foundation

The OTB Foundation continued to serve as the cornerstone of the Group’s social responsibility agenda in 2024. Key projects included the “OTB Chiama Alice” free online mental health service for youth, the expansion of support for families in economic hardship, and refugee integration through employment-focused programs.

One standout initiative was “Brave Business in a Bus,” the first mobile incubator supporting female entrepreneurship in Afghanistan. The program enables women in Kabul to launch small businesses from home by providing comprehensive training, business tools, and practical lessons.

OTB Group’s slogan, “Be Responsible. Be Brave,” is more than just a catchphrase—it functions as a core value embedded in the company’s foundation. By driving transformation across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, OTB presents a compelling model for what the next phase of sustainability in the fashion industry can look like.

The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.","(The Hill) — Hospitals are bracing for the impact of the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s sweeping spending and tax cut law.

While most of the cuts won’t happen immediately, rural facilities in particular say they likely will have to make difficult financial decisions about which services they can afford to keep and which may need to be cut.

Hospitals loudly raised alarms about the legislation, but their warnings went unheeded, and now they say they will bear the brunt of the changes.

The new law cuts about $1 trillion from Medicaid, primarily through stringent work requirements as well as reductions to how states can fund their Medicaid programs through provider taxes and state-directed payments.

Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid funding because many of the patients they care for are low-income.

“Restrictions on state-directed payments and provider taxes cut off critical financial lifelines for hospitals,” Bruce Siegel, president and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals, said in a statement.

“State-directed payments are a critical source of support for hospitals, particularly in rural areas, and provider taxes help reduce the gap between Medicaid and other payers, ensuring that physicians can take Medicaid patients and hospitals can be adequately staffed. Cutting these lifelines is not sustainable, and it will harm patients.”

More than 300 rural hospitals in the U.S. are at risk of closing down because of the bill, according to research conducted by the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center for Health Services Research and released last month by Democratic lawmakers.

Rural hospitals already operate on thin margins. The law’s Medicaid cuts will lead to more uninsured patients, meaning rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients, according to the report. In turn, they will face deeper financial strain.

Medicaid-dependent services — like labor and delivery units, mental health care, and emergency rooms — are some of the least profitable, yet most essential, services that hospitals provide. But experts said those will likely be cut as hospitals try to stay afloat.

In rural communities, Medicaid covers nearly half of all births and one-fifth of inpatient discharges, according to health research group KFF.

Republicans pushed back the start date for the provider tax reductions until 2028, and they won’t be fully phased in until 2031. The bill was only signed into law on July 4, so hospitals said it’s too early for them to know specifics on which services they’ll have to cut back on.

But the discussions are underway because hospitals need to start planning.

“If they see a very negative outlook in terms of Medicaid revenue reductions, increases in uncompensated care costs, I think that will tip the scales towards cutting services, cutting staff, not hiring, not expanding,” said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

Mark Nantz, president and chief executive officer of Valley Health System, oversees a network that includes six hospitals in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia, ranging from a 495-bed regional facility in Winchester to a 36-bed facility in Front Royal, about 70 miles outside of Washington.

Nantz said Medicaid expansion and provider taxes have allowed the system to break even when taking care of Medicaid patients. Previously, they were losing about 25 cents on every dollar.

Once the cuts are fully phased in, Nantz said Valley Health will lose about $50 million a year in revenue for Medicaid patients. The most likely casualty will be new construction and expansion plans, but he said it’s too early to know more.

“We’re not in a situation where we need to knee-jerk because we’re a pretty stable healthcare system, but it’s definitely going to change the way we look at expanding and the types of services that we offer in our six hospitals,” Nantz said.

Valley Health was able to expand the services it offers because it was not losing money on Medicaid, but that may not be able to continue. While hospitals may not close, some types of specialty care may be moved from rural facilities and centralized at the regional facility.

“We’ve got, really, two and a half to three years to make those kinds of decisions and prepare for what we will do. So we’re not threatening to cut jobs or hospitals or service locations or any of that right now,” Nantz said. “But we have to look at whether or not we can continue” offering the same types of services.

Republicans concerned about the impact of the provider tax reduction on rural hospitals inserted a $50 billion relief fund into the law. The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.

The federal government will distribute half of the program’s $50 billion allotment equally among all states with an approved application over the next five years.

But experts said the money isn’t nearly enough to make up for the impact of the cuts. According to a KFF analysis, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is estimated to decline by $155 billion over a decade.

The states and hospitals that will be hit the hardest will benefit the least, Park said.

He noted the law gives the Trump administration a lot of discretion on how they divide up the funds, so there’s potential for favoritism.

Every state has until the end of 2025 at the latest to apply for funds by submitting a “detailed rural health transformation plan” that addresses the program’s aims, according to the legislation.

But if CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz doesn’t agree with how states are using their funds, the law says he then “may withhold payments to, or reduce payments to, or recover previous payments from, the State.”

“It’s a fig leaf,” Park said. “The fund is temporary. These cuts are permanent.”",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/07/AP25182757035200-e1752430683233.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:04.870775

A grave security bug was discovered in the hiring portal McHire, revealing the sensitive information of around 64 million applicants.

The most surprising aspect of this revelation was that the exceedingly ordinary and foreseeable password '123456' was employed on this system.

Security expert Ian Carroll and Sam Curry uncovered this security flaw. They discovered that there was an option to log in as ""Paradox team members"" on the admin panel of McHire. In it he attempted the default password and username '123456' and got access not only to the test server, but also the actual admin dashboard.

The McHire platform uses an AI chatbot named Olivia, which handles candidate screening and interaction. But due to this bug, it became possible to access the chat history, name, email, phone number, and application details of the applicants.

The researchers found an internal API endpoint from which information about any candidate could be obtained by entering only one predictable parameter. Not only this, some tokens were also found with the help of which any person could present himself in the identity of a candidate.

As soon as this report came out on June 30, McDonald's and its AI tech partner Paradox.ai took immediate action. By July 1, the default login credentials were disabled, and the related API was secured.

Maybe you still do.

The bi-weekly pay structure is how millions of Americans get paid, yet this structure is a huge stressor for lots of people.

💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵

With a paycheck always a few days or weeks ahead, one unexpected expense, like a car repair or a medical bill, can mean an overdraft at the bank or a massive credit card bill that is hard to repay.

The bi-weekly pay structure is also one reason companies like Dollar Loan Center, MoneyMutual, and Advance America — businesses that offer short-term “paycheck” loans — have thrived over the years, even though they frequently face accusations of predatory lending practices.

Now, a new study reveals insight that might make employers reconsider how they manage this part of their business.

Bi‑weekly pay leads to chronic stress

The current pay structure has hidden consequences. Workers must manage bill due dates and budget for food, rent, phone, internet, etc., all while wondering whether their next check will cover it.

For hourly workers who don't have much savings, the cycle can create a frenzy of short-term financial triage.

The constant financial juggling can take a toll on mental health, straining relationships and reducing productivity at work — all of which is bad for employers.

In a recent Talker Research-commissioned survey, conducted May 13-21, 2025, among 2,000 U.S. hourly workers, including 1,000 who work in retail, nearly 39% reported that living paycheck to paycheck with a consistent income would be an upgrade compared to their current financial situation — and 44% had recently overdrafted their account.

""For a long time, 'living paycheck to paycheck' was considered to be the lowest tier of financial wellness,"" a Talker Research spokesperson told TheStreet. ""In this tier, people aren't able to put their money into savings or level up financially because all their money is going toward immediate needs like rent and groceries. But now, the data shows that many aren't even able to live paycheck to paycheck, slipping into an even lower tier of financial wellness.""

The survey also found:

38% of hourly workers have less than $1,000 in savings.

19% of hourly workers took out loans in the past year to get through the pay cycle.

34% of hourly workers rely on two or more jobs to stay afloat.

Many resort to extreme measures — selling personal property or even dumpster diving — to survive, according to the survey.

This data suggests that current pay structures are both inconvenient and insufficient.

On‑demand pay is a preference for many, not just a perk

The solution may lie in on-demand pay, also known as “earned wage access” (EWA), where workers can access a portion of their earned wages before designated paydays.

Of course, there are dozens of companies competing for employers’ attention in this sector. DailyPay, Payactiv, Earnin, Branch, ZayZoon, and Wagestream are just a few of the EWA companies that have popped up in the last few years.

The survey found that 78% of workers believe having this option would stabilize their finances.

Among those already receiving on-demand wages, results are promising, per Talker Research:

22% of hourly workers used their wages for groceries and essentials;

20% of hourly workers avoided late or missed bill payments; and

15% of hourly workers reported lower financial stress.

These sorts of changes could also benefit employers. Since financial stress correlates with mental strain, absenteeism, and lower productivity, employers who rethink paydays could be rewarded with a stronger workforce.

While we wait for official numbers to come out for Q2 which just closed last Monday, June 30, the year was off to a stellar start when Q1 buybacks hit a record of $293B, according to S&P Global. The previous record was set in Q1 2022 when buybacks totaled $281B.[1] Analysts have said they expect 2025 to hit $1T in total buybacks.[2]

Buybacks remained top heavy, with the top 20 S&P 500 companies accounting for 48.4% of Q1 2025 buybacks, a slight decrease from 49% in Q4 2024. While the concentration amongst top stock repurchases still exists, more companies within the S&P 500 have been repurchasing stock as of late, and the number purchasing over 1% of their public stock has increased.[3] This story changes slightly when you look globally.

Total Number of Global Companies Announcing Buybacks is Lower

Despite the dollar level of buybacks hitting records, Wall Street Horizon data shows that the actual number of announcements has been relatively low, historically speaking. The second quarter closed out with 164 announcements, that comes after Q1 recorded 168 buyback announcements. The quarterly average over the last five years has been 204 announcements. You can see in the chart below that those numbers are steadily climbing after bottom-ing out in 2023.

An Age-Old Debate: Are Buybacks Good or Bad?

As interest rates fall, as many are expecting at the next Fed meeting on July 30, holding onto cash tends to become less attractive to corporations who want to deploy and put it to work. Typically, buybacks are a good thing for shareholders as well, as they artificially improve earnings per share of a company, if not actually improving earnings. Share repurchases come under fire for this reason as well, with many arguing that companies could have put the money to better use by investing it back into the company. Investors tend to prefer companies that are buying back shares while also investing in growth. A great example is the mega tech names, many of which are the largest buyers of their own stock, but also tend to invest heavily in research and development and AI, among other things.

The Bottom-Line

As the Q2 earnings season begins on Tuesday, July 15th with reports from major banks, investors should closely monitor buyback announcements. An increase in share repurchases would indicate corporate America's renewed willingness to deploy cash, which could have positive implications for the US economy.

For Albertsons Media Collective, the chain’s media arm, the physical store at Cannes, stocked with products ready to be sold, represented the ultimate goal: getting products off the shelves and into customers’ hands.

According to Evan Hovorka, VP, product and innovation, Albertsons Media Collective, their presence in Cannes “really reflects our DNA,” adding, “We exist to provide shoppers with cost-effective food solutions.” Hovorka said that bringing this mission to Cannes completes the circle, encompassing media, merchandising, and product sales.

In-store media network

Also at the festival, Albertsons Media Collective launched an in-store digital display network to provide brands and agencies “a more robust way for them to tell their story directly to our shoppers at the most important point of their decision-making process,” Hovorka said.

The network allows them to present creative media-driven narratives featuring recipes, sustainability programs, or new product launches.

The timing is crucial, said Hovorka. Customers are already in the store and ready to spend, making it an ideal moment to connect brands with shoppers. “There couldn’t be a more beautiful way to connect a brand to the shopper,” Hovorka said.

According to eMarketer, in-store retail media ad spending is projected to exceed $500 million in 2025, which supports the emphasis on connecting with shoppers at the point of sale.

Video ads complete the picture

Hovorka noted that the network features high-resolution video ad units distributed across stores, which he sees as an improvement over static images found in other retailers. While shelf tags and screen prints remain important components of a retail media network, “now we’ve got the most exciting missing piece, which is that inspirational video,” Hovorka said.

Hovorka offered an example of influencers showcasing a new guacamole recipe leading into Cinco de Mayo, displayed above avocados on sale, adding that it “really is the icing on the cake to complete our full omni-channel journey.”

Albertsons Media Collective launched “Collective TV” in June 2024, integrating retail media with television advertising, which aligns with the strategy of using video to create richer storytelling.

The pilot program launches across 80 stores, with plans to scale to 2,300 stores. “This is an opportunity for brands and agencies to invest early, help us shape this narrative and shape this product into something that’s going to work best for everybody involved,” Hovorka said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/97784-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 14:03:45.490413

He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.” Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund.

When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.","SINGAPORE: McDonald’s Singapore has issued an apology after a customer complained about an unusually long wait time and an unpleasant exchange with a manager at its Hougang 1 outlet.

Mr Tay, who shared his experience with citizen journalism platform Stomp, said he had placed a takeaway order at the restaurant at 10.28pm on June 7. Despite initially waiting patiently, he only received his food at 11.16pm—48 minutes later.

According to Mr Tay, the store was busy when he arrived, so he did not mind waiting at first. However, by 10.55pm, he noticed that other customers who had ordered around the same time were already leaving.

“I asked an auntie at the counter about it. She told me to wait for my order as it was still being prepared,” Mr Tay told Stomp, “After 10 minutes, I asked her again. She told me to wait.”

When his order was eventually ready close to 11.16pm, Mr Tay requested to speak to the duty manager to understand the delay. What followed, he said, was an unpleasant encounter.

“The auntie told him about it, but he turned his head, ignored me and carried on doing his things,” Mr Tay wrote in his feedback to McDonald’s, “After that, the auntie called him again, and he unwillingly came to the counter.”

Mr Tay alleged that the manager’s demeanour quickly turned confrontational when he asked why the food had taken so long.

“He immediately started with a rude attitude, opening his eyes wide and talking like a gangster,” Mr Tay claimed, “He challenged me and asked why I couldn’t see that the store was busy—are the kitchen staff dancing? He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.”

Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund. He also expressed shock when the manager suggested he was being disrespectful.

“I asked him why he was so rude. He told me that I did not give him ‘face’ in front of other customers and staff. I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.

When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.

“He threw his name tag on the desk. When I wanted to take a picture of it, he timidly snatched it back and asked me to take a photo of the ‘shift manager on duty’,” Mr Tay recounted, “It was definitely a forgotten order and the manager was not apologetic at all.”

In his feedback, Mr Tay described the manager’s behaviour as “frightening” and said the entire episode left him “a very disappointed customer”.

McDonald’s Singapore has since apologised over the episode. A spokesperson told Stomp, “We’re sorry to hear about what happened and have since reached out to make things right. Consistent service matters to us, and we’ve taken steps—including reinforcing training with our team—to help prevent this from happening again.”

Mr Tay later confirmed that McDonald’s had contacted him, apologised, and refunded the cost of the meal. Reflecting on the outcome, he said: “Social media power is very fantastic.”",https://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-13-021013.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:05:57.112999

The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half.

It all kicks off on Tuesday with America's banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street.

But U.S. President Donald Trump's policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs.

The investment bank's economists see ""conflicting messages on the margin outlook"" as companies have only announced modest price increases, despite the cost hikes associated with higher tariffs.

Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, ""the consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year — down from 12% in the first quarter.""

With the banks set to dominate next week — JPMorgan , Citi , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days — maybe Europe can provide some optimism.

As reported by CNBC's Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997. Gains were driven by strong investment banking returns — something their U.S. counterparts are also likely to capitalize on — as well as stock rallies based on both deal speculation and actual M&A.

As someone who grew up in Cape Town, seeing this year's G20 meetings take place in South Africa makes me pine for the sunshine of the Southern hemisphere.

Next week's meeting in Durban between finance ministers and central bank governors comes at an interesting time for the country.

An Oval Office meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump went spectacularly wrong back in May, when the latter, flanked by his South African (now former) right-hand man Elon Musk, made false claims of a ""white genocide.""

It seems tensions have not abated.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will skip the meeting altogether, opting to head to Japan instead, according to Reuters. South Africa is also subject to a new 30% tariff rate, the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to be singled out in the latest round of announcements.

It does not bode well for the G20 Leaders meeting, due to be held in Gauteng on Nov. 22-23. It remains to be seen if Trump will attend.

To combat slowing sales, Starbucks hired former Chipotle executive Brian Niccol as its chair and CEO in August. Niccol addressed the situation directly at the time, saying, “It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers.""

Niccol named the company's new ""Back to Starbucks"" plan as the key to that change, saying, ""My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back.""

Part of the company's plan is to attract consumers back to Starbucks as a community gathering space, moving away from the quick-speed tweaks it implemented in prior years.

Since announcing the plan, Starbucks has made a variety of other changes, including writing on cups again, bringing back the condiment bar, ditching the non-dairy upcharge, and adding additional coverage hours in 3,000 of its locations.

In addition to all those tweaks, it's also got a new drink coming to weather the hottest part of summer.

Starbucks has a new take on cold brew

Since it's the hottest time of the year, Starbucks has decided it's time to deliver something exciting with a tasty new spin on a coffee classic: the cold brew.

As we reported previously, Starbucks is bringing back a raspberry syrup it originally discontinued in 2023.

“Starbucks will also be bringing back raspberry syrup for a very limited time this July to delight fans, and the company plans to bring more flavor drops in the future,” the company said in a June 10 news release.

However, Starbucks also has a new drink coming, which it hasn't yet revealed: a Raspberry Cream cold brew, as reporter by food blogger Markie Devo via his X account on July 10.

Devo says that several employees have told him the new drink is coming, which is the chain's signature coffee sweetened with vanilla syrup and topped with a raspberry cream cold foam.

Devo originally reported that the drink could come out on July 24 for rewards members and July 29 nationwide, but it looks like those dates have been changed just a bit, as now the new drink drops for a limited time on July 28.

Starbucks employees sound off on the changes

While Niccol promises the Back to Starbucks program will transform the brand, there's one group of people who don't love the changes: the baristas.

The Starbucks subreddit features a fair number of complaints about the new policies, with one focused heavily on the return to writing on cups.

""WRITING ON CUPS IS STUPID. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY. It slows us down, no one likes doing it, being coached for not doing it is ridiculous, the customers don’t f**king care,"" wrote one user, who also claimed the practice was unsanitary.

Another user called out the menu simplification, calling Niccol's ordered changes ""laughable.""

""Sure, he took away some pastries (but added some),"" the user wrote. ""Took away creme based frappuccinos which are still being ordered, which are now simply harder and more time consuming to ring up (which makes it more difficult to meet their strict ""peak"" time crunches). Oh, and thanks for the hellish frappuccinos the week of July 4. Really. Foam?""",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDgyNzIwODg0NDM0Nzgx/a-barista-places-an-iced-coffee-in-the-mobile-pickup-area-at-a-starbucks-in-new-york-3.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:11:21.379796

Soybean oil is being used as a sustainable replacement for petroleum and other oils in tire sidewalls.

Firestone uses racing as a testing ground for new tire technologies before implementing them in consumer tires.

NEWTON—Tires made in part with soybeans grown in Iowa will be coming soon to Firestone stores.

Firestone, IndyCar's tire manufacturer, tests tire technology by using it first in its IndyCar tires before making it more widely available in consumer tires. The company is owned by Bridgestone Americas, which employs 700 people at its Des Moines Agricultural Tire Plant. The plant also makes Firestone tires for tractors.

Cara Krstolic, Firestone race tire engineering and production executive director, said that Firestone's consumer tires — whether manufactured for cars or tractors — share some materials with its racing tires. In 2022, Firestone introduced an alternative tire made from guayule, a plant that grows in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, to use on street courses. More recently, Firestone added soybean oil to its race tires.

Soybean oil is used in sidewalls of tires, and the company is experimenting with other uses for it, Krstolic said.

""Leftover residual oil from the soybean can be used to replace petroleum,"" Krstolic said. ""And it can also work on reducing some of our other oils in the tires.""

Soybeans are also more renewable than other plants Firestone has experimented with, she said.

""The nice thing about the soybean is that there's enough sources that you can get that (and) you're not competing as food source,"" Krstolic said. ""

Among the products Firestone makes at Bridgestone's Des Moines factory are tractor tires, which sit on a tractor in Victory Lane.

Since its inception, car and tire manufacturers have used racing to test products before rolling sales out to consumers. Firestone founder Harvey Firestone coined the phrase, ""Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.""

Each race weekend Firestone brings about 20 people to mount tires and six engineers to monitor tire temperatures and other data on tires. Eventually all of this work at Iowa Speedway and IndyCar's 15 other tracks makes it into consumer tires, Krstolic said.

""Racing is a mobile lab,"" Krstolic said. ""Where else can you see the extremes of heat and durability and performance than on race tracks?... So there are materials that we'll put into this race and other races that we can prove out at speeds of 200 mph.""

Conclusion: A Resilient Outperformer U.S. Bancorp's strategic moves under Kedia position it as a resilient competitor in an evolving banking landscape.","Amid the volatility of the U.S. banking sector, U.S. Bancorp (USB) has emerged as a standout performer, leveraging strategic initiatives and a leadership transition to fortify its position. The bank's Q2 2025 earnings, to be released on July 17, will offer critical insights into its ability to navigate challenges such as declining interest rates and rising costs while maintaining peer-leading returns. Under CEO Gunjan Kedia's leadership, the bank is executing a multi-pronged strategy to enhance profitability, expand digitally, and capitalize on partnerships—all hallmarks of a resilient outperformer.

Leadership Transition Fuels Strategic Focus

Kedia's April 2025 appointment as CEO marked a pivotal shift. A veteran of the bank's corporate and investment divisions, she has prioritized operational discipline and growth through technology and partnerships. Alongside CFO John Stern, she has outlined ambitious targets: boosting the net interest margin (NIM) to over 3% from 2.72% in Q1 2025 and cutting costs via four new initiatives. These moves align with her vision to balance risk management with aggressive pursuit of revenue synergies from the Union Bank acquisition. Analysts note her potential to accelerate digital transformation, a critical edge in an industry increasingly defined by fintech disruption.

Strategic Initiatives: Efficiency and Digital Growth

U.S. Bancorp's Q2 focus hinges on two pillars: optimizing its existing customer base and leveraging partnerships to drive capital-light growth. The bank's Q1 ROTCE of 17.5%—up from 16.5% in Q1 2024—demonstrates operational leverage, but sustaining this will require execution on cost-saving measures and NIM expansion.

The partnership with Fiserv, announced in June, is a case in point. Integrating U.S. Bank's Elan credit card program into Fiserv's Credit Choice platform creates a seamless digital experience for consumers and small businesses. This collaboration, set to fully convert by year-end, reduces operational friction and expands U.S. Bancorp's reach without physical branch investments. Similarly, its long-running partnership with State Farm—now offering co-branded credit cards and loans—has generated 120,000 accounts in 2023 alone, showcasing the power of third-party networks to scale efficiently.

Navigating Challenges: Cost Discipline and Interest Rate Headwinds

The bank faces headwinds, including gradual interest rate cuts and rising expenses. U.S. Bancorp's Q1 noninterest expense rose 3.5% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, a trend it aims to reverse through cost-saving measures. The goal is an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s by 2026-2027, down from 60.8% in Q1 2025.

On NIM, the bank is countering rate pressures through loan growth (up 0.9% Q/Q to $381.8 billion) and deposit optimization. Its strategy to reduce reliance on high-cost deposits and favor loan growth—particularly in commercial and corporate segments—should help achieve the 3% NIM target. However, the Federal Reserve's potential cuts later this year could test this approach.

Valuation and Investment Considerations

At current levels, U.S. Bancorp's stock trades at 1.6x tangible book value, below its five-year average of 1.8x, suggesting undervaluation relative to peers. Its dividend yield of 2.8%—supported by a strong capital position (Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.8% in Q1)—offers stability.

Investors should monitor Q2 results for progress on:

1. NIM expansion and cost-saving execution.

2. Noninterest income growth (targeted at 5% annually).

3. Loan growth trends and credit quality metrics.

Risks include prolonged rate cuts, which could pressure NII, and execution delays in digital partnerships. Yet, the bank's fortress balance sheet (nonperforming assets at 0.45% in Q1) and ethical reputation—ranked among the 2025 World's Most Ethical Companies—provide a safety net.

Conclusion: A Resilient Outperformer

U.S. Bancorp's strategic moves under Kedia position it as a resilient competitor in an evolving banking landscape. Its focus on digital innovation, cost discipline, and partnerships reduces reliance on traditional branch expansion, while its financial metrics—ROTEC and efficiency ratio—signal operational strength. While challenges remain, the bank's execution could validate its undervalued stock, making it a compelling pick for investors seeking stability in a volatile sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:02:58.975268

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future.","The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by rising theft, evolving consumer expectations, and the relentless march of e-commerce. At the epicenter of this transformation stands Walmart, whose bold moves to combat theft and dominate online grocery sales offer a blueprint for retailers navigating today's challenges. By integrating physical and digital strategies while addressing loss prevention, Walmart is redefining the rules of the game—and investors would be wise to take note.

The Anti-Theft Tightrope: Balancing Security and Trust

Walmart's recent anti-theft initiatives—locking meats in tamper-resistant cages, deploying AI-driven checkout systems, and embedding hidden barcodes—aim to stem losses that cost U.S. retailers $61 billion annually. These measures have sparked public outcry, with critics calling Walmart's “imprisoned” food displays a betrayal of its value-driven ethos. TikTok users and consumer advocacy groups have amplified concerns, citing a 16.5% rise in discrimination complaints linked to intrusive security practices.

Yet, Walmart's actions are strategic. Theft at self-checkouts has surged by 30% since 2020, and the company cannot afford to cede ground to competitors or erode margins further. The operational costs of these changes—new technologies, staff training, and potential declines in customer convenience—are substantial. However, Walmart's scale and infrastructure (e.g., 4,700 U.S. stores) allow it to absorb these expenses while maintaining its dominance.

The E-Commerce Edge: Walmart's 31.6% Market Share Lead

Walmart's true advantage lies in its omnichannel strategy. With 31.6% of the U.S. online grocery market—$63.79 billion in projected 2025 sales—the company outpaces Amazon (22.6%) and Instacart (21.6%) by prioritizing value, convenience, and integration. Its Walmart+ membership program, which offers free delivery and cash-back incentives, has driven a 21% year-over-year global e-commerce sales growth. Meanwhile, delivery costs per order have dropped nearly 40%, thanks to AI-optimized logistics and store-fulfilled orders.

The data underscores Walmart's resilience:

While Amazon's Prime ecosystem and Instacart's delivery network remain formidable, Walmart's physical-digital hybrid model—where 72.2% of its online sales flow directly through its own platform—gives it an edge in controlling pricing, inventory, and customer experience. Shoppers, particularly cost-conscious families, reward this integration: Walmart's average order value exceeds competitors' by 20%.

Competitive Dynamics: Why Walmart's Playbook Works

Amazon and Instacart face structural limitations. Amazon's grocery sales, though growing, rely heavily on one-off purchases (e.g., toiletries), whereas Walmart dominates full-basket shopping. Instacart, while the top delivery intermediary (57.7% of U.S. delivery sales), struggles as retailers like Walmart and Kroger build in-house logistics to reduce reliance on third parties.

Walmart's strategy also addresses a key consumer shift: the demand for seamless omnichannel experiences. Its 2025 delivery share rose nearly 8 percentage points year-over-year, and its pickup services remain preferred by 45.5% of shoppers. By leveraging generative AI for dynamic pricing and personalized recommendations, Walmart is not just keeping pace but setting the pace.

Investment Implications: Betting on Loss Prevention and Omnichannel Mastery

Walmart's moves signal a broader industry trend: retailers must prioritize loss prevention and omnichannel integration to thrive. Investors should favor companies that:

1. Control the end-to-end customer journey (e.g., Walmart's integrated stores and apps).

2. Invest in AI and automation to reduce costs and enhance customer experience.

3. Maintain low prices without sacrificing margins through supply chain efficiency.

Walmart's stock, currently trading at $152.30 (as of July 2025), offers a compelling entry point. Its dividend yield of 1.2% and consistent e-commerce growth (outpacing overall revenue) make it a defensive play in a volatile market. Meanwhile, Amazon's reliance on high-margin digital services and Instacart's dependency on retailer partnerships leave them exposed to margin pressures and competition.

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail

Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future. By balancing security with convenience, leveraging scale to absorb costs, and owning the customer experience from shelf to doorstep, Walmart is proving that the winners of the retail revolution will be those who master both physical and digital worlds. For investors, this is a signal to back retailers with similar strategies: those who innovate without losing sight of their core values.

In a sector where theft, convenience, and trust are existential battlegrounds, Walmart's resilience is a harbinger of things to come. The question isn't whether the retail revolution will succeed—it's already here. The answer is who will lead it. For now, the answer is Walmart.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:09:56.415167

I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless.
Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people.
Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure.","A pair of security researchers has revealed vulnerabilities in the McHire chatbot Paradox, developed for McDonald's, that could have been exploited to reveal personal information about roughly 64 million people who have used the service to apply for jobs at their local franchises. (Hat-tip Wired.)

I was ""hacked"" the first time when I was 14. I put that in scare quotes because the password for the account was ""1234."" (Without the quotes or period, of course, which makes it even worse.) After I regained access to the account, I started using a password manager.

Why is that relevant? Because the researchers who found these vulnerabilities, Ian Carroll and Sam Curry, were able to guess the password used by ""Paradox team members"" to access McHire: ""123456."" That's slightly better than the password I used, I guess, but not enough to justify its use decades after most people realized that using weak passwords is a bad idea.

There is some good news: ""It turned out we had become the administrator of a test restaurant inside the McHire system,"" Carroll and Curry wrote. ""We could see all of the employees of the restaurant were simply employees of Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire. This was great because we could now see how the app worked, but annoying because we had still not demonstrated any actual confidentiality or integrity impact.""

That's where the second vulnerability comes in. (Or the first, depending on whether or not you count the embarrassingly bad password as a true vuln.) An insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaw in the McHire API allowed Carroll and Curry to gain access to the following information from ""every chat interaction [from anyone who] ever applied for a job at McDonald’s"":

Name, email address, phone number, address

Candidacy state and every state change/form input the candidate had submitted (shifts they could work, etc)

Auth token to log into the consumer UI as that user, leaking their raw chat messages and presumably other information

Carroll and Curry noted that Paradox had previously bragged that 90% of McDonald's franchises were using McHire as part of their hiring practices. (That link still leads to the appropriate post on Paradox's blog, but the section related to McDonald's has been removed, and neither the Wayback Machine nor Google's cache has saved old versions of the post. Weird!)

So let's compare and contrast. I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless. Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people. But at least their password was two characters longer!

Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure.

Recognized as Africa’s largest airline and one of the fastest-growing global aviation brands, Ethiopian Airlines continues to embody an African success story — one that has translated a bold vision into a world-class reality over the past eight decades. The airline currently serves over 160 passenger and cargo destinations across five continents.

More than just a carrier, Ethiopian plays a strategic role in connecting Africa to the rest of the world.

Vision 2035 is rooted in a commitment to safe, secure, market-responsive, and customer-focused services across a diverse portfolio that includes passenger and cargo operations, logistics, aviation training, airport management, ground handling, aircraft maintenance (MRO), aerospace manufacturing, and travel and tourism.

CEO Mesfin stated that the airline is implementing the roadmap with an emphasis on “fast and profitable growth.” Key components of this effort include network expansion, fleet modernization, and enhanced operational efficiency.

“As part of this strategy, we’ve continued to open new routes,” he said, citing recent additions such as Sharjah (UAE), Hyderabad (India), Oporto (Portugal), and Hanoi (Vietnam). He noted that Ethiopian inaugurated its Hanoi route this Thursday, underscoring its ongoing global expansion.

Increasing the frequency of flights to existing destinations also remains a key focus, Mesfin added. He revealed that the airline is actively exploring new long-haul opportunities, including a potential launch of services to Australia. A feasibility study for that route is currently underway.

On fleet development, Mesfin confirmed that Ethiopian has placed orders for approximately 120 new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus. These include Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the next-generation 777X, along with Airbus A350s. The airline is also currently receiving deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX, with two aircraft received last month and more scheduled for arrival.

To enhance its regional capacity, the airline is evaluating options for acquiring additional 100-seat aircraft, with new orders expected to be placed soon.

Beyond fleet and route expansion, Ethiopian is also deepening its global footprint through strategic partnerships. The CEO disclosed that the airline is currently collaborating with four foreign carriers and remains open to additional joint ventures.

“Several countries have expressed interest in partnering with us to establish their own national carriers,” he told local news agency ENA. “Our approach typically begins with a feasibility study to assess the viability of such initiatives.”

In a shocking cybersecurity lapse, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring tool reportedly exposed the personal data of more than 64 million job applicants — all because it was secured with the world’s most infamous password: “123456”.

The vulnerability was discovered last month by security researchers who, out of curiosity, decided to probe the fast food giant’s recruitment chatbot after a Reddit thread highlighted how poorly it was responding to job seekers.

According to WIRED, they shared the details of the breach on Wednesday (9 July), and McDonald’s has also confirmed that they have patched the security risk.

Researcher gains access to personal data using default login credentials

Security expert Ian Carroll detailed the breach in a blog post, explaining that he was drawn to investigate McHire, McDonald’s AI recruitment system, after seeing a Reddit post about its chatbot, Olivia.

The Reddit post shared a frustrating interaction between a job applicant and the AI chatbot, with the bot giving nonsensical answers.

After just a few hours, he and fellow researcher Sam Curry stumbled upon a serious flaw — they could log in using default admin credentials, where both the username and password were simply “123456”.

This granted them full access to a database containing the private information of more than 64 million applicants, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

Breach reported, vulnerability fixed within hours

Upon discovering the flaw, the researchers immediately contacted Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire, and McDonald’s. The alert was sent on 30 June, prompting swift action.

Paradox.ai patched the vulnerability within hours, later confirming in a blog post that no unauthorised parties accessed the system, and that the only individuals who did were the two ethical researchers.

They also pledged to launch a bug bounty programme to catch such issues in future.

“We do not take this matter lightly, even though it was resolved swiftly and effectively,” they told WIRED. “We own this.”

Meanwhile, McDonald’s agreed that Paradox.ai were to blame.

“We’re disappointed by this unacceptable vulnerability from a third-party provider, Paradox.ai. As soon as we learned of the issue, we mandated Paradox.ai to remediate the issue immediately, and it was resolved on the same day it was reported to us,” the fast food chain said.

This week, Wall Street is gearing up for the second-quarter earnings season, with major banks and household names like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, and Netflix set to report their financials. Amidst the earnings releases, trade developments, including President Donald Trump's tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, will continue to draw significant attention from investors and financial professionals. The economic calendar is also busy, with inflation and retail sales reports scheduled for release.

Second-Quarter Earnings Season

The earnings season is expected to kick off with a bang, as major U.S. corporations, including banks and pharmaceutical companies, are set to release their financial results. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, among other major banks, will report their earnings, providing insights into the financial health of the banking sector. Johnson & Johnson, a leading pharmaceutical company, is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share, indicating a decline of 5.7% compared to the year-ago period [3]. Analysts forecast revenues of $22.79 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% year over year.

Trade Developments

The ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump will continue to be a focal point for investors. The U.S. has implemented tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and impact corporate earnings. The impact of these tariffs will be closely watched by investors and financial analysts, as they could influence the performance of companies and sectors that are heavily exposed to international trade.

Economic Calendar

The economic calendar is packed with important releases this week. On Tuesday, July 15, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released, which could provide clues about the future of interest rates. The CPI is expected to show a monthly rise of 0.23% and a year-over-year increase of 2.6% [2]. Additionally, retail sales data will be released on Wednesday, July 16, which will give insights into consumer spending habits.

Conclusion

This week promises to be a busy one for Wall Street, with second-quarter earnings season in full swing and a packed economic calendar. Investors and financial professionals will be closely monitoring the earnings reports and economic data releases to gauge the health of the economy and make informed investment decisions.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate.
Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate.
EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S.
“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.","The U.S. will implement 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective Aug. 1, according to letters President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday morning.

The announcements come amid a rush of country-specific duty proclamations from Trump, covering many of the country's top trading partners, including Canada, Brazil, Japan and South Korea. All tariffs are slated to start Aug. 1.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate. He also called attention to security topics, like cartel activity within Mexico and its link to U.S. fentanyl trafficking within the letter.

Since early March, imports from Mexico, like those from Canada, have been subject to a 25% tariff unless they qualify for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement treatment.

The Saturday letter to Mexico does not clarify whether the USMCA exemption will continue under the new tariff rate, nor whether the 35% duty will replace the original 25% levy.

Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate. To that end, officials from Mexico met with U.S. counterparts on Friday to establish a permanent working group that would allow the countries to consistently discuss key issues, including flashpoints like security, migration, water management and the economy, according to a press release Saturday.

During that meeting, the U.S. informed Mexico it would send a letter setting new tariffs on Aug. 1, according to the press release, which was issued jointly by Mexico's economy and foreign affairs ministries. Mexico's officials called the action unfair and said they did not agree, but established that one of the working group's first goals would be to seek an alternative prior to the implementation date, according to the release.

“It is highly relevant to have established, since July 11, the necessary channels and space to resolve any possibility of new tariffs going into effect on August 1,” the release says in Spanish. “In other words, Mexico is already in negotiations.”

Trump’s missive to EU President Ursula von der Leyen is also mostly identical to other versions he has shared this week but features a line not included in any previously posted version.

“The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit,” the letter says. It is unclear if this is a provision to which the EU has agreed or a request from the president.

EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S. The bloc is one of many U.S. trading partners attempting to navigate Trump's tariff-heavy trade policy and negotiate with the White House for reduced duties.

“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic. We will continue working towards an agreement by August 1,” von der Leyen said in a post on X Saturday. “At the same time, we are ready to safeguard EU interests on the basis of proportionate countermeasures.”

In May, Trump said talks with the EU ""are going nowhere"" and recommended a 50% tariff on imports from the bloc starting July 9. The president has also threatened tariffs on specific EU-origin products — including wine and champagne — and levied duties targeting major sectors like steel, aluminum and the automotive industry.

Since February, the barrage of U.S.-imposed tariffs have impacted 70% of total EU trade with the U.S., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech Tuesday.

""The scale and the scope of these measures is unprecedented,"" von der Leyen said. ""Our line has been clear. We will be firm. We do prefer a negotiated solution. This is why we are working closely with the US administration to get an agreement.""

The EU has been preparing its own countermeasures if ongoing tariff negotiations fall short of the bloc's goals. The retaliatory actions would impact more than $100 billion worth of imports and apply to a range of industrial and agricultural products.

Wednesday, July 16:

1. Bank of America: The bank is expected to report on its net interest income (NII) and revenue. Bank of America's NII was $13.7 billion in the second quarter, with optimistic guidance for the latter half of 2024 [2].

2. Goldman Sachs: The investment bank reported a 150% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profits, driven by strong performance in its global banking & markets and asset & wealth management divisions [2].

Market Implications:

The upcoming earnings reports will provide valuable information on the financial health of these companies.

Additionally, the NII and revenue reports from Bank of America will offer insights into the bank's consumer banking business. The strong performance of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley indicates a rebound in investment banking activity, which could have broader implications for the financial sector.

Investors should closely monitor these reports and analyze the companies' performance relative to their peers and market expectations. The earnings reports will likely influence market sentiment and could lead to significant price movements in the stocks of these companies.

The US is the EU's second-largest export market for steel, while Mexico leads exports of automotive products to the US.

In the letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said Mexico ""still has not stopped the cartels,"" and as a result, the US will start levying the tariffs. However, he added there will be no tariffs on Mexico if it builds or manufactures products in the US.

Similarly, Trump in his letter to EU President Ursula von der Leyen said the US had decided to end its trade deficit with the bloc and would go ahead with the tariffs, unless the EU decides to build or manufacture products in the US.

It was not clear if the current tariffs on Mexico would conflict with exemptions on trade of goods signed under the USMCA trade agreement.

Both letters mentioned that these tariffs are separate from the ""sectoral tariffs"" and any ""good transhipped to evade this higher tariff will be subjected to that higher tariff.""

In the week starting July 7, Trump sent letters to several countries imposing a varied range of tariffs on its key trade partners, including Canada, another key supplier of commodities such as steel, natural gas, and beef.

Metals sector uncertainty

From a metals perspective, the change in tariffs brings uncertainty to steel, aluminum and copper markets, as the US already has a separate 50% tariff on each of these commodities, considered critical for the economy and energy transition.

The 50% tariffs on steel imports and reciprocal tariff threats have led the US construction industry to postpone projects due to uncertainty about prices.

Since the start of 2025, Platts-assessed TSI US HRC EXW Indiana reached a year-to-date high of $950/st on March 12, the day when Trump announced the first round of tariffs. However, prices since those highs have fallen 8.4%, reaching $870/st July 11. Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The EU exported about 17% of its exportable finished steel products to the US in 2024, according to Comex data.

EU steel product exports remained steady in 2024 year over year, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea data.

From an agricultural perspective, markets in Mexico will be watching for the next developments as the country is a key importer of US corn, pork, chicken and beef.

Mexico also supplies crude oil to the US, while the US is a major supplier of refined products to Mexico.

The US runs its highest trade deficit with Mexico, according to the US Census Bureau.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-13 12:11:08.545014

There are exciting times ahead as we navigate through 2025. Australia’s hotel sector, whilst choppy, continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience with national occupancy rates at 71% and RevPAR up 3.8% to $171. Despite ongoing challenges, this growth creates a landscape ripe with both hurdles and opportunities.

Sydney leads the recovery charge with occupancy at 78% and RevPAR growing to an impressive $215, making this market our standout performer. Conversely, Melbourne and Hobart continue to face headwinds from supply increases and slightly softening domestic leisure demand.

In New Zealand, we see a similar dichotomy—Queenstown, Christchurch, and Rotorua benefit from returning international visitors. Auckland is grappling with increased room inventory, and Wellington is adjusting to reduced government spending.

Third-party management, stakeholder experiences, and technology integration are key trends reshaping our industry. Eco-certified properties are no longer niche but necessary, with major operators prioritising this. The premium/luxury segments continue to expand, particularly with branded residences attracting both domestic and international guests.

The premium and experiential hotel segments present compelling opportunities. Properties offering immersive experiences command premium rates as travellers increasingly value authenticity over standardisation. We’re also seeing strong performance in market mix diversity, where segments combine to offset the ups and downs of current economic and global conditions.

After subdued transaction activity in 2024 ($1.25 billion in transactions to October), we anticipate increased momentum in 2025 as interest rates plateau. While construction costs have tempered new developments, this has heightened the value of existing assets, particularly in supply-constrained markets. In addition, developers are also sourcing creative ways to deliver economically viable hotel projects.

Introducing 60 new international flight routes enhances Australia’s connectivity to key Asian markets, North America, and Europe, further strengthening investment fundamentals for strategically positioned assets.

For Trilogy Hotels, we are excited and optimistic about the future. We remain focused on markets demonstrating strong performance outcomes for owners while selectively exploring opportunities in emerging destinations where we can leverage these evolving consumer preferences and travel patterns.",https://www.hotelmanagement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Novotel-Sydney-Parramatta-hm.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:35.467697

The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.
Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.
While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.
This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024.","Kraft Heinz has issued a massive recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon over fears of Listeria contamination—a serious foodborne threat that can lead to hospitalization and even death.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the fully cooked turkey bacon was produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025. The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The affected items include:

12-oz. vacuum-sealed packages with UPC ""071871548601,"" dated between July 18 and August 2 with lot code “RS40”

36-oz. packages (three 12-oz. packs) with UPC “071871548748,” dated July 23 to September 4 and lot codes “RS19,” “RS40,” or “RS42”

48-oz. packages (four 12-oz. packs) with UPC ""071871548793,” dated July 18 to September 4 and lot codes ""RS19,"" ""RS40,"" or ""RS42""

No illnesses have been reported to date, but FSIS warned that the products could still be sitting in home refrigerators or freezers. Consumers are urged not to eat the recalled turkey bacon and to either throw it away or return it to the store where it was purchased.

Listeria monocytogenes, the contaminant in question, is a resilient bacteria that can grow even at refrigerated temperatures.

Infections can cause serious illness, particularly for pregnant women, newborns, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.

The contamination was discovered through routine internal testing by Kraft Heinz. While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.

This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024. It also places renewed pressure on major brands like Kraft Heinz to strengthen safety protocols and maintain public trust as consumer scrutiny over labeling and contamination risks intensifies.",https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE2MTgzMDU5NDMzNjYxODA3/kraft-heinz-reportedly-considers-sale-of-oscar-mayer.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:40.442236

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.
But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves.","Venture capitalist Harry Stebbings faced a wave of backlash in June after urging European startup founders to increase their work hours — but he now admits there's some room for nuance when applying his mantra.

Stebbings, founder of 20VC, a firm managing $650 million in funds, advised founders on LinkedIn last month that ""7 days a week is the required velocity to win right now,"" to compete with startups in Silicon Valley and China.

The post went viral, to Stebbings' surprise, and sparked a debate on whether China's brutal ""996"" work culture — which means working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — is needed in Europe.

The conversation is rooted in a persistent stereotype that Europe's tech and startup scene is lagging behind the U.S. and China, which have produced trillion-dollar tech giants and are known for implementing long working hours.

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple. China meanwhile houses giants like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.

""If you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them [Silicon Valley and China], you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.

""What Europe really needs isn't more hustle-porn, it's more aggressive funding,"" Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, said back then.

Speaking to CNBC Make It about the fallout, Stebbings said that he wasn't prepared for the criticism he received, and that his original post didn't apply to the vast majority of people who responded.

""I think it's everything that's wrong with Europe, that backlash,"" Stebbings said. ""We are fighting against companies being built in Silicon Valley, and speed and the ability to move fast, really determines success, in AI especially.""

He added: ""When you go to the Valley now, and when you go to China now, they are working seven days a week in the fastest-growing companies. It's that simple. So, if you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them, you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

'We should be working harder than ever'

As companies build more important products, Stebbings said the bar is higher than it used to be.

""We should be working harder than ever because we're working to solve more important problems than ever,"" he said.

But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage. Atomico's State of European Tech report of 2024 showed that, since 2015, Europe's tech startups have missed out on nearly $375 billion in growth-stage funding, with founders losing out on a potential $300 billion in European investments.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves. ""If a team of 10 is burning out to keep up with a 50-person U.S. VC or Chinese government-backed startup, the problem isn't their stamina, it's their cap table.""

However, Stebbings pinned this down to poor marketing and said Europeans aren't great fundraisers compared to their American counterparts. ""I don't think it's a lack of access to cash at all, and in terms of the work ethic there, if you think that you can build a $10 billion business and work five days a week, then I'm sorry to say, you're deluding yourself.""

Some founders have even been ""badly"" advised to include exit slides in their pitches, he added. ""That makes me feel sick, like I'm planning my divorce when I get married.""

In stark contrast, Americans are much better at telling exciting stories when they promote their businesses. ""I think, often in the U.K., we downsize in ambitions.""

996 is 'ignorant'

Ultimately, Stebbings admitted that he jokes with the ""marketing facade"" of 996, but that it's a more nuanced picture than working all the time.

""I think that's [996] very ignorant to do,"" he said. ""if you don't allow people breaks in there and a gym workout, it's just moronic.""

Stebbings said that 100% dedication is essential in the first five years — but that doesn't mean abandoning health, wellness, and family.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day, and I'm some horrible person, absolutely not. It's really important to turn off and have a couple of hours away from your computer and just be with friends.""

Stebbings himself tries to spend as much time as possible with his sickly mother, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), including walking a marathon with her every Sunday. He jumps straight back to work after.

But it's unrealistic to expect employees to adopt the same attitude, he acknowledged.

""One of the hardest things about running a company is you will never find someone who cares about it as much as you do, the founder… I think it's unreasonable to ever expect that they will work as hard as you.""

Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, previously told CNBC Make It in June that the focus on hustle culture in the tech industry is about ""a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth.""

He said: ""California is very good at telling stories, and there's a lot of mythmaking around the concept of what startups look like.""

Stebbings now agrees with this view and said hustle culture is ""over-glamorized"" in the States.

""If you go into a WeWork in San Francisco at 7 p.m., they're not all working like we see on social media... they overly pronounce it when it's not really true, but for the 0.01% in the Valley, it's so true, and they are there and working harder than ever.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108166954-1751461509661-2024_10_02HARRYSTEBBINGS7781_4.png?v=1751899126&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:59.567023

Senior lenders to Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC), led by ReStore Capital LLC, have filed a motion in Ontario Superior Court seeking to terminate a deal to sell up to 28 store leases to B.C. billionaire Weihong (Ruby) Liu. They argue the deal is unlikely to succeed due to landlord opposition and is wasting cash that should repay creditors.

The 10-person study, where patients were observed inpatient for four days and for a week after device removal, met safety and performance endpoints.

CEO Paul Goode said in an interview that the goal of the study was to show that the device and the procedure to implant it were safe.

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. For accuracy, the results showed a mean absolute relative difference of 7.7%, which would make the device competitive with CGMs on the market, although Goode cautioned that the data is very early and the results were not statistically significant. MARD is a measurement that compares blood glucose readings from a CGM to reference measurements, such as blood glucose from a fingerstick.

Glucotrack is taking an implantable device approach to address some of the challenges that people experience with wearable CGMs, Goode said, such as the lag time in readings when blood glucose changes quickly and irritation from adhesives.

“If you look at CGMs, they're wonderful products. Many of us in the company have worked on one or more of those generations of products, and they've done a lot of good for patients with diabetes,” said Goode, who has worked for Dexcom and MiniMed, the diabetes tech business that was later acquired by Medtronic. “That being said, there are still common problems.”

Most continuous glucose monitors on the market today are worn on the skin and measure the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid surrounding cells, which is then used to calculate blood glucose values. Glucotrack’s device is different in that it is implanted in the subclavian vein near the collarbone and measures glucose values directly from the blood. Goode said the approach to implantation is similar to a minimally invasive procedure for placing a pacemaker — the CGM is placed two inches into the vein instead of into the heart.

Glucotrack intends for its sensor to last for three years, although it will still need to prove that out in a study.

Senseonics, which currently has the only implantable CGM on the U.S. market, received Food and Drug Administration clearance last year for the device to be worn for a year. Goode said the development is good for patients, adding that he expects Glucotrack’s implant to last longer because of differences in the devices’ placement and chemistry.

Senseonics’ device sits in the upper arm, in the subcutaneous space, “which is the most difficult environment to get something to work,” Goode said, while Glucotrack’s device sits in the bloodstream.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/V_wQW40bpYCa9RLw584LKY1pLw67ElJcAVnaUG1sD1U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HbHVjb3RyYWNrX2ltcGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:53.431193

Creditcorp Expands Inventory Finance to Informal Workers

Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia

In a bid to avail the informal sector operators of its services, the Nigerian Consumer Credit Corporation(CREDICORP) has entered into partnership with Sytiamo Technologies to provide affordable credit to 10,000 market women across Nigeria.

The beneficiaries would be spread across 224 markets selected in 28 states with Ariaria International Market, Aba as the starting point.

At the inauguration of the initiative at Aba, the Managing Director of CREDICORP, Mr. Uzoma Nwagba said that it was aimed at expanding financial access to informal sector workers, especially women, who are major drivers of local economies.

“Supporting women with credit is not just a social good; it’s good business,” he said.

Represented by the Executive Director, Credit and Portfolio Management, Mrs Aisha Abdullahi, Nwagba stated that the affordable loans would boost the quality of life and financial inclusion.

He explained the preponderance or women beneficiaries, saying that “women are proven to be better custodians of credit, with higher repayment rates than men”.

“With 66.7% of our executive team and 50% of our management being women, this partnership aligns with our belief that empowering women leads to stronger, more sustainable communities,” he added.

The Managing Director of Sytiamo Technologies, Mr. Michael Ogbaa, explained the rationale for the partnership with CREDICORP, saying that it is the vehicle for delivering affordable credits to market women.

“Through the partnership, we are giving market women quick access to the capital they need to scale up their businesses and improve their livelihoods,” he said.",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/AXAMansard.png,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:20.653324

As tariffs on imports from China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh soar—reaching 69.1%, 20-40%, and 35% respectively—retailers are scrambling to adapt. For companies like Nike (NKE), Ralph Lauren (RL), and Tapestry (TPR), the challenge is twofold: mitigate costs amid spiraling tariffs and preserve margins while competing in a price-sensitive market. This article dissects how these firms are faring, why geographic diversification and pricing power matter, and which stocks investors should prioritize.

The Tariff Tsunami: A Sector Under Siege

The Trump-era tariff regime has reshaped the apparel landscape. China's apparel exports to the U.S. fell 52% year-over-year in May 看不出. Vietnam's tariffs, initially set at 46%, were reduced to 20% after negotiations, while Bangladesh's 35% rate now sits atop existing baseline duties. These shifts have forced retailers to rethink sourcing, production, and pricing.

The stakes are high: U.S. apparel imports from China hit a historic low of 9.9% of market share in 2025, while Vietnam and Bangladesh's roles expanded—but not without costs. For companies reliant on Asian manufacturing, the path to resilience hinges on two pillars: geographic diversification and premium pricing power.

Nike: Pioneering Diversification, Testing Margin Limits

Exposure:

Nike sources 50% of footwear and 28% of apparel from Vietnam, with 18% footwear and 16% apparel from China. The company's $1 billion annual tariff bill underscores the urgency to shift production.

Strategy:

- Supply Chain Shifts: Nike aims to reduce Chinese footwear imports to the “high single-digit range” by 2026, while expanding into Indonesia and Cambodia. It's also exploring Africa, Central America, and Eastern Europe to avoid overconcentration in Southeast Asia.

- Pricing Power:

- Raised U.S. prices, particularly on premium products like Air Jordan sneakers (up to $10 increases).

- Focused on high-margin performance footwear (running, training) over less profitable classics like the Air Force 1.

Risk:

Despite these moves, tariffs outpace mitigation efforts, squeezing margins. Vietnam's labor strikes and infrastructure bottlenecks—echoes of pandemic-era disruptions—add volatility.

Ralph Lauren: The Agile Luxury Play

Exposure:

Ralph Lauren sources 19% of goods from Vietnam and 15% from China, with production spread across five continents. No single region exceeds 20% of its supply chain.

Strategy:

- Geographic Flexibility: Collaborates with global suppliers to reallocate production to low-cost regions while maintaining quality. Expanded facilities in Cambodia and Vietnam reduce China dependency.

- Pricing & Technology:

- Targets less price-sensitive customers, enabling selective price hikes and discount reductions.

- Leverages AI for inventory optimization, reducing waste and aligning production with demand.

Edge:

Ralph Lauren's diversification and tech-driven agility make it a standout. CFO Justin Picicci's emphasis on “real-time supply chain adjustments” positions the firm to weather tariff shocks better than peers.

Tapestry: Quiet Strength in Margin Expansion

Exposure:

70% of Tapestry's production comes from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The company has exited China but faces lingering tariff pressures on Asian imports.

Strategy:

- Operational Efficiency:

- Achieved a 280 basis point gross margin expansion in Q2 2025 via operational outperformance (+260 bps) and lower freight costs (+20 bps).

- The Coach brand's premium focus (e.g., higher Average Unit Retail for handbags) drives profitability.

- Tariff Mitigation:

- Anticipated a 10% China tariff as “immaterial,” suggesting supply chain adjustments (e.g., shifting production to tariff-friendly regions) and cost controls neutralize impacts.

Wild Card:

While Tapestry's financials are strong, its reliance on Southeast Asia mirrors Nike's risks. However, its luxury tilt (Coach, Kate Spade) grants pricing flexibility absent in mass-market peers.

Investment Thesis: Overweight Premium, Diversified Players

The tariff landscape favors firms with two traits:

1. Geographic Flexibility: Diversification beyond Vietnam and China (e.g., Nike's forays into Indonesia and Ralph Lauren's global supplier network) reduces overexposure.

2. Pricing Power: Luxury brands like Ralph Lauren and Tapestry's Coach division can pass costs to consumers without losing demand.

Avoid:

- Companies with heavy China reliance or low-margin product lines.

- Firms lacking agility (e.g., overreliance on transshipped goods or inflexible supply chains).

Conclusion: Bet on the Agiles and the Luxe

The apparel sector's winners will be those that turn tariffs into opportunities. Nike's bold diversification and premium pricing, Ralph Lauren's tech-driven adaptability, and Tapestry's margin resilience position them as top picks. Investors should overweight these names while staying cautious on companies lacking both geographic flexibility and pricing leverage.",,N,,2025-07-08 23:59:02.826714

Mozee’s road-legal, 12-passenger electric vehicles aim to close the first- and last-mile transit gap that’s dogged dense urban zones for decades.

Now, the Arlington-based mobility pioneer has partnered with Dallas-based 46 Labs—a 13-year-old global business communications firm that calls itself “the carrier’s carrier”—to provide the backbone that keeps its driverless shuttles connected in real time.

Founded in 2012, 46 Labs operates the Peeredge Orchestration Platform, which handles daily voice and messaging traffic for hundreds of global carriers and Fortune 500 companies. Its infrastructure helps large operators manage multi-vendor networks and maintain service reliability at scale.

46 Labs’ system can track each Mozee shuttle like a separate mobile point, giving the startup real-time visibility as it scales up its mobility operations, according to the announcement. The network could also allow the vehicles to double as roaming hotspots during major events, the companies said.

Modular mobility, assembled in Arlington

Mozee’s AI-powered approach to what it calls “modular agile transit” uses self-driving electric shuttles and real-time route adjustments. The fleet, with vehicles that can travel up to 45 miles per hour, can flex to different needs, so cities, campuses, airports, and venues can adapt to shifting crowds and conditions.

The company said it wants to help cities move beyond the “transportation trap” and rethink how people connect.

“Cities are asking the wrong question,” Mozee wrote in a recent post. “Instead of ‘How do we improve mass transit?’ they should be asking: ‘If 20th-century transit no longer works, how will cities move people in the 21st century?’”

Founded in 2021, Mozee announced its headquarters move from Dallas to Arlington last year, which includes plans for a final assembly plant. The 87,000-square-foot facility is intended to serve as an advanced manufacturing site using 3D printing for some parts before final assembly. The city backed the move with up to $4 million in incentives, and Mozee has pledged more than 100 new jobs with average salaries around $100,000.

Mozee’s first major test bed is Arlington’s Entertainment District, with crowds from Cowboys and Rangers games, concerts, IndyCar races, and, soon, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“The Entertainment District, with its frequent, high-volume events, offers a real-world setting to demonstrate the convenience and efficiency of our autonomous vehicles,” co-founder Hoyt Fuller told UTA’s The Shorthorn last year. He also noted that Mozee was exploring a potential pilot partnership with UTA focused on V2X, or Vehicle-to-Everything technology.

Networking for scale

Reliable, secure connectivity will be key as Mozee expands its fleet in real-world settings, according to the companies.

“Mozee is reimagining what it means to move through modern cities, and we’re proud to deliver the network foundation that keeps their vehicles connected,” 46 Labs CEO Trevor Francis said in the partnership announcement.

“As mobility continues to evolve, partnerships like this highlight the growing need for reliable infrastructure—built not only for scalability, but to help reshape legacy systems with flexible, future-ready innovation.”

Mozee Co-Founder and CEO Shawn Taikratoke said the partnership helps the company “lead the shift toward smarter, more human-centered mobility.”

The dedicated communications backbone is designed to minimize risk and keep the system running even during broader outages.

“This partnership helps us deliver the power of modular agile transit to meet today’s transit challenges,” Taikratoke said. “We’re proud to find a partner who moves at our speed to ensure our autonomous system remains responsive, secure, and adaptable in a dynamic operating environment.”

For both companies, it’s an example of local tech talent building real-world solutions close to home, with larger ambitions on the horizon.

“As two fast-growing DFW companies, we’re excited to partner to shape the future of mobility right here in North Texas—and scale it globally,” Mozee wrote on LinkedIn.

Once a cornerstone of American banking, Wells Fargo has navigated dramatic highs and lows over its nearly 170-year history. Today, under the unwavering stewardship of CEO Charles Scharf, the $1.93 trillion-asset institution is not just rebuilding trust; it's meticulously modernizing its operations and aggressively refocusing on its core financial services to reclaim its formidable position in the industry.

Charles Scharf's Path to the Helm: The ""Chainsaw Charlie"" Era

Charles Scharf arrived at Wells Fargo in September 2019 with an urgent mandate: to meticulously repair a bank profoundly bruised by scandal. A Harvard College graduate with an MBA from NYU Stern, Scharf forged his executive acumen during pivotal stints at Visa – where he served as CEO from 2012 to 2016 – and at BNY Mellon. His reputation for disciplined cost-cutting, strategic restructuring, and rigorous risk management made him the compelling choice to lead the turnaround after the infamous cross-selling scandal, which had already seen two prior CEOs depart.

Within months, Scharf earned the evocative moniker “Chainsaw Charlie” for his decisive actions, which included eliminating underperforming units and aggressively slashing discretionary spending. This wasn't merely about cutting costs; it was about surgical precision to streamline operations and reallocate resources where they could be most effective. By the end of 2024, the bank’s board unequivocally signaled their confidence, rewarding his efforts with a $31.2 million compensation package – a 7.6 percent increase on the prior year – comprised of a $2.5 million base salary, a $7.2 million cash bonus, and $21.5 million in long-term equity awards. This substantial package underscored the perceived value of his transformative, albeit sometimes challenging, leadership.

Rebuilding Trust and Modernizing Infrastructure: A Cultural Overhaul

Scharf immediately prioritized a fundamental overhaul of core systems and a radical strengthening of internal controls – efforts directly necessitated by the bank’s devastating 2016 fake-accounts scandal. That episode, where employees secretly opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts to meet aggressive sales targets, led to over $3 billion in fines and, critically, a unique seven-year asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Under Scharf, Wells Fargo has poured significant investment into its risk and compliance teams, onboarding thousands of new professionals. They have deployed sophisticated fraud-detection software and, most crucially, meticulously rebuilt its entire sales culture. This monumental shift moved away from purely product-sales metrics towards genuinely rewarding positive customer outcomes. While such sweeping changes inevitably present challenges to employee morale and can feel disruptive, the strategic intent has been to instill a deep-rooted culture of ethical conduct and accountability from the top down. Branch renovations, emphasizing collaborative spaces and digital integration, further signal a tangible commitment to a more customer-centric future.

Core Financial Services: A Strategic Recalibration

Wells Fargo steadfastly remains one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. banks alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Its primary lines of business continue to generate significant revenue, though a strategic recalibration is underway:

Consumer Banking and Lending: With over 4,100 branches and 13,000 ATMs, this segment remains a cornerstone, serving retail customers with checking, savings, mortgages, and auto loans. While previously a mortgage powerhouse, Wells Fargo is deliberately de-emphasizing home-loan origination in favor of more fee-based businesses, focusing lending more on existing, deep-rooted client relationships.

Wealth and Investment Management: Through Wells Fargo Advisors and Wealth & Investment Management, this segment provides critical financial planning, brokerage services, and trust administration. This capital-light, fee-generating business has been a key focus during the asset cap period and is poised for continued growth.

Commercial Banking: Corporate clients rely on Wells Fargo for comprehensive Treasury management, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. This area is a prime target for expanded deposit-taking and lending now that growth restrictions are lifted.

Wholesale and Investment Banking (Wells Fargo Securities): This division offers underwriting, M&A advisory, and debt capital markets solutions. Having been constrained by the asset cap, this segment is now positioned for significant expansion.

In 2024, the firm reported a robust $82.3 billion in revenue and $19.7 billion in net income, powerfully underscoring a decisive return to profitability and operational stability after years of stifling regulatory constraints. The strong growth in investment banking fees and wealth management income reflects Scharf's strategic pivot towards higher-margin, fee-based businesses.

Turning the Page on Asset Restrictions: A New Growth Trajectory

In a pivotal development in June 2025, the Federal Reserve officially lifted its asset cap, a resounding signal of confidence in Wells Fargo’s extensive reforms and transformed governance. This removal marks the culmination of a painstaking journey and liberates the bank to pursue new growth avenues.

With this significant barrier dissolved, Wells Fargo is now strategically poised to:

Aggressively expand commercial deposits: Attracting new corporate clients and leveraging its vast nationwide footprint.

Reinforce Trading & Capital Markets: Scaling up fixed-income and equity trading desks to regain market share and boost fee income.

Increase lending across core segments: While home lending shifts, the bank can now grow its loan portfolio more broadly, particularly in commercial and investment banking.

This renewed freedom to grow is expected to enhance competitiveness, optimize its balance sheet, and ultimately drive higher returns for shareholders. Investor reaction has been largely positive, with Wells Fargo's stock experiencing a noticeable uplift following the asset cap removal, as analysts now view the bank as ""more than a remediation story."" However, Scharf has cautioned that the bank remains vigilant, with ongoing regulatory consent orders requiring continued focus on risk management. The road ahead demands a delicate balance: seizing growth opportunities while steadfastly maintaining the rigorous controls painstakingly put in place.

What is Wells Fargo CEO’s salary? In 2024, Charles Scharf’s total compensation was $31.2 million, including base pay, cash bonuses, and long-term equity awards, reflecting the board's confidence in his transformative leadership during the bank's turnaround.

Who is the current CEO of Wells Fargo? The current CEO and President is Charles W. Scharf, appointed in September 2019 and specifically charged with leading the post-scandal transformation and rebuilding trust.

What is Wells Fargo known for? Wells Fargo is best known for its extensive branch network, its diversified financial services—ranging from consumer banking to investment management—and its historic role as a ""Big Four"" U.S. bank, now also for its rigorous journey of regulatory compliance and internal reform.

Why is Wells Fargo in trouble? The bank’s reputation suffered severely after the 2016 cross-selling scandal, where employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts to meet sales targets. This crisis led to billions in fines, significant leadership changes, and a Federal Reserve asset cap that lasted until June 2025, from which Charles Scharf has successfully guided the bank's emergence.

Under Charles Scharf’s leadership, Wells Fargo is balancing the pursuit of robust business growth with the disciplined governance and cultural transformation needed to definitively prevent past mistakes from repeating. As it capitalizes on its newfound regulatory freedom, the bank’s enduring success will hinge on maintaining this crucial equilibrium – a testament to its arduous journey from crisis to renewed potential.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:31.247376

With over a dozen items affected—including electronics, appliances, food, and automotive products—shoppers are urged to review their recent purchases.

Whether it’s a risk of fire, contamination, or mechanical malfunction, here’s a breakdown of the recalled items and what you need to know if you’ve purchased any of them.

Costco Items on Recall

Anker Power Bank (Model A1257)

Anker has voluntarily recalled certain batches of this power bank due to a potential issue with lithium-ion battery cells that could lead to overheating. Although the likelihood of malfunction is low, customers are advised to stop using the device. Affected customers can receive a free replacement by submitting a photo of the unit with specific details, including the model number and the word “recalled” written on the power bank.

Anker PowerCore 10000 (Model A1263)

This power bank is being recalled due to a risk of overheating, which poses a fire hazard. Anker advises customers to immediately stop using the device and check their website for details on how to receive a replacement or refund.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

Reports have surfaced of weight plates detaching from the handle during use, posing a serious injury risk. Customers should immediately stop using the dumbbells and follow recall procedures for a fix or replacement.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires (Size 235/40R19)

This tire model is missing the required Department of Transportation (DOT) certification marking. While the tires meet performance standards, the lack of a DOT stamp could lead to improper use. Customers are advised to return the product.

Fresh and Ready Prepared Sandwiches and Salads

These ready-to-eat items, sold at Costco Business Centers in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Washington, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a serious health risk, especially for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler

The tow handle on this cooler may cause fingertip injuries, including pinching, crushing, or even amputation. Use of this product should be discontinued immediately until further notice.

Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu (Item #1729556)

A specific lot (P140082) of this over-the-counter medication may contain foreign material due to a manufacturing issue. Distributed to select stores in the Midwest and Southeast, this product should not be used and can be returned to Costco for a full refund.

Midea U-Shaped Window AC Units

Multiple item numbers are involved in this recall due to water pooling inside the unit, which can lead to mold and potentially cause infections or respiratory problems. If you own one of these units, discontinue use and check if your model is included in the recall.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate Tires (Size 185/60R15C)

Michelin is recalling this tire model due to a failure to meet federal safety standards for endurance. Sections of tread rubber may detach from the tire shoulder, increasing the risk of an accident. Drivers should stop using these tires and contact Michelin for replacement.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer

Certain models have been found to allow the pressure lid to open while the unit is still pressurized, potentially causing severe burns. Consumers should avoid using the pressure cooking function until a replacement lid is received.

Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter (Item #1567456)

This scooter model may suffer from a folding mechanism failure, which poses a risk of falling. Owners are instructed not to use the scooter until they have received and installed a free repair kit.

Sublue Underwater Scooter

Battery packs in Sublue Mix models manufactured between June 2018 and March 2024 have a risk of overheating and catching fire. Affected models include MIXAW01, MIXAB01, and MIXSB01. A free battery replacement program is in place, and users are advised to stop using the devices immediately.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18-Pack

Some lots sold in Texas and Louisiana may be contaminated with pseudomonas bacteria, which occur naturally in water but can pose a health risk to individuals with weakened immune systems. Affected customers should not consume the product.

What You Should Do

If you’ve purchased any of these items, check your receipts or order history to confirm. Visit Costco’s official recall page for instructions on how to return or replace affected products. In most cases, you’ll receive a full refund or free replacement. Taking quick action can help prevent safety issues for you and your household.

Publicis Groupe’s ambitions were clinical and clear during the Cannes Lions festival last month where it launched an all-out challenge to TV’s untouchable – the Super Bowl.

The French marketing services group, which is outperforming its global holding company peers in the equity markets, launched a real-time campaign during the Cannes Lions challenging the Super Bowl by showing it can build the audience reach of one $8m Superbowl TV ad – with 127 million viewers – in a 24 hour window for somewhere between 5-25 per cent of the cost using influencers and creators.

The holdco has outlaid an estimated $650m in the past 12 months acquiring creator-influencer platforms - Captiv8 and Influencer – which it is wiring up to its consumer identity and targeting engine, CoreID, housed in data unit Epsilon, which it acquired in 2019 for upwards of $4bn. Publicis Group also acquired Australian-founded global retail media ad platform, Citrus Ad, in 2021 for $205m and locally it paid an estimated $30-40m for independent media agency Atomic 212° last December, announcing the deal the following month.

Next on Publicis' agenda to build out its legacy media eating audience ecosystem and compete with the global tech-media giants, which dominated the sprawling beachfront showcase instalments in Cannes last month, is gaming.

Big names and games

Zenith ANZ CEO Jason Tonelli told a breakfast briefing in Cannes last month, put on by iion, a specialist programmatic gaming adtech player. The firm houses tier one titles such as Call of Duty, Minecraft, Fortnite, FIFA and GTA – used by brands like L’Oreal, KFC, Lego, Samsung, Ikea and Coca-Cola to target the 1.4bn global gamers on iion’s “unified” platform.

Advertisers have jumped into the tech-media platforms because of their enormous scale and ability to allow easy access and targeting of their users, who leave an abundant trail of personal data captured and monetised by the global players. Gaming, however, has been sidelined for a decade despite a huge, highly-engaged user base.

Community and connections

Citing Zenith’s Australian single source consumer research panel, Tonelli said 78 per cent of gamers were playing every week, 28 per cent daily. “When you think about that from an Australian perspective, 56 per cent of Australians are watching television every day, so you're starting to see where this reach shift is starting to play,"" Tonelli said. “It's a lean-in environment, and we're all advocates for the gaming industry here. You're not leaning back. You're engaged in it. So there's connection and community – all those things are really important when you think about community, when you think about fandom, when you think about engagement, and when you think about attention – gaming delivers that. So now, with some data behind it, it's got scale.”

Unified programmatic games

“We’ve been talking about insurance here [at the Cannes session], we've got insurance clients too. When I start to think about insurance, where are young people? 18-24 year-olds for health insurance, car insurance etc, where are they going? They're going to social right now to be educated about insurance, they are not going to their parents like we did. And in social they’re using influencers or ChatGPT. But there's a wonderful opportunity if you think creatively about gaming and how health insurance plays a role. So what we need to do is be creative about how that solves problems for the consumer that's using those things.”

Tonelli said iion was the first time a programmatic platform had properly unified the disparate gaming sector to launch campaigns across multiple publishers with the IAB measurement standards in viewability and attention – iion, for instance, incorporates attention metrics from Amplified Intelligence in its reporting.

Publicis as a platform

Gaming, per Tonelli, is emerging as another channel alongside creators and influencers that Publicis Groupe has identified as major audience reach alternatives to TV and legacy media.

“It's quite interesting. I think when you start to consider some of our strategic acquisitions … when you think about Influential, Captiv8 and Epsilon, you start to see how we're helping our clients really build reach, build scale, and really think about identity as a solution,” Tonelli said.

“Some of the big conversations you're getting out of Cannes at the moment are really around experiences and engagement as well as efficiencies. And when you start to put those things together, I think influencers and gaming have a massive role in delivering those three things.""

Building out those platforms affords holdco agencies a greater degree of protection from their platform rivals now openly telling brands they can hand over budgets and outcomes and let their algorithms do the rest.

Some ex-holdco global execs think becoming platforms in their own right is perhaps the major networks' only hope of long-term survival. Dave Gaines, a former GroupM and WPP global exec turned founder at independent agency Media by Mother, holds that view.,

“49 per cent of the money in the [advertising] world goes to Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. Those companies are technology and data operations, and they own all of their media inventory,” said Gaines.

“All of the big holding companies are effectively trying to replicate that model. They're just trying to mirror those three large companies in order that they can compete and big clients, certainly in the US when you pitch, they come looking for those kind of things ... Alphabet, Meta and Amazon have reshaped the way that media is delivered.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/Jason%20Tonelli%20-%20Lead%20Image%204.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:23.478222

A NEW HORIZON: Monument Advocacy is merging with Horizon Government Affairs, gaining a major boost in health care lobbying firepower in the firm’s first big private equity-fueled acquisition.

— Horizon pulled in $1.7 million in lobbying revenues last year for work on behalf of clients including PhRMA and McKesson as well as industry coalitions including the Health Innovation Alliance. Horizon and its staff will be folded into Monument, which brought in $14.5 million in lobbying fees last year from clients including Amazon, Starbucks, Waymo, Netflix, Albertsons, Alaska Airlines, Zillow and the Consumer Brands Association.

— The merger will give the combined firm a larger platform with which it can capitalize on the growing overlap between the tech and health care sectors on issues like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, John Murray, Monument’s chief executive, said in an interview.

— “For me, in terms of our strategy at Monument, health care has always been number one on my list” of acquisition targets, he added. “It’s an important part of the business, and there’s so much opportunity to cross-pollinate with our tech practice and our public affairs practice in particular.”

— That’s especially true now, with sweeping change coming to the sector as part of Republicans’ megabill, which is now law. “All of the health care pieces that are in the reconciliation bill now have to be implemented,” said Murray. “There’s a long road still to make tweaks and advocate on behalf of clients who want to continue to be a part of that process.”

— The combined firm will also be well-positioned to work on issues related to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement by drawing on Monument’s active food and agriculture practice and Horizon’s health expertise. “We see that as a huge opportunity,” Murray told PI.

— Murray called the Horizon merger the “first piece of a multi-pronged business strategy” powered by an investment last year from Boston-based Everlane Equity Partners. For Monument’s next expansion, Murray said the firm is eyeing a presence in California, New York, Texas and Florida in addition to more financial services capabilities in D.C.

BUSTOS LOBBYING FOR OPENAI: Former Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) has registered to lobby for OpenAI as the ChatGPT maker continues to grow its lobbying footprint. Bustos, who’s now a partner at Mercury Public Affairs, began lobbying for the AI giant back in May on issues related to AI policy, along with her son Nick Bustos, who’s also at Mercury, according to a disclosure filing.

— OpenAI has quickly ramped up its advocacy operations in Washington, where the firm dropped more than $1.7 million on lobbying last year. OpenAI retains three other outside firms — Miller Strategies, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and DLA Piper — in addition to its team of in-house lobbyists, but Bustos is the only former member of Congress currently lobbying for the company as it presses for a light-handed approach to regulating AI.

FIRST IN PI — FETTERMAN CHIEF HANGS A SHINGLE: Krysta Juris, who most recently served as chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), has returned to K Street to launch Two Lights Strategies, a government relations and public affairs firm.

— Juris spent nearly a decade working for the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid before joining the lobbying firm Subject Matter (now Avoq). She then moved over to public policy roles at Meta and Stripe before heading back to the Hill in 2023 to serve as deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff to Fetterman.

— Juris said in an email that she struck out on her own for a “more focused, hands-on approach” to advocacy. “Starting my own firm allows me to work closely with a smaller group of clients across sectors and bring the full weight of my experience to each engagement,” she wrote.

LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP AT AVOQ: Nicole Cornish is stepping down as chief executive of Avoq after eight years with the lobbying and public affairs firm, per PRovoke Media’s Paul Holmes. During Cornish’s tenure as CEO, the firm (then Subject Matter) scored an investment from Los Angeles-based private equity firm Coral Tree Partners, which enabled its acquisition of the PR shop Kivvit a year later. The merged firm rebranded as Avoq not long after.

— Cornish, who will step down at the end of the year, plans to “remain on the board and actively support a seamless leadership transition and continue to provide ongoing strategic guidance as the firm moves forward,” according to the firm.

FLYING IN: Nearly three dozen retailers are in town today for the National Retail Federation’s latest fly-in on tariff issues. The delegation was set to meet with around 60 offices on the Hill in addition to meeting with majority and minority staff for the House Small Business Committee and Senate Finance Committee, senior officials at the Treasury Department and representatives from the Small Business Administration.

— This is NRF’s fourth fly-in in as many months focused on illustrating the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs — to say nothing of the uncertainty caused by the administration’s constantly shifting goalposts and deadlines — on the retail industry.

SPEAK NOW: “The I.R.S. said on Monday that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates to their congregations, carving out an exemption in a decades-old ban on political activity by tax-exempt nonprofits,” The New York Times’ David Farenthold reports.

— The statement, made in a court filing, “seemed to formalize what already seemed to be the agency’s unspoken policy,” but it follows a yearslong push by Trump to revoke the so-called Johnson Amendment. “The National Council of Nonprofits, which represents 30,000 such groups, warned that allowing tax-exempt groups to endorse candidates could lead to a future where political groups use nonprofits as a kind of legal disguise,” per the NYT.

— The IRS’ shift is “not about religion or free speech, but about radically altering campaign finance laws,” the council’s president, Diane Yentel, argued in a statement. “The decree could open the floodgates for political operatives to funnel money to their preferred candidates while receiving generous tax breaks at the expense of taxpayers who may not share those views.”

FIRST IN PI II – AUSTIN DODGES SPECIFICS ON CONSULTING FIRM: Former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is defending himself from charges of influence peddling lodged at him by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) but didn’t answer most of their specific questions about his new consulting firm in a response obtained by Daniel.

— He told them in a letter sent on Tuesday that he “will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards” and “will abide by all relevant post-government restrictions and ethics pledges.” He said in the letter that he doesn’t lobby and won’t lobby in the future. During his confirmation process, Austin had pledged to not lobby after his tenure as defense secretary but the senators believe that his new D.C. strategic advisory firm doesn’t live up to the spirit of his promise.

— He didn’t answer whether he would help clients in “making communications [to] or appearances” in front of the Defense Department, whether he would work for foreign governments or entities, whether he’d recuse himself from issues he worked with as defense secretary, which clients he is working for and if they’ve had contracts with the Pentagon, among other questions. “At our firm, we believe that there’s no substitute for integrity, honesty, candor, discretion, and the highest quality of work,” he told Warren and Scott.

— “It’s extremely disappointing that Secretary Austin has undermined the public trust and refused to answer simple questions about his lucrative new role,” Warren said in a statement to PI. “At the very least, Secretary Austin should stop dodging our questions and be transparent with the American people. I will continue fighting to close the revolving door and root out corruption.”

— A spokesperson for Austin declined to comment. A spokesperson for Scott didn’t immediately have a comment on how he planned to try to get the answers he and Warren want.

In the last few months alone, we’ve seen Unilever dedicate half of its ad budget to social channels in an “influencer first” push, Publicis Groupe acquired Captiv8, and WPP created an entire influencer function for L’Oreal.

These shifts in the industry aren’t coincidental. The influencer marketing sector is projected to reach a global market size of $32.55 billion by 2025. Spurred by a seismic change in how consumers interact with media, 92 percent of consumers trust influencer recommendations over traditional advertising, and influencer campaigns led to a 24 percent increase in brand credibility.

As a result of this, brands are finding that micro and nano creators (i.e., those with smaller but highly engaged audiences) are proving particularly effective in creating authentic connections. This allows brands of all sizes to access scalable, credible storytelling. And businesses of all sizes are looking to tap into this channel, earning $6.50 for every $1 spent on influencer marketing, with the top 13 percent earning $20 or more, according to a recent survey by Tomoson. Influencer marketing is proving not only influential but measurably impactful.

AI as a Transformative Force in Campaign Optimization

Artificial intelligence is redefining how brands approach influencer marketing, offering a salve to the industry’s biggest Achilles heel: poor scalability. Typically, influencer programs struggled to keep pace with budgets. Every extra dollar dedicated to influencer budgets meant an extra dollar needed on the headcount to service that budget. Cataloging posts, identifying trends, reporting, managing approvals … every step required human engagement.

Related story: From Influence to Intelligence: The Rise of AI-Driven Creator Commerce

AI solves this issue by analyzing millions of posts in seconds. It can recommend the most effective formats, posting times, caption lengths, and even aesthetic elements tailored to specific audiences. Perhaps most critically, AI enables more advanced performance measurement. Sentiment analysis tools now assess emotional resonance and track shifts in brand perception, offering brands a more nuanced understanding of campaign impact than surface-level metrics alone can provide.

Not All AI is Created Equal

So the answer is simple, use AI right? Not quite. Not all AI models are created equal, and this point is especially pertinent for retailers. AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. If you’re using ChatGPT or an off-the-shelf equivalent, you’ll just get generic outputs. With retailers relying more heavily on a blend of influencer sizes than other sectors, this tailored information is crucial to ensuring campaign success. Retailers typically have more activations throughout the year than other industries, which adds even more complications. More influencers, used more frequently, to activate more campaigns.

A Move Toward Long-Term Strategic Partnerships

Tied to this is the move from transactional, one-off campaigns to long-term, strategic partnerships. These ongoing relationships help build audience trust through repeated exposure to a consistent brand voice, making the content feel more authentic and less opportunistic. A familiar creator whose brand reinforces the values and message of your own is like gold dust.

Long-term collaborations are often more cost effective, with better rates negotiated across multiple activations. Plus, creators who understand a brand deeply can deliver more informed, compelling content. Strategically, these partnerships allow brands to develop ongoing narrative arcs, using a trusted voice to communicate different aspects of their value over time rather than relying on fragmented, one-off messages from multiple influencers.

As influencer marketing continues to evolve, brands that adopt AI-powered tools, spread their presence across platforms, and cultivate long-term creator partnerships will be best equipped to connect authentically with audiences and adapt to ongoing change in the space.",https://network.napco.com/total-retail/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2022/05/GettyImages-1153698496.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:02.647038

Those levies range roughly from 25% to 40%.

Here is a breakdown on the potential tariff exposure for U.S. consumer apparel and footwear companies, based on where their manufacturing operations are located.

RALPH LAUREN:

Ralph Lauren produces most of its goods outside the United States, with about 19% from Vietnam and 15% from China, according to an April Raymond James report. The company said in May that supply chain is diversified enough to allow it to deal with supply disruptions.

NIKE:

Nike imported about 43% of its goods into the United States, according to Raymond James. Its sports footwear manufacturing is 50% from Vietnam, 27% from Indonesia, and 18% from China, according to Bernstein analysts. Sports apparel production breaks down as follows: 28% from Vietnam, 16% from China, and 15% from Cambodia. The company in June said it would allocate production differently to try to deal with the tariffs.

SKECHERS:

Skechers sources about 40% of its products from both China and Vietnam, according to Raymond James. The company has been redirecting imports away from China and relocating some production.

CAPRI:

Capri’s Michael Kors line is mostly produced in Asia, while Italy is its primary production source for Jimmy Choo. The company has been expanding production in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia.

TAPESTRY:

Tapestry’s sources primarily from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines, which combined represent about 70% of its production, the company noted in its May earnings release.

AMERICAN EAGLE:

American Eagle sources primarily in Asia, Raymond James wrote. The company is reducing its sourcing from China in 2025.

ABERCROMBIE & FITCH:

Abercrombie & Fitch’s sourcing was as follows: 35% from Vietnam, 22% from Cambodia, 12% from India, 7% from China, and 25% “other” in fiscal year 2024, according to Raymond James.

LULULEMON:

Lululemon fabric sourcing is 35% from Taiwan, 28% from China, 11% from South Korea, according to Raymond James analysts. Manufacturing is 40% Vietnam, 17% Cambodia, 11% Sri Lanka, 11% Indonesia, 7% Bangladesh.

WASHINGTON, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant Air pilots represented by Teamsters Local 2118 are raising serious questions about Allegiant's leadership after the company this week sold its failed Sunseeker Resort while continuing to stall contract negotiations for 1,400 union pilots.

The airline claims the sale of its unsuccessful hotel project signals a renewed focus on its core airline operations, but their actions tell a different story.

""Allegiant's executives have wasted billions on failed side hustles while refusing to fairly pay the pilots who actually keep this carrier in the air,"" said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien. ""Allegiant owes our members over $200 million in hard-earned retention bonuses. The Teamsters demand accountability and a fair contract now from this greedy, corruptible employer.""

Allegiant pilots have been stuck in negotiations for over four years. While others across the airline industry have secured pay increases and improved working conditions in recent years, Allegiant has refused to pay industry standard wages and is asking pilots to make concessions on quality of life and scheduling issues.

Since March 2021, Allegiant's market value has decreased by 78 percent, with a current market cap of $1.3 billion. The company lost $520 million on the sale of its ill-fated Sunseeker Resort, which is equal to over half of the company's current market value. The sale of the South Florida hotel follows a pattern of frivolous spending by the airline. With impractical ventures outside its core airline operations, from sports stadiums to luxury hotels and golf courses, Allegiant has burned millions of dollars on corporate pet projects.

Corporate financial mismanagement has left the company ill-equipped to resolve outstanding contract negotiations for pilots, but the Teamsters continue to call on Allegiant to return to the bargaining table.

""Management at Allegiant has no ability to lead this company. They have no allegiance to the hardworking, dedicated pilots,"" said Greg Unterseher, Teamsters Airline Division Director, Above-the-Wing. ""The Teamsters Union has zero confidence that Allegiant will bargain in good faith, but this company must be held to account.

Test and learn fatigue While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.","Either RMNs deliver or advertisers pull back spend.

“This year, you’re starting to see more streamlining, more material partnerships start to transpire because [RMNs] understand that having the data alone is not the full story,” said Deanna Mulkeen, head of media investment at Wpromote. The full story, she added, is “data, scaled inventory, reach and eyeballs all through to closed loop measurement.”

Media buyers are focused on total commerce strategies, full-funnel measurement and total transparency in the off-platform push. Amazon may still rule the roost with its data and ad ecosystem, but other players like Walmart and Instacart are working to close the gap, media buyers told Digiday.

Here’s a look at how the retail media landscape is shaping up in the second half of the year:

Amazon and the AMC ‘Holy Grail’

In the retail media network arms race, there seems to be Amazon and then everyone else. According to media buyers, that’s because of the tech giant’s sheer scale, first-party data, and its demand-side platform (DSP) that’s been catching the eye of non-endemic advertisers. More comparisons are being made between Amazon’s DSP to DSPs like Trade Desk or DV360, per Mulkeen.

Amazon Marketing Cloud, however, seems to be “the glue” connecting top and bottom of funnel media, said Damien Bianchi, group media director of retail media and commerce at VML. That full-funnel effect is what retail media networks have been vying for in the push to off-site media, taking RMNs beyond on-clicks and ROAS to deeper, long-term business goals, like household penetration and customer lifetime value, Bianchi added.

“If you’re taking advantage of it correctly, you’ll know exactly what type of Amazon media to serve specific cohorts at very specific times of the year,” he said.

But Walmart and Instacart are still making a play for their share of the full-funnel ad spend and were among the flurry of announcements during Cannes inking partnerships around measurement and off-platform ads.

Blurring budget lines

Internally, brand budget lines are also blurring as retailers push to become full-funnel media channels. Historically, dollars were siloed — either labeled shopper marketing spend or national media spend, per the three media buyers Digiday spoke with for this story. But the type of spend is changing as RMNs expand their capabilities beyond search and display ads on site to encompass video, streaming and social commerce.

It’s less that dollars are being shifted from one budget to another, and more that brands are unifying brand and performance budgets.

“We’re not seeing dollars being pulled out of existing brand building campaigns just yet,” said Anthony Costanzo, chief analytics officer at Mile Marker, an independent media agency.

Off-platform push

Retail media is seemingly hitting its maturation curve. Retailers inked partnerships with streaming services, social media platforms and other third-party partners to extend media capabilities beyond their owned-and-operated channels.

But as much as the space has grown up, buyers say there’s more to go and they’re still left with questions : Who controls access to the inventory? Who controls access to the audiences and delivery of the media strategies? Is the retailer to own that strategy and provide it as a managed service or is the advertiser in control of the off-platform media?

To help get advertisers over the hurdle, retailers are offering incentives, like co-funding (or dollar matching programs) off-platform investments, opportunities to test new ad formats, dedicated resourcing support and, perhaps most importantly, measurement, per Costanzo. The latter is especially true for larger players in the space who have droves of data and insights, he added.

“Measurement is being used as an incentive for a lot of these partnerships, because it’s something that’s in such high demand,” Costanzo said.

Test and learn fatigue

While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.

Whether advertisers buy into it comes down to sales as the appetite for testing and learning — especially as economic uncertainty looms — is shrinking, said Bianchi.

He added, “If brands are able to effectively create awareness and move product, move SKUs at a very effective rate on the bigger retailers right now, there’s not what I would call a compelling reason to do test and learns on smaller retailers unless there’s some kind of incentive.”

Heading into the second half of the year, retail media’s trajectory is likely one of more investment, but also more scrutiny and pressure to deliver at parity with the broader digital media ecosystem — think Meta and Google.

“This industry loves to talk about measurement, but in reality, there’s so much more sophistication that can be realized,” said Wpromote’s Mulkeen.",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/retail-network-digiday_b0a4ee.gif,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:02.140340

In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028.","(NewsNation) — Major American brands have vowed to remove synthetic food dyes from their products, but M&M’s and Skittles, made by Mars, remain colorful holdouts.

Mars has continued to use synthetic dyes in its candies after backing off a 2016 plan to remove all artificial colors from its food portfolio.

The company reversed course after it found that consumer attitudes varied by country, with Europeans largely opposed to synthetic dyes, while others preferred artificially colored treats, according to the Mars website.

Synthetic dyes have come under fire recently from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wants them removed from the nation’s food supply over potential health risks.

Some research has linked the dyes to behavioral health issues in children and places like Australia, Canada and the European Union generally have tighter restrictions on their use.

Despite those concerns, synthetic dyes remain widespread, appearing in nearly 1 in 5 packaged foods and beverages on U.S. grocery shelves, according to a recent study.

That study, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that confectionery companies had the most products containing synthetic dyes.

The National Confectioners Association, a candy industry trade group, criticized the study, accusing the authors of having “major gaps in their analysis.” The NCA argued that chocolate and candy differ from other foods because Americans eat them less frequently, only two to three times per week.

Both Skittles and M&M’s list several synthetic dyes on their ingredient labels, including common dyes like Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. Mars did not respond to NewsNation’s request for comment on Tuesday.

So far, Kennedy has favored the carrot over the stick, encouraging companies to voluntarily phase out synthetic dyes rather than pushing for major changes in federal regulation. Recent announcements suggest the approach is gaining traction.

Food giants like Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestle and ConAgra have all unveiled plans to move away from artificial colors in their U.S. products. The question is whether they’ll follow through.

Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has expressed skepticism, noting that many companies have failed to keep similar promises in the past.

“If the FDA were to require warning labels on synthetically dyed foods, similar to the rule in place since 2010 in the European Union, there would be a much stronger incentive for industry to reformulate,” Galligan said in a recent statement.

Several states have taken matters into their own hands, passing legislation restricting synthetic dyes. In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028. California and Virginia have banned six artificial dyes from school food.

Meanwhile, beginning in 2027, Texas will require warning labels on foods or beverages made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives.

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority,” the National Confectioners Association said in an April statement responding to Kennedy’s push to phase out synthetic food dyes.

While several artificial dyes remain, Mars has removed another controversial additive, titanium dioxide, from Skittles.

The chemical, which helps make candy appear shiny, was removed from all Skittles production at the end of last year, the company confirmed to Bloomberg in May. The ingredient was already banned in the European Union in 2022 over possible health risks.

ID18,Elevance Health (Anthem),2025-07-08 21:38:59+00:00,National Health Law Program,"Voluntary Industry Prior Authorization Commitments: Empty Promises, Little Accountability","Brit Vanneman, Ash Bliss, Alexander Cross, Daniel Young, Ian Anderson, Abigail Coursolle, Alicia Emanuel, Shandra Hartly",,,,,https://healthlaw.org/voluntary-industry-prior-authorization-commitments-empty-promises-little-accountability/,"These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization.
Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.
At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency.
But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.
The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns.","AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association recently announced a set of “voluntary commitments” to “streamline” prior authorization and “improve patient outcomes.” Major insurers including Aetna, Centene, Cigna, Elevance Health, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare have signed on.

These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization. In reality, they largely repeat existing obligations and may simply be a strategic attempt to deflect growing public criticism of insurers’ abuse of prior authorization to deny or delay care.

These commitments were developed during a roundtable hosted by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Notably, it’s unclear whether any consumers, consumer groups, or provider associations participated in shaping them. Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.

AHIP also released a policy brief to accompany the announcement, reasserting the importance of prior authorization as a tool for reducing “unnecessary” health care spending and as a “critical safeguard in patient care.” Yet, a large and growing body of research shows that prior authorization is a primary way insurers control costs while tripping up beneficiaries in red tape. This misrepresentation of harm calls into question the credibility of the initiative as whole.

Against that backdrop, a closer look at the commitments reveals that several simply echo the existing requirements already baked into federal regulation, including in the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Rule (“Rule”) finalized in January 2024. For example, the pledge to adopt FHIR-based technology for electronic submission by January 1, 2027, is not new. That deadline is already mandated under the Rule for many plans. Likewise, the promise to improve transparency by explaining denials in plain language and providing appeal guidance simply restates baseline requirements found in the Rule and required by the Affordable Care Act.

While some commitments mirror existing requirements that lend a degree of accountability (if enforced), other so-called “new” commitments totally lack meaningful oversight or accountability, relying entirely on voluntary compliance. For example, the pledge to reduce prior authorization volume by 2026 only “as appropriate” for each plan’s local market lets insurers set their own goals without standards, oversight, or consequences. These kinds of statements may sound patient-centered, but are meaningless without regulatory oversight. Another commitment – to have clinicians review denials – is already described by AHIP as an industry-wide “existing norm.” Even if that is true, there is no standard requiring plans to disclose who is making decisions, leaving consumers in the dark and unable to know whether the promise is actually being followed.

These same corporations made similar promises in 2018 and again in 2023. At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency. But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.

Other commitments are more limited than they appear. The pledge to honor existing authorizations for 90 days when a member switches plans only applies if the person has already started the approved course of treatment and only if the benefit is covered and provider is in-network under the new plan. That’s far from a robust continuity of care guarantee.

The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns. It lacks a clear definition of “real time” and creates incentives for speed over careful, individualized review. In practice, efforts to accelerate processing often rely on overworked clinicians or algorithmic tools that cut corners. A former Cigna medical director, for example, said that she and other doctors were pressured to rush through claim reviews without fully examining patient records. Her superiors were “more concerned about being fast than being right.” We have already seen how automation and AI tools can contribute to opaque, inconsistent, and clinically inappropriate denials. AHIP claims AI isn’t used to deny care without clinician input, but mounting evidence shows otherwise. Without meaningful guardrails, transparency, or independent oversight, this pledge risks increased reliance on the very technologies that have undermined trust in prior authorization.",https://healthlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/prior-authorization.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:47.851107

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — If you’re a Costco shopper, you may want to check your home for a few items the company recently recalled. Affected products include tires, power banks and air conditioners.

Consumers should stop using some of the products immediately, Costco said.

The following products were recalled:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257

This Anker Power Bank recall concerns a “potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells,” according to Anker. Though the company says the likelihood of a malfunction is “minimal,” consumers should stop using the device immediately.

Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank — Model A1263

The Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank recall was issued over concerns it may overheat and pose a potential fire risk. The product was sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022.

Danby 8,000 BTU U-Shaped Window Air Conditioner — Model DAC080B6IWB-6

This Danby air conditioner recall was issued after it was discovered that the units can fail to drain water quickly enough, allowing water to pool — and may potentially lead to mold growth. The air conditioner was sold between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022. If you have one, Danby said to stop using it immediately.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

Bridgestone said these tires “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements.” The company explains these tires were only sold as replacement equipment. The tires were manufactured June 2-22, 2024. Bridgestone explains customers can examine tires for four particular markings to determine if their tires are under recall. Tires must have all four markings, says Bridgestone. These are: 1) “Bridgestone” brand marking 2) “Blizzak 6” marking on tire line 3) “235/40R19” tire size marking and tire identification numbers of 1VR100W122224, 1VR100W122324, or 1VR100W100W122424.

Tires should not bear a “DOT” marking, says Bridgestone. The company adds that any tires reading “Blizzak LM005” are not included in the Blizzak 6 tire recall. Bridgestone says the tires can be replaced for free through Nov. 12.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

Michelin said these tires fail to meet a federal safety standard for tire endurance, and “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.” The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires recall only includes tires in the 185/60R15C size. The affected tires can be identified by their DOT sidewall markings, which will include dimension information, ID numbers and DOT start/stop dates, which can all be found in the recall notice. Michelin says replacement tires will be offered through Jul 1, 2026.

In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.
Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.","The color of your morning bowl of Froot Loops is about to change.

Major manufacturers including Nestle, General Mills, and Kraft Heinz have announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products within the next two years.

Illinois Tech Professor of Food Science and Nutrition Indika Edirisinghe says it was time for the food and beverage industry to reevaluate the use of artificial dyes in their products, but he also warns that switching over to natural food dye doesn’t come without challenges.

“One of the big challenges with the natural color is stability and consistency—they are not as stable as artificial colors,” says Edirisinghe. “Their lifespan is maybe weeks or a few months. Over time, they may degrade when exposed to environmental factors such as heat and light, resulting in discoloration. That’s going to be a challenge.”

Though Nestle says more than 90 percent of its current product categories do not contain synthetic colors, most of the products in the food industry that still do use them are targeted toward children—think breakfast cereals and sweets.

With some safety regulations having taken effect decades ago, Edirisinghe says that he thinks it’s the right time for the industry to take another look at those standards.

In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.

“In the last 20 years, the rate [of children with ADHD] has increased from 6 percent to 10 percent,” says Edirisinghe. “That’s a big jump.”

Another concern that Edirisinghe expressed is the amount of time that the industry will need to establish new formulations and comply with existing or new regulations.

Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.

“I think that timeline is feasible given the robust structures the industry has,” says Edirisinghe. “We are talking about billion-dollar companies. They have resources, they have money, and they can execute their plan in a short-term period.”",https://www.iit.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/indika-orange_pomace_1280x850.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 20:02:55.610031

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.
The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.
The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states.","CVS Health's Omnicare has been ordered to pay $948.8 million over invalid prescriptions. The company is a leading American supplier of health products and services, with net sales broken down into medical insurance plan management services, medical benefits management, retail distribution, and other activities.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan, comes after a lengthy legal battle that began in 2015.

The lawsuit, filed by former Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan and joined by the federal government, accused Omnicare of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for prescriptions at long-term care facilities. The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

Judge McMahon imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018, and awarded $406.8 million in damages, representing three times the $135.6 million awarded by a jury in April 2025. The tripling of damages was required under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment. McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying the company in 2015.

CVS Health has announced plans to appeal the judgment. The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed,"" CVS said in a statement.

The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the healthcare industry in ensuring compliance with complex regulatory requirements. It also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent and detect fraudulent activities.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed.
Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company.
In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.
The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019.","A New York judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare subsidiary to pay $948.8 million in fees and damages as part of a False Claims Act whistleblower case.

In April, a federal jury determined that Omnicare submitted more than 3.3 million fraudulent claims for prescriptions between 2010 and 2018, which led to $135.6 million in overpayments from the government.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed. However, the jurors determined that there was no injury to the federal government related to those claims.

Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company. In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.

The damages were tripled as per requirements under the False Claims Act, according to the order.

""Admittedly, that is a very big number,"" District Judge Colleen McMahon wrote in the order. ""But this is a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct.""

The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019. Omnicare provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities.

In a statement to Fierce Healthcare, a spokesperson for CVS said the company intends to appeal the penalties as ""the decision on penalties is unconstitutional, especially given the fact that there is no evidence that a single patient suffered harm.""

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing record-keeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" the spokesperson said. ""The dispensing practices referenced were limited to Omnicare, ended in 2018, were used by many others in the industry at the time, and were accepted by CMS.""

""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed,"" they said.

In the order, McMahon pushed back on CVS's argument that the penalties are unlawful.

""The violations in this case were both deliberate and egregious,"" she wrote. ""Omnicare was aware of the problems posed by its dispensing practices; it was warned again and again, both by employees and by outside (State) regulators.""

""Of great significance, Omnicare actually developed fairly straightforward means of resolving those problems but declined to implement them for years,"" she said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-2165663502.jpg?VersionId=bRHkAfJ2udDglZzvCMsyawk_HBwEbJyM,N,,2025-07-08 18:04:45.377825

As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.

For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.
If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","The strategy: Starbucks is testing better-for-you products in a bid to win over more health-conscious consumers, per Bloomberg.

The examples:

The company is experimenting with ways to remove canola oil from its ingredient list in a nod to rising consumer skepticism of seed oils, despite a lack of conclusive evidence linking them to negative health outcomes. As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.

It has removed sugar from its matcha powder and eliminated the upcharge for nondairy milk, addressing long-standing complaints from plant-based and sugar-sensitive customers.

Starbucks also tested unsweetened protein powder as a customizable add-in to its cold foam lineup, offering more nutrition-oriented options.

Why is this happening? Starbucks is repositioning its brand amid a sales slump and intensifying competition from Dutch Bros and Luckin Coffee, which are connecting with younger, value-conscious, and health-minded consumers. To stay competitive, Starbucks needs to find ways to adjust its product offerings and pricing strategies.

Our take: Starbucks is making some necessary changes—but there’s still plenty of work to do. Consumers want brands that meet them where they are, and that means prioritizing ingredient transparency and wellness without sacrificing flavor or convenience. For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.

If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","https://www.emarketer.com/content/storage/socialsharingdefault/default-image-share.png?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=628",N,,2025-07-08 18:06:02.320690

The coffee giant is currently evaluating these proposals and creating a shortlist of potential investors for the next bidding round. Starbucks plans to share financial and operational information with these selected bidders to help them assess the value of its Chinese assets.

While Starbucks initially preferred to sell only a minority stake to a partner who could help revitalize growth in its Chinese market, the company is now considering selling a larger portion based on valuation and other factors.

Prospective partners, including industry players and private equity firms, submitted non-binding proposals in June. Most are seeking a controlling stake that would give them decision-making authority and better align with their investment strategies.

Previous Title: CFO, BIC

Medtronic has named Chad Spooner CFO of its diabetes business, beginning July 14. Medtronic plans to spin out the segment into a separate, publicly traded company called MiniMed, with the goal of completing the deal within 18 months.

Spooner has more than 25 years of experience in financial leadership, according to the Tuesday announcement. He was previously CFO of consumer goods company BIC for five years, where he played a key role in a strategy to drive innovation, growth and efficiency. He also was CFO of Slingshot Health, a startup offering a marketplace to connect patients to physicians, and held a senior finance role at GE Energy.

Que Dallara, who leads Medtronic’s diabetes business and will become CEO of MiniMed, said Spooner’s financial expertise and leadership “will be instrumental as we prepare for our next chapter as an independent company.”

Medtronic announced plans to spin out the diabetes unit in May, with the intent of giving the business the funding and focus it needs to reach its full potential in a competitive market. MiniMed would be the only diabetes tech firm to sell both continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. However, other companies, including Dexcom, Abbott and Insulet, have strong product portfolios, with plans for dual-analyte sensors and patch pumps.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.","Volkswagen has formed a partnership with Uber to launch autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxis across European and American markets.

The collaboration will see Volkswagen’ s ID. Buzz minivan deployed as a robotaxi solution, combining the carmaker’s manufacturing capabilities with Uber’s global ride-hailing network.

Both companies aim to address urban mobility challenges through connected, electric and sustainable transport solutions.

What is an autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxi?

The ID. Buzz is Volkswagen’s modern interpretation of its Microbus, built on the company's Modular Electric Drive (MEB) platform.

MEB is Volkswagen’s dedicated electric vehicle architecture designed to underpin multiple battery-electric models across the group’s brands.

The vehicle incorporates a 91-kWh battery pack that provides up to 234 miles of range – and the minivan supports rapid DC charging, allowing the battery to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in 26 minutes.

Volkswagen offers both rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants, with power outputs reaching up to 335 horsepower.

“Autonomous driving is no longer a dream of the future – by 2030, it will change the everyday lives of millions of people in Europe,” says Christian Senger, Member of the Board for Fully Autonomous Mobility and Transport at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and CEO of ADMT GmbH.

ADMT GmbH is Volkswagen’s subsidiary focused on autonomous driving technology development.

Christian adds: “At the same time, our solution opens up a new business area for the German automotive industry: physical AI applications used for the common good.”

The Hamburg deployment forms part of Volkswagen’s broader strategy to integrate self-driving vehicles into existing public and private transport networks.

The testing programme provides data and operational experience ahead of commercial launches in other markets.

In 2026, Volkswagen plans to launch the ID. Buzz AV in Los Angeles under Uber’s platform.

Unlike fixed-route services, this deployment will offer on-demand ride-pooling options, with passengers able to request individual rides when required.

Volkswagen also intends to remove safety drivers from Los Angeles operations by the end of 2026.

European cities are expected to follow this timeline by 2027, marking the transition to fully autonomous commercial operations.

How Mobileye’s platform powers the ID. Buzz autonomous technology

The ID. Buzz AV also incorporates Mobileye’s autonomous driving platform.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.

The vehicle’s sensor suite comprises 13 cameras, 9 LiDAR units and 5 radar systems. LiDAR technology uses laser pulses to create detailed three-dimensional maps of surrounding environments, whilst radar systems detect objects and measure their distance and speed using radio waves.

This sensor configuration generates five gigabytes of data per second, enabling real-time mapping and object detection capabilities.

Volkswagen employs proprietary mapping tools and reduces reliance on GPS systems to improve operational resilience in challenging environments.

What makes Volkswagen’s approach different from competitors who retrofit existing electric vehicles for autonomous operation – is that it manufactures the ID. Buzz AV on dedicated production lines – which the firm claims improves cost-efficiency and reduces environmental impact through streamlined manufacturing processes.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/177cad907fc4368b21dbde6a8109e56d:efa93d8474a4924e7db4d822bb10f4c1/uber-vw.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:20.685091

Porsche’s 1H sales numbers are a mixed bag, with an overall worldwide sales decline of 6% year over year. But they also include a huge increase in the proportion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug in hybrids (PHEVs), with the brand selling a total of 36.1% plug-in models across the world – meaning EVs helped to keep the company afloat as combustion car sales dropped quite a lot.

Porsche sold more BEVs than PHEVs, with a 23.5% BEV share and 12.6% PHEV share. This represents a 14.5% increase from the previous year’s results – a big rise in EV sales alongside a drop in gas model sales (hm, where have we heard that before?).

Porsche’s strong electric performance is all the more impressive given that the brand only has two electric models so far – the Taycan and the Macan EV.

Taycan sales were down 6% year over year, which isn’t too unexpected given the model’s age at this point. Porsche has come out with new variants of the Taycan, but those are high-end ultra-performance models, which don’t generally make up the meat of any particular model’s sales numbers.

The big growth in Porsche’s EV sales came from the new electric Macan, which is going gangbusters soon after its release.

Macan is Porsche’s best-selling model, and sales were up 15% for the model overall. That number was buoyed by massive interest in the EV version, which accounted for “almost 60%” (actually 57%) of Porsche’s Macan sales – meaning the EV model sold ~134% as many units as the gas model. Totals were 25,884 for the EV, and 19,253 for combustion models.

Part of the reason for this is because Europe no longer sells the ICE Macan, but outside of Europe, it’s still available, and the EV is still popular (as far as we know, the EV isn’t quite a majority of Macan sales in the US, but it’s close to the gas model, and that’s still much higher than the national ~10% EV share, which the US is an international laggard at)

“The fully electric Macan is making a significant contribution to our proportion of electrified cars. Overall, we have succeeded in keeping sales volumes stable and balanced across the sales regions despite ongoing geopolitical challenges. Our customers continue to place great value on individualised vehicles and we will continue to expand our offerings in this area.”

-Matthias Becker, Board Member for Sales and Marketing, Porsche

We can expect, or at least hope for, similar strong EV sales performance from upcoming Porsche electric models. The next one to release will be the Cayenne EV, which we’ve seen recently setting a hillclimb record and towing lots of stuff in disguise. We expect a full release of that model within the next year.

Porsche also has both the Boxster and Cayman EVs in the pipeline for the future. The only model we’ve not yet heard real plans to electrify is the 911 (c’mon Porsche, why would you wait so long to upgrade your best model? isn’t it embarrassing to see a Macan beating a 911 off the line?)

Across regions, sales were down in Germany (primarily due to strong year-ago performance, says Porsche), China, and the rest of Europe, and up in North America and “rest of the world.” China is of particular note, where Porsche sales dropped 28%, the largest global decrease.

Western automakers have been having a really tough time in China, due to the strength of domestic competition and rapid rise in EV sales percentage there, which caught them by surprise. You can expect more of that to come as Chinese automakers will only get better, particularly as Western governments and automakers (yes, including you, Porsche) unwisely pull back on EV goals, leaving room for China to step up and become more prominent globally.

Electrek’s Take

I reviewed the Macan EV earlier this year and came away thinking that Porsche is great at making cars, but that it could still use some tweaking of its EV strategy. The car didn’t really feel like Porsche was “all-in” on EVs, and wasn’t utilizing the unique advantages of EVs to make a car that was fully focused on being electric, even though the bones of the model show the typical excellent driving dynamics that you would expect out of a Porsche.

So these numbers either show that I’m wrong about EV strategy, or show just how superior electric powertrains can be. Because even though I think there were some missteps in the design of Porsche’s electric model, it’s still just so much better than the gas model.

And, thankfully, the public and Porsche’s dealers seem to get it too. A lot of brands have a tough time selling EVs, often because their dealers refuse to. Porsche’s dealers seem to get it a lot more than a lot of companies, which is a credit to them and to Porsche as a whole for educating them properly about the strengths of their electric models.

So we’re looking forward to seeing how sales go with those future EV models… particularly the eventual and inevitable 911 (I recently drove an EV restomod 911, and it was maybe the best driving experience I’ve ever had in a car, so c’mon Porsche, if Everrati can do it then I know you can).

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy.
As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain.
RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG?
This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""","CVS Caremark, one of the three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S., stopped coverage for Eli Lilly's popular weight-loss drug Zepbound, blaming drugs like it for driving up overall plan costs.

GLP-1 products, originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, but are now FDA-approved specifically for obesity under brand names like Wegovy and Zepbound, are ""significantly contributing to overall plan costs"", CVS spokesperson Phillip Blando told FOX Business. Removing coverage of the drug will result in an estimated client savings of 10% to 15% year over year in the anti-obesity medication space for its clients who choose to cover these medications for weight loss, according to Blando.

Zepbound, the brand name for Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, was approved by the FDA in 2023 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related medical problems. Tirzepatide was already approved to treat type 2 diabetes and was sold under the brand name Mounjaro.

TRUMP SAYS DRUG PRICES WILL BE CUT BY AS MUCH AS 90%: WHAT TO KNOW

Zepbound was widely viewed as a game-changer in the fight against obesity, after participants in a late-stage study lost up to a quarter of their body weight – making it more effective than Wegovy.

Blando said the ""egregiously high list prices"" for GLP-1 products that are set by drug manufacturers are ""the single biggest barrier to patient access.""

""Many payers, including Medicare and numerous state benefit plans, have declined to cover GLP-1s for weight loss because of the unsustainably high prices set by brand pharma,"" he said.

However, there will still be exceptions if the drug is deemed a ""medical necessity."" That exemption will be reviewed ""on a case-by-case basis,"" according to Blando.

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy. As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain. PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies to decide how much medicines cost, which drugs people can get and which pharmacies are part of their network.

Pharmaceutical giants have been critical of PBMs, saying their role needs to change. Eli Lilly previously told FOX Business that the only way to lower prices for U.S. consumers is if ""intermediaries take less for themselves.""

Gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist Dr. Christopher McGowan told FOX Business that CVS Caremark’s decision to drop coverage of the drug is ""deeply disruptive for patients who are already stable and thriving on the medication.""

RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG? A NEW TRACKER CAN HELP

""We’re now seeing insurance policy override medical judgment – forcing patients to switch to an alternative that, while still effective, has been shown in head-to-head trials to produce less weight loss than Zepbound,"" McGowan said.

McGowan highlighted that GLP-1 medications ""are not interchangeable in practice, even if they appear similar on paper."" He said switching medications ""mid-journey can reverse hard-won progress.""

""For many, this isn’t just a simple substitution. It’s a high-stakes change that can affect long-term outcomes, trigger weight regain, or introduce new side effects,"" McGowan said.

This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""

This means patients with fewer choices not because of what’s best for their health, but because of behind-the-scenes rebate deals, he continued.

""In obesity care, continuity matters. Once a patient finds a medication that works, preserving that success should be the priority,"" he said. ""Instead, we’re seeing progress disrupted and patients forced to navigate treatment changes they never asked for.""

Eli Lilly told FOX Business that the company is committed to ensuring patients have access to the treatment they need.

""While not all CVS Caremark plans are impacted, we’ve made robust efforts to proactively communicate with many of the patients who may be affected and provided clear next steps through our support programs,"" Lilly said in a statement, adding that the company is encouraging patients to speak with their healthcare providers about medical necessity exceptions or alternative coverage pathways. It has also added resources on its website.

If customers do lose coverage, Eli Lilly said it expanded access through LillyDirect’s Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, which is the company's self-pay program, which removes some third-party supply chain entities, offering patients without coverage drugs at a discount.

Not John Deere.
John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.” Which is what you would expect.
It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case.","The writing is on the wall.

Should John Deere choose to defend itself in court rather than attempt to reach a settlement, it very much may be handed a massive spanking by the Justice Department, which alleges the company’s repair restrictions violate federal and state antitrust laws. See here, here and here.

In a nutshell, the Justice Department claims Deere is scamming farmers by forcing them to exclusively use Deere dealers to repair their combines and tractors when they stop running. The feds have a case.

As it turns out, it takes proprietary diagnostic software to fix broken Deere tractors. Software that Deere refuses to sell to DIY farmers or independent repair shops. Deere likes it that way because it provides the company a significant after-market revenue stream.

The four-count Federal Trade Commission lawsuit isn’t playing around, alleging Deere monopolized the restricted repair services market, violated the FTC Act by using an unfair method of competition, and violated both Minnesota and Illinois antitrust laws.

John Deere lawyers threw spaghetti at the court walls, hoping something would stick and keep it from having to defend its software at trial.

Among the arguments Deere makes are that the feds’ claims of unfair competition and monopolization are factually and legally insufficient. And for good measure — just in case the unfair competition argument went south — Deere challenged the FTC’s constitutional structure, whether states that joined in the Justice Department’s case have standing, as well as the timeliness of the states’ claims.

The ruling by Judge Iain D. Johnson, of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois-Western Division, rejected all of Deere’s legal posturing.

Johnson writes that at this stage of the case — a motion for judgment on the pleadings — he has to accept the Justice Department allegations as factual:

“The Governments say there’s a throughline between Deere’s practices: farmers have no alternatives because of the system created by Deere, which charges supracompetitive prices because of the lack of any alternatives. In technologizing its equipment, Deere makes farmers reliant on Deere’s own ADVISOR software. And, in only licensing that software to its authorized Dealers, Deere forces farmers to visit those shops instead of using closer, cheaper options.”

Johnson also noted Deere reaps massive profits from its parts business, which relies on those authorized dealers’ repairs. And Johnson says “because only Deere can create and license the ADVISOR [repair] tool, it entirely controls who (and how many) Dealers may perform restricted repairs and, by extension, how much the Dealers can charge.”

Which suggests Deere might have a significant uphill climb to refute the Justice Department.

This isn’t Johnson’s first rodeo in handling Deere’s software litigation. In late 2023, he rejected Deere’s attempt to dismiss consolidated lawsuits filed by farmers alleging that Deere conspired to restrict services for repair.

In its most recent failed motion for judgment on the pleadings, Deere recycled some of the same arguments it made in 2023, to which Johnson responded:

“Sequels so rarely beat their originals that even the acclaimed Steve Martin couldn’t do it on three tries. See Cheaper by the Dozen II, Pink Panther II, Father of the Bride II. Rebooting its earlier production, Deere sought to defy the odds. To be sure, like nearly all sequels, Deere edited the dialogue and cast some new characters, giving cameos to veteran stars like Humphrey’s Executor. But ultimately the plot felt predictable, the script derivative. Deere I received a thumbs-down, and Deere II fares no better.”

In the immediate aftermath of Johnson’s ruling no one was talking publicly. Not John Deere. Not the Justice Department. Perhaps behind the scenes, the feds and Deere are talking to each other.

The Justice Department is seeking a permanent injunction against Deere, as well as an order to make the company’s full-function service ADVISOR software available to all owners of Deere large tractors and combines.

Back in January when the outgoing Biden administration filed suit against Deere, the company said publicly:

“The complaint is based on flagrant misrepresentations of the facts and fatally flawed legal theories and it punishes innovation and procompetitive-product design. John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.”

Which is what you would expect. But I wonder if Deere higher-ups privately feel the same way. Are they willing to legally go to the mattresses, all the way to the Supreme Court? I feel as though this isn’t the type of case the Justice Department will drop if it loses at the district court.

That the Trump Justice Department hasn’t flat out dropped the case is telling. The feds appear squarely in the farmers’ camp. It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case. How might that play out?

Are Deere and the Justice Department exploring a settlement?

I imagine there are many moving pieces — many of which have nothing to do directly with the proceedings in Johnson’s court.

Right-to-repair advocates were applauding Johnson’s ruling that the antitrust law case can go forward, but whether farmers who own Deere rigs ultimately get access to the software they need to independently fix them is still far from settled.

By targeting corporations such as Albertsons, The Southern Company, and Merck, these groups are reshaping shareholder activism, forcing companies to confront the tension between social responsibility and profit-driven governance. For investors, the question is stark: Do anti-ESG campaigns represent a legitimate safeguard against corporate overreach, or a destabilizing force undermining long-term value creation?

The Bowyer Playbook: Targeting ESG's Soft Underbelly

Bowyer Research's strategy hinges on exploiting low shareholder ownership thresholds (as little as 1%) to convene special meetings and push proxy proposals. These proposals rarely win majority votes—most secure under 5% support—but their symbolic impact is profound. By framing ESG initiatives as “politicized” or financially risky, Bowyer seeks to delegitimize corporate commitments to diversity, environmental goals, and social justice.

Albertsons: Bowyer's 2024 proposal urged the supermarket giant to audit the costs of its partnerships with LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and its “diversity training” programs. The argument? Such initiatives risk alienating customers and employees with conservative values while offering no clear financial upside.

The Southern Company: A 2023 proposal demanded a cost-benefit analysis of its decarbonization plans, arguing that investments in renewables threaten shareholder returns in a fossil fuel-dependent economy.

Merck: In 2024, Bowyer called for an evaluation of how the pharmaceutical giant's DEI policies might expose it to legal risks under the Harvard affirmative action ruling, which tightened scrutiny of race-conscious practices.

The Risks of Activist Overreach

While Bowyer's proposals fail at the ballot box, their persistence creates tangible risks. First, legal and reputational costs: Companies must divert resources to respond to repeated challenges, even if they reject the proposals. Second, governance instability: Frequent special meetings may signal to investors that management is distracted from core priorities. Third, ESG devaluation: If anti-ESG groups succeed in framing ESG as a “niche” concern, companies may retreat from initiatives that could build long-term resilience (e.g., climate adaptation, inclusive workforces).

Consider Merck's case: Even if its DEI program survives, the threat of litigation could deter it from bold recruitment or supplier diversity goals. For The Southern Company, scaling back renewables might appease activists but leave it unprepared for a carbon-constrained future.

The Legal Battlefield: SEC Rules and Shareholder Democracy

Bowyer's success depends on exempt solicitations remaining a low-cost tool. However, the SEC's recent NCPPR v. SEC ruling—upholding its authority to exclude “ordinary business” proposals—could curb such campaigns. If upheld, this precedent might limit activists' ability to challenge ESG initiatives as non-pecuniary. Yet, anti-ESG groups are refining strategies, such as framing proposals as financial risk assessments (e.g., “evaluating the cost of DEI lawsuits”) to evade exclusion.

Investment Implications: Navigating the ESG-Fiduciary Tightrope

For investors, the key is to distinguish between strategic ESG integration (e.g., climate risk mitigation) and activist-driven theatrics (e.g., symbolic DEI pledges). Companies that align ESG with profitability—such as The Southern Company's balance of renewables and fossil fuels—may weather activism better than those seen as chasing “woke” reputational gains.

Actionable Insights:

1. Avoid Companies with Weak ESG-Performance Linkages: Firms using ESG as a marketing tool, not a risk management strategy, face higher reputational and financial risks from anti-ESG campaigns.

2. Monitor SEC Regulatory Shifts: A pro-ESG SEC could penalize exempt solicitations, while a deregulatory tilt might empower activists.

3. Favor Firms with Transparent ESG Cost-Benefit Analysis: Companies like Merck that publicly justify DEI investments (e.g., “diverse teams drive innovation”) are less vulnerable to Bowyer's “reckless spending” critiques.

Conclusion: The New Fiduciary Imperative

Bowyer Research's campaigns highlight a deeper truth: ESG is no longer optional but a core governance issue. Investors must demand that companies articulate how their ESG priorities align with shareholder value—whether through risk mitigation, talent retention, or market access. Those that cannot will face relentless pressure from activists and regulators alike. In this era of exempt solicitations and ideological warfare, the winners will be firms that treat ESG as a strategic asset, not a political football.",,N,,2025-07-08 19:07:30.296340

Why it matters: 3M was one of the last holdouts of major Twin Cities corporations calling their workers back and the move by the Maplewood-based company underscores a major shift happening this summer.

What they're saying: ""I believe our ability to engage, collaborate and innovate is stronger in person,"" Brown wrote to employees.

Brown wrote in his email that some employees will return right away in September, while others will need to wait for office renovations, which could take until late 2026. The policy does not apply to existing remote employees who are working distantly.

State of play: Some surveys have shown that many employees say they will find a new job if they can't work from home, but the options for remote work are dwindling among Minnesota's largest employers.

Employees at Minnesota' largest corporation, UnitedHealth Group, were called back four days a week starting on Monday. Medtronic workers will need to be in office four days a week starting Sept. 2, up from three days a week.

By the numbers: More in-person work is starting to show up in office space leasing metrics.

Quarterly absorption in the Twin Cities — which measures how much space is leased against how much is vacated or constructed — was positive for the first time since 2020, according to a new report by commercial real estate firm JLL.

JLL says a hefty amount of demand for space will keep leasing strong for the foreseeable future.

The bottom line: While the days of employees working mostly from home are over for big corporations, policies mandating three or four days in the office per week are still more flexible than pre-pandemic setups.",https://images.axios.com/vI1xiNjSCfNNdt__FaIvnm0ovD0=/0x343:5100x3212/1366x768/2025/07/08/1751999182990.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:47.450660

The warehouse retailer flagged 10 items in recent months for recalls, produced by a variety of manufacturers but sold by Costco. Some were also sold through Costco Next, a program that lets customers buy directly from brands at Costco prices.

The products range from window air conditions to power banks to car tires.

Here's what's included in the recall list:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 (Costco Next)

These power banks were included in a worldwide recall by Anker over reports that some of the items had caught fire or exploded.

Danby 8k U-Shape Window Air Conditioner (Item #1498424)

These air conditioners, sold on the Costco website between June 10, 2021, and Feb. 2, 2022, are being recalled because they could grow mold. The manufacturer says pooled water can't drain quickly enough from them, risking the growth of harmful molds.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

These Michelin-brand tires are under a recall notice because they don't meet federal guidelines for tire endurance. Federal regulators warn that the tires could increase the risk of a crash. Information to identify your tires is located on the sidewall of each tire, directly above the bead.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

These tires, sold only as replacements, don't meet federal safety regulations. Although they adhere to performance requirements, they lack certain markings identifying their use, increasing the risk of the tires being used in improper ways, and increasing the risk of a crash. They were manufactured between June 2 and June 22, 2024, and sold through Costco's automotive department.

Anker Powercore 1000 Power Bank (Costco Next)

These power banks were also part of Anker's nationwide recall over the risk of fire or explosion from the lithium-ion battery within them.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

These dumbbells are under a voluntary recall because the plates that add weight to them may get dislodged from the handle while being used, causing a safety hazard.

Midea U-Shape Window AC's (Item #'s 1572673, 1657921, 1677429, 1768985, 2677450, and 2677429)

These window-mounted AC units are also being recalled for mold, with the manufacturer warning that pooling water may fail to drain. Mold can cause respiratory issues or lead to infection, especially in the young or elderly.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18pk - Select Lot Code - Select Locations in Texas and Louisiana (Item #1439351)

Between May 20 and May 29, 2025, Costco sold Topo Chico Mineral Water at a number of locations in Texas and Louisiana. The recall was issued because the water may be contaminated with pseudomonas, a bacteria that is naturally found in some mineral waters. While the bacteria poses little health risk for healthy individuals, it could cause problems for those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler (Item #1356922)

Costco is also warning customers about Igloo ice coolers as part of a nationwide recall, after numerous reports of the tow handles on the coolers pinching fingers while being used, sometimes causing amputation.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer (Item #2297950 and #3297950)

A number of Ninja-brand pressure cookers have been recalled after being sold at retailers across the U.S., including Costco, because they may cause severe burns. The recall was issued after reports that the lid on the device could be opened while the contents of the cooker were pressurized, causing severe burns and injuries from the hot contents. The pressure cookers were sold between May 2019 and May 2021.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/CCT/images/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022/20250603T195933/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:51.054045

Starbucks has rolled out a new layered line of Frappuccino drinks for which the iced, blended beverages are topped with the coffeehouse chain’s signature cold foam.

The new Strato line of beverages, named for the Italian word for “layer,” is now available nationwide.

Although baristas could always add cold foam, made with flavored, aerated skim milk, to beverages upon request (at least since the cold foam was introduced in 2018), they can now be ordered that way via the chain’s app.

They’re available in three flavors, each priced at around $5.95 for a medium “Grande”:

Brown Sugar Strato Frappuccino: Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with brown sugar cold foam and a dusting of cinnamon powder

Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino: Simple syrup and matcha powder blended with ice and whole milk topped with strawberry cold foam

Salted Caramel Mocha Strato Frappuccino: Mocha sauce and Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with salted caramel cold foam and a caramel syrup drizzle

These particular iterations of the Strato platform will be available while supplies last this summer, with new iterations likely to be introduced later in the year.

The first Strato Frappuccino was actually introduced last week, although it wasn’t called by that name, and was only available for that week.

The Firework Frappuccino used the chain’s Summer Berry Refresher as its base, blended with coconut milk, poured over raspberry-flavored popping pearls, swirled with strawberry purée and topped with vanilla cold foam. A Starbucks barista commenting on a TikTok post about the week-long special said that, while people seemed to enjoy it, “I hate making these,” because they require 13 steps.

Layered drinks such as the Strato offer texture and temperature contrasts that appear to appeal to younger consumers. Their color variations also play well on social media.

Earlier this year, Starbucks removed nine Frappuccino drinks from its regular menu as part of a planned 30% menu reduction, but it teased the Strato line during a June convention of Starbucks managers in Las Vegas, among other new food and beverage offerings, including a dark 1971 Roast, named for the year the chain was founded, that is slated to debut this winter, as well as the return of raspberry sauce, updated croissants, and a new cold foam with 15 grams of protein.

CVS DOWNFALL

CVS has confirmed that it will be shutting down 271 locations in 2025.

The struggling pharmacy chain has shut 900 spots over the past three years.

Between 2022 and 2024, CVS wiped out the 900 locations from its nationwide footprint.

The full list of the 271 CVS locations has not yet been released, but local news sources and Newsweek have locked in on about 39 spread across 17 states and Washington DC so far.

A spokesperson for the company said: ""We're focused on ensuring we have the right kinds of stores and the right number of stores in the right locations.

""We're closing locations strategically to better meet consumers'

""At the same time, big rivals like Walgreens health, wellness, and pharmacy care needs — as announced more than three years ago —not in reaction to industry pressures.""

During this, CVS has also pledged to lower prices on prescriptions, amid its many closures.

CEO David Joyner said: ""These entities remain the only part of the drug supply chain entirely focused on lowering costs.

""For more than three decades, PBMs have been a proven unequivocal mechanism to negotiate down the price of drugs for payers and consumers while promoting better adherence and better health.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/newspress-collage-52bm6nxtm-1751997828356.jpg?1751983447&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:36.844608

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has taken a measured approach to AI implementation, keeping client experience, cost, and use case at the core of every project. In an interaction with TOI before the WNS deal was announced, he said India remains a strategic hub for Capgemini, which currently has 175,000 employees in the country and is planning a gross addition of 45,000 this year. Ezzat said that GenAI and Agentic AI represented more than 6% of its bookings in the March quarter. The group has forecast revenue growth of -2% to 2% in constant currency for the 2025 financial year.

To what extent has GenAI influenced your internal software development?

It had some impact—especially when it comes to generating new code, where it performs reasonably well. However, even in those cases, the output still requires review, debugging, and thorough testing. So, while there are productivity gains, they’re not as significant as many people assume. When working with existing codebases or complex environments, the benefits are more limited. We’ve used GenAI for enhancements, for example, but the productivity improvements weren’t as dramatic as some might expect. There’s also a common misconception: increased productivity doesn’t automatically translate to cost savings. For instance, a 30% productivity gain among lower-cost roles like testers doesn’t have the same financial impact as a similar gain in higher-cost roles such as project managers or functional analysts. That nuance often gets overlooked. Beyond productivity, we’re equally focused on quality—delivering faster, but with better, more reliable code. So it's not just about cutting costs; multiple factors are driving our approach.

There are discussions around cost overruns with AI implementations. While productivity gains are evident, the operational costs of running AI remain a challenge.

We halted one client’s chatbot project—it was going to cost $25 million per year due to data consumption. The financial return just wasn’t there. AI solutions need to be evaluated case-by-case. Not all implementations yield a positive ROI. That said, in many situations, we can find reasonable returns, whether from speed, quality, or other value drivers.

From a broader perspective—on a recent investor call, you mentioned a subdued demand environment. Has anything shifted since then?

Demand remained steady over the past few months. Some industries are seeing growth, while others continue to face pressure. Overall, it’s a flat environment. We’re not seeing a sharp uptick in activity, but there also haven’t been significant cutbacks due to tariffs or other factors. What remains consistent is the focus on efficiency—cost reduction, productivity gains, and operational optimisation—rather than growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook and muted growth, companies are prioritising savings over innovation. Most large-scale transformations today are centred around cost optimisation, supply chain improvements, and boosting productivity. When it comes to efficiency and cost focus, there's no major difference. But in AI adoption—the US typically moves faster and is more aggressive. American companies are often quick to embrace new tech to stay ahead, while European firms tend to be more measured and cautious. That said, it still varies by company, so it's hard to generalise too much.

There’s growing momentum around GCCs in India. What's Capgemini's playbook?

It’s a natural shift. Clients want more control over key talent areas like tech and shared services, and GCCs offer that. India is a major talent hub, and many clients rely on us to set up, scale, and manage their local operations. We see it as a partnership—GCCs don’t replace us; we continue to support clients even after the setup. That’s the good news—there’s broad recognition that part of global operations, including proprietary work, will be based in India. It shows how Indian talent is important for in-house roles, and that’s a positive shift for both India and firms looking at global partnerships.

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News. The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse a sales slump, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers. In June, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities, Kennedy said in a post on X.

Starbucks’ U.S. menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, Gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks didn’t provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu. The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for nondairy milk and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavor.

The chain’s latest U.S. beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.
There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.
Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.
WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.","LONDON: Two big industry names tipped as potential candidates to be the next chief executive of WPP are not in the running for the job.

Campaign understands that Matt Brittin, former EMEA president of Google, and David Droga, outgoing chief executive of Accenture Song, are not involved in the agency holding company's recruitment process. (Campaign is PRWeek's sister business media outlet at Haymarket Media).

WPP has given no update on its search since June 9, when the British agency group said Mark Read, chief executive since 2018, is planning to step down but will remain in the job until December 31, when he will retire from the board.

However, multiple sources said they believe WPP’s board, which is led by Philip Jansen, chair, is set make a decision soon. An appointment will come “sooner than expected,"" one person said.

When WPP last looked for a CEO in 2018, after Martin Sorrell abruptly exited, the search took four and a half months, but Read was widely seen as the internal favorite from the start of the process – unlike in 2025 when no frontrunner has yet emerged.

There have been rumours in industry circles since March that WPP has made overtures to Brittin, but it is understood he is not looking for an executive board role in the near term, after leaving Google this summer.

Brittin previously said in a LinkedIn post when he first announced his departure that he wanted to “take a break for the first time since leaving school – a ‘mini gap year’” – and he was looking forward to spending more time with his family “in the year ahead.""

Droga’s decision to step down as chief executive of Accenture Song in May and move to a new role as vice chair of parent company Accenture also fueled speculation that WPP has approached the Droga5 founder. However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.

Other external industry names who have been linked with the vacancy include Lord Carter, chief executive of Informa, the owner of Cannes Lions, who worked at WPP early in his career. Informa did not comment. A source said analysts would be surprised if Carter were to make a move given his expansion plans for Informa.

There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.

WPP declined to comment on the process.

Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.

Speaking at his first WPP annual shareholder meeting in May, Jansen told investors that the board was under no obligation to make immediate changes, but the nominations committee “continually takes a long-term view on board succession planning."" Read’s departure was announced a little over two weeks later.

WPP has been under pressure as it faces a third year of lackluster revenue growth, with a decline of between zero and 2% expected in 2025. It has lost some major media accounts, including Coca-Cola in North America and Mars globally, to Publicis Groupe.

WPP’s share price has fallen 37% since the start of 2025, reducing its stock market valuation from £8.9 billion to £5.6 billion.

Analysts at Barclays warned in a note last month that they expect WPP’s “underperformance to continue” in the short term, partly “because of the uncertainties created by a change in management.""

“On average, media stocks that have seen a change in management underperform by 10% between the announcement of a change in CEO and the strategy of the new CEO being unveiled,” Barclays said.

The investment bank added that “we do not believe, unlike others, that WPP is fundamentally impaired and we do believe that the new CEO can turn this ship around, but it is likely to come with higher investments and lower margins initially.""

WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.

""Their holistic approach to digital and clinical transformation focuses on improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare efficiency. We appreciate their commitment to driving meaningful impact across the entire care journey with generative AI, while preserving the human touch of clinicians and the integrity of healthcare operations.""

THE LARGER TREND

In June, Hippocratic AI and Universal Health Services (UHS) announced that genAI agents, which support clinicians by making phone follow-up outreach to patients after discharge, were deployed in two UHS subsidiaries: Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas and Texoma Medical Center in Denison, Texas.

The initiative aims to support clinicians in continuing to monitor their patients after discharge from the hospital, detecting and alerting UHS clinical staff to changes in patient conditions and addressing patients' questions.

In May, Hippocratic AI partnered with Eucalia, a clinical operations company, to launch the first Japanese-language genAI healthcare agent for non-diagnostic, patient-facing clinical tasks. The partnership marked Hippocratic AI's entry into the Japanese market.

Scheduled to be introduced this year, the Japanese generative AI healthcare agent aims to support clinicians by taking on time-consuming but important non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks, including appointment scheduling, follow-up outreach, chronic care check-ins and medication adherence support.

In April, Hippocratic AI partnered with Burjeel Holdings, a healthcare services provider based in the United Arab Emirates. Burjeel Holdings operates in parts of the Middle East and North Africa.

Through the alliance, Hippocratic AI's agents will be developed for ""patient-facing non-diagnostic clinical tasks,"" distributed across Burjeel Holdings' healthcare facilities and physiotherapy clinics in the UAE and Oman.

In January, Hippocratic AI closed a $141 million Series B round of funding, bringing its valuation to $1.64 billion.

As reciprocal restrictions disrupt traditional trade routes, investors are poised to capitalize on strategic arbitrage opportunities through cross-border mergers & acquisitions (M&A) and regional production diversification. This article outlines how companies are reconfiguring their supply chains—and which stocks to buy, avoid, or short—to profit from—or mitigate—the fallout.

The Trade War in Context: Reciprocal Barriers and Market Fragmentation

Since June 2025, the EU has banned Chinese medical device firms from bidding on public contracts exceeding €5 million, while capping Chinese component usage at 50%. In retaliation, China excluded EU-based companies from tenders above 45 million yuan ($6.3 million). These measures, rooted in accusations of unfair trade practices (e.g., China's “Made in China 2025” localization mandates), have split the $500 billion global medtech market into two walled gardens.

The stakes are high: China's medtech exports to the EU totaled €11.4 billion in 2024, while EU firms face exclusion from 87% of China's public tenders. Companies unable to adapt risk losing access to critical markets, while agile players can dominate niche segments.

Strategic Responses: M&A and Regional Diversification

1. European Firms Acquiring Chinese Partners

To bypass China's procurement bans, EU medtech companies are partnering with or acquiring local Chinese firms to qualify for domestic tenders. Philips (NYSE: PHG) exemplifies this strategy: 90% of its Chinese sales are generated through local manufacturing, shielding it from exclusion. Similarly, Siemens Healthineers (OTCPK: SHLGY) leverages its 15%-revenue-generating China business to navigate restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Back firms with localized production in China, such as Philips or Becton Dickinson (NYSE: BDX), which already sources 70% of its Chinese devices domestically. These companies benefit from dual access: EU procurement (via non-Chinese components) and China's fast-growing market.

2. Shifting Production to ASEAN

The EU's restrictions have spurred a rush to ASEAN, where countries like Thailand and Malaysia offer cost-effective, geopolitically neutral manufacturing hubs. Stryker (NYSE: SYK) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) are expanding production in Vietnam and Indonesia to avoid reliance on China. This strategy not only circumvents trade barriers but also taps into ASEAN's $35 billion medtech market.

Investment Opportunity: Invest in firms with flexible supply chains and ASEAN exposure, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) or Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), whose robotic surgery systems are in high demand across fragmented markets.

3. Chinese Firms Seeking EU Assets

While the research highlights limited Chinese acquisitions of EU assets to date, the potential remains. Chinese firms like Mindray Medical (SZSE: 300760) or United Imaging could target EU-based R&D firms or niche manufacturers to gain access to EU procurement tenders. Such deals would allow them to rebrand as “European” entities and bypass the IPI's restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Monitor state-backed Chinese firms with strong balance sheets, such as Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), for opportunistic EU acquisitions.

Risks and Short Candidates

The trade war's escalation carries significant risks:

- Geopolitical Volatility: Escalating tariffs or WTO disputes could disrupt supply chains further.

- Overcapacity in ASEAN: Rapid manufacturing shifts may lead to oversupply and margin compression.

Avoid or Short:

- Pure-play exporters to China/EU, such as Smiths Group (LSE: SMIN) or Getinge (OMX: GETI), which lack localized production.

- Companies reliant on high-Chinese-component exports, such as Teleflex (NYSE: TLS), whose EU sales could collapse under the 50% threshold rule.

Conclusion: Bet on Flexibility and Diversification

The EU-China medtech trade war is a zero-sum game for traditional players but a goldmine for firms willing to reconfigure their supply chains. Investors should prioritize companies with localized manufacturing in China, ASEAN production hubs, or cross-border joint ventures. Meanwhile, shorting firms stuck in the trade crossfire offers asymmetric risk-reward. As the world's two largest medtech markets fracture, the winners will be those who master the art of arbitrage in this new reality.

Final Note: Monitor the EU-China summit in late July 2025 for de-escalation signals. If talks fail, expect accelerated M&A activity and deeper supply chain reconfiguration—a scenario favoring the strategies outlined above.",,N,,2025-07-08 18:05:32.627092

Intel and HP have co-engineered a new class of AI PCs that run AI workloads locally for enhanced speed and privacy. The collaboration delivers up to 223% faster performance on key business apps, enabling measurable productivity gains.

What is Covered in this Article:

Intel and HP co-engineered AI PCs for business users, including the EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra, and EliteBook 8, powered by Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors.

Intel optimized CPU, GPU, and NPU resources across 12 configurations and 8 AI PC models, validating performance on key enterprise applications.

AI apps like Power BI, Tableau, and Canvid showed performance gains of up to 223% versus prior-gen systems, with first-time Windows availability for Canvid and Writeup.

Intel’s hands-on involvement extended to benchmarking 9 AI-enhanced applications for HP’s go-to-market execution.

Despite macro uncertainty in PC demand, the collaboration showcases tangible improvements in business productivity from local AI capabilities.

The News: HP and Intel have teamed up to launch a new lineup of AI-powered PCs built for business use, including the EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra, and EliteBook 8. These devices are designed with a focus on productivity and privacy and run on Intel’s Core Ultra 200V processors. Both companies worked together on the hardware and software to ensure these machines could handle AI tasks locally, using the CPU, GPU, and NPU.

Over eight months, Intel and HP tested a dozen hardware setups across eight different AI PC models. This effort helped fine-tune nine AI-focused apps – like Power BI, Tableau, Adobe Lightroom, Canvid, and Writeup—with noticeable performance boosts over older systems.

Can Intel and HP Finally Make AI PCs a Must-Have for Business?

Analyst Take: The HP-Intel partnership on these AI PCs is a strong, data-backed push to shift business computing toward on-device AI. With 62% of enterprise IT leaders adopting AI PCs to futureproof their organizations, this launch gives the segment much-needed credibility backed by purpose-driven investment. The detailed performance data and use-case testing give HP a strong story to tell enterprise buyers while also helping Intel stay competitive against AMD and Qualcomm, who are rolling out their AI-focused chips.

Performance Improvements Backed by Data

Unlike some AI PC rollouts that have featured vague performance promises, HP and Intel are backing these with solid numbers. Compared to previous systems, Power BI saw up to 45% speed improvements, Tableau was 48% faster, and Adobe Lightroom ran 32% quicker. Canvid, the screen recording tool, was also up to 223% faster. Similarly, the local AI writing tool Writeup hit 165% better output speeds. These results came from over 500 hours of benchmarking by Intel’s software team, focused on real business tasks and not artificial tests. These real numbers give HP more concrete productivity and resource usage pitches to companies looking for clear value before upgrading their PCs and for guidance on which AI PCs to choose.

Intel’s Engineering Push Shows a Strategic Shift

Part of the reason for these improvements is that Intel did not just provide the chips. The company also helped optimize software for them: Engineers from Intel’s Client Computing Group worked hand-in-hand with HP’s commercial PC team to tune performance across CPU, GPU, and NPU, reflecting Intel’s more rounded approach to AI workload resource management in their PC systems. Unlike Qualcomm, which has so far prioritized energy-efficient NPUs for AI workloads, Intel has taken a less NPU-centric approach with a more balanced total system performance between NPU and GPU – a potentially less power-efficient but more flexible system design strategy.

By focusing on key AI apps that business users rely on and ensuring they run well locally, Intel is also carving out a space for itself against ARM-based rivals like Apple, who still lean more on cloud computing than on-device capabilities.

While this kind of collaboration between device OEMs and chipmakers isn’t unusual, the deep focus on how partnerships like this could drive more explicit differentiation between platforms and PC brands could become the new normal for silicon and PC OEM partnerships. (We saw a similar effort between Intel and Lenovo last year with Lenovo’s Aura Edition PCs.) Broadly, Intel’s move toward working with PC OEMs to build systems for specific workloads and help optimize PCs for critical use cases, especially in the commercial segment, suggests that Intel understands that it can’t just put out parts for PCs anymore and expect orders to roll in – even in the Enterprise. The introduction of AI PCs has changed the dynamics of the PC market about as much as the arrival of Windows-on-Arm systems, and Intel understands that to hold on to its slipping market share, it needs to give PC buyers – consumers, in the SMB space, and the Enterprise – a reason not to select another platform.

For HP, the equation is somewhat similar: If Intel is pursuing deep partnerships with other PC OEMs to deliver uniquely tuned AI PCs for critical user categories, HP needs to do the same. This announcement signals that HP is in Intel’s inner circle and that it has uniquely optimized PCs to offer discerning customers with specific performance demands.

On-Device AI Boosts Privacy and Builds Trust

Running LLMs and productivity tools locally can make systems faster and more responsive and also frees users from the constraints of cloud services, connectivity limitations, and bandwidth challenges. An additional advantage is that running workloads locally is also more secure, as data being processed locally is easier to protect from interception and snooping. Two of the most important advantages of AI PCs are that they boost data privacy and security. And while still under-indexed, these privacy and performance benefits could help drive adoption in areas like finance, government, and healthcare, where trust is critical and data security rules are more stringent.

The challenge for now is that many of today’s most important productivity tools are still cloud-based, making AI PCs (particularly Copilot+ PCs) far too reliant on cloud-based AI processing than they need to be. In short, the hardware is ready, but many software platforms remain, with their AI workloads primarily cloud and subscription-based. This doesn’t mean organizations shouldn’t buy AI PCs now as part of their PC refresh schedule. What it does mean, however, is that the security and productivity gains promised by AI PCs may not fully materialize for some time yet.

AI PCs Still Early in the Game

While Intel’s Core Ultra chips offer solid local performance, many companies are waiting for the Panther Lake processor refresh (late 2025) and the Nova Lake processor (2026), which promise considerable performance improvements (50-80 Trillion Operations Per Second / TOPS on the NPU, with total system TOPS reaching for the 200 range). Again, these performance improvements are mostly academic at this point, since most AI-intensive applications continue to be cloud-based by default. That being said, when we start seeing some of these AI workloads truly shift to being handled on-device, these systems will be ready to deliver.

The current gap between system capabilities and what is operationally possible at the moment is the primary reason why demand for AI PCs from commercial PC buyers hasn’t been more aggressive. But this HP-Intel effort makes a solid case for these systems, especially for companies thinking about buying PCs that will be AI-ready when critical AI-accelerated productivity software starts to expand from the cloud to devices.

With over 500 hours of joint testing, HP has a data-backed case to make as one of the first movers in this space – helping shift AI PCs from theory to practice.

What to Watch:

HP’s success hinges on translating benchmarking gains into repeatable outcomes across a wider portfolio of enterprise workflows.

Intel’s momentum in this space could be challenged by AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 Series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform, both of which are gaining OEM traction.

Enterprise customers may wait for higher TOPS performance from the upcoming Nova Lake and Panther Lake processors before scaling AI PC deployments.

The real-world gains showcased in HP’s testing will need to extend beyond launch partners to convince the broader enterprise market.

What is the new Spicy McMuffin from McDonald’s?

The Spicy McMuffin is McDonald’s latest offering to add heat to its morning lineup. The product maintains the core ingredients of the Egg McMuffin — an English muffin, egg, and cheese — but elevates the experience with a peppery hot sauce, perfect for those who like to kick off the day with bold flavor. It will also be available as a Spicy Sausage McMuffin and a Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

This isn’t McDonald’s first time flirting with heat. The brand previously won praise for its Spicy Chicken McNuggets, a limited-time item that became an instant hit. Now, McDonald’s continues its tradition of bold innovation, embracing spicy options that satisfy adventurous palates.

Snack Wrap: The Comeback Fans Never Gave Up On

The return of the Snack Wrap has generated genuine excitement among American customers. It’s a product that disappeared from the national menu in 2016 but never left the hearts of fans. Over the years, social media was flooded with nostalgic posts, memes, and even formal petitions begging McDonald’s to bring it back.

Now, finally, the Snack Wrap is back — and this time, it’s a permanent menu item. It features one of the brand-new McCrispy Strips, juicy all-white meat chicken, combined with shredded lettuce, cheese, and sauce, all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.

Consumers can choose between two flavors:

Spicy Snack Wrap – with a habanero-inspired kick straight from the popular Spicy McCrispy sandwich.

Ranch Snack Wrap – with creamy garlic and onion notes that bring out that classic ranch flavor.

To make things even better, the Snack Wrap will be available à la carte or as part of a combo meal, including two Snack Wraps, medium fries, and a drink — all starting at just $2.99 USD.

McDonald’s openly acknowledged that consumer demand made the difference. In the company’s words: “They’re the ones who inspired us to make its return to the menu happen.” This initiative is part of McDonald’s broader effort to strengthen emotional connections with customers and respond more directly to their preferences.

McDonald’s by the Numbers: A Global Powerhouse

According to data from Statista, McDonald’s generated $25.92 billion USD in global revenue in 2024, with franchise restaurant sales reaching $120.93 billion. In its largest market, the United States, the company surpassed $10.4 billion in revenue that same year.

The company also continues to invest in its brand. In 2024, McDonald’s allocated $445 million USD to global advertising, and reported over 175 million active users in its loyalty program.

Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility.","Mondelez International's voluntary recall of specific RITZ Peanut Butter Cracker Sandwich products in July 2025—a precautionary move to address mislabeling risks for peanut allergy sufferers—has reignited debates about the snack giant's operational resilience and brand trustworthiness. While the recall itself is narrow in scope, its implications for supply chain management, consumer safety, and financial performance warrant scrutiny. For investors, the question is clear: Does this incident underscore Mondelez's agility in managing risks, or does it expose vulnerabilities that could undermine its long-term growth?

The Recall: A Contained Risk, but a Strategic Litmus Test

The recall, affecting only select carton sizes (8-, 20-, and 40-packs of peanut butter crackers and a variety pack) with “Best When Used By” dates between November 2025 and January 2026, stemmed from a supplier error in film packaging rolls. This defect could have led to peanut butter-filled crackers being labeled as cheese varieties, posing a severe risk to allergy-sensitive consumers. While no injuries were reported, the recall underscores the criticality of supplier quality control in Mondelez's global supply chain.

Mondelez's swift response—issuing a voluntary recall, establishing a 24/7 consumer hotline, and collaborating with the FDA—demonstrates a commitment to consumer safety. However, the incident raises questions about oversight of third-party suppliers, particularly in high-risk areas like allergen labeling. For a company whose brand equity relies heavily on trust (think Oreo, Cadbury, and belVita), such lapses could erode confidence among vulnerable customer segments.

Financial Performance: The Recall's Minimal Impact, but Bigger Storms Loom

The recall's financial consequences appear negligible. Analysts estimate the affected products represent a tiny fraction of Mondelez's $36.4 billion 2024 revenue, and the company has not disclosed recall-related costs in its Q1 2025 results. Instead, the quarter's struggles—organic revenue growth of 3.1% versus a 3.5% expectation, and a 23% year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS to $0.74—were driven by macroeconomic headwinds like cocoa cost inflation (up 70% year-on-year) and unfavorable currency impacts.

Mondelez's margin pressures are systemic, not recall-induced. Gross margins fell to 26.1% in Q1 2025, down 2,500 basis points year-on-year, as cocoa prices and transportation costs surged. The company is countering these challenges with pricing strategies (net pricing contributed 3.1% to organic revenue growth) and cost-cutting, including savings from its “Simplify to Grow” program. While the recall's impact is muted, investors must assess whether Mondelez can navigate broader inflationary pressures and sustain its 2025 outlook of a 10% adjusted EPS decline.

Analyst Optimism vs. Operational Realities: Where Does the Stock Stand?

Despite Q1's misses, analysts remain cautiously bullish. Institutions like BofA Securities and Stifel have raised price targets, citing Mondelez's ability to outperform consensus EPS estimates even amid margin contraction. The stock's beta of 0.49 signals lower volatility than the broader market, and its 19.7% six-month price return reflects investor confidence in its defensive snack business.

However, risks persist. Cocoa prices—Mondelez's largest raw material cost—remain volatile, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war) could further disrupt supply chains. The recall, while minor, highlights the need for Mondelez to invest in supplier audits and digital traceability systems to prevent future incidents.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, but Mind the Risks

Mondelez's stock (MDLZ) currently trades at 21.5x 2025 adjusted EPS estimates, a discount to its five-year average P/E of 24.3. With a 2.3% dividend yield and a history of shareholder returns ($2.1 billion in buybacks and dividends in Q1 alone), the stock offers defensive appeal.

Buy Signal:

- The recall's limited scope and proactive management suggest Mondelez's brand trust is intact.

- Analysts' upward revisions and the company's reaffirmed 2025 guidance reflect confidence in its cost-saving and pricing strategies.

Hold or Sell Signal:

- Cocoa inflation and margin pressures remain unresolved. If input costs persist beyond 2025, growth could stall.

- A repeat of supply chain errors, especially involving safety-critical issues, could damage brand equity.

Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle

Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility. While the incident underscores the importance of supplier oversight, the company's swift action and broader financial resilience suggest it can weather this storm. For investors, the stock presents a compelling entry point—if they're willing to bet on Mondelez's ability to navigate inflation and maintain its premium snack market dominance.",,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:49.767448

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger.
- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.
However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.
- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.","The $949 million legal judgment against CVS Health for its subsidiary Omnicare's fraudulent prescription practices marks a seismic moment for the healthcare sector. This ruling, which could ultimately cost CVS over $400 million in penalties and treble damages, exposes systemic governance failures and compliance risks that investors must now factor into their valuation of healthcare giants. For CVS, the verdict is not just a liability on its balance sheet—it's a stark warning about the consequences of merging under regulatory scrutiny and failing to address legacy liabilities.

The Legal Judgment: A Blueprint for Corporate Accountability

In April 2025, a federal jury found Omnicare liable for dispensing medications to elderly patients in long-term care facilities without valid prescriptions, resulting in over 3 million false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The damages of $135.6 million could triple under the False Claims Act (FCA), while penalties of up to $28,619 per claim could push total costs toward $949 million. Critically, the jury held CVS liable as the parent company for “causing” these violations by failing to address compliance gaps it knew about for years.

CVS's defense—that state laws permitted the practices and that it lacked direct control—was rejected. The court emphasized that as a holding company, CVS was obligated to enforce compliance under a 2016 Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), which required oversight of Omnicare's operations. This ruling underscores a seismic shift: parent companies can no longer shield themselves from subsidiary misconduct under federal programs.

Regulatory Gaps and Governance Failures

The case reveals two critical governance flaws at CVS:

1. Lax Oversight Post-Acquisition: CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015, but internal audits and compliance reviews from 2016–2018 identified systemic issues, including “roll-over” prescriptions (assigning new prescription numbers to expired ones). Despite these findings, CVS did not mandate corrective actions, violating its CIA obligations.

2. Strategic Ambiguity: In 2022, CVS briefly explored selling Omnicare, recognizing its non-strategic value, but reversed course in 2023. This indecision suggests a lack of clarity about Omnicare's risks versus rewards—a red flag for investors in a sector where regulatory missteps can metastasize.

The Omnicare case also highlights broader industry risks. The jury's focus on “speaker programs” and kickbacks (echoed in a parallel Gilead Sciences settlement) signals that the DOJ is targeting financial incentives influencing prescribing practices—a trend that could expose other healthcare firms to similar liabilities.

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations

The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger. CVS faces:

- Penalties and Litigation Costs: Beyond the $949 million estimate, ongoing appeals and settlements could drain cash reserves.

- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.

- Future Liabilities: Other subsidiaries or acquisitions may harbor similar risks, creating a “liability time bomb” for investors.

For investors, this demands a reevaluation of CVS's valuation multiples. The company trades at a P/E ratio of 12.5x, slightly above peers like UnitedHealth (11.8x) and Humana (14.2x). However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.

Investment Implications: Scrutinize Balance Sheet Resilience

Investors must ask two questions:

1. Can CVS absorb this hit without diluting shareholder value? Its $13 billion cash balance and $5 billion in annual free cash flow may cushion the blow, but sustained legal costs could strain its dividend (currently yielding 1.8%).

2. Is management accountable? CEO Karen S. Lynch has emphasized “operational discipline,” but the Omnicare verdict suggests governance gaps persist.

Actionable advice:

- Underweight CVS until management demonstrates a clear plan to address compliance risks and legacy liabilities.

- Compare to peers: Firms like AmerisourceBergen (ABC) or Cardinal Health (CAH), which face fewer regulatory headwinds, may offer safer exposure to healthcare distribution.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.

Conclusion: A New Era of Accountability

The Omnicare judgment is a watershed moment for healthcare giants. It signals that regulators and juries will hold parent companies directly responsible for subsidiary misconduct—a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences. Investors must now treat corporate governance and compliance rigor as core valuation metrics, not afterthoughts. For CVS, the path to recovery hinges on transparency, proactive risk management, and a willingness to divest businesses with unsustainable liabilities. Until then, the stock remains a cautionary tale of how governance failures can unravel even the largest healthcare empires.

Final note: This case is not isolated. Investors should pressure all healthcare firms to disclose compliance frameworks and legacy risks, lest they face similar reckoning.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:40.141400

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages, in a whistleblower lawsuit claiming it fraudulently billed the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.

In a Monday evening order, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018.

McMahon also awarded $406.8 million of damages, representing three times the $135.6 million that a jury awarded on April 29.

The tripling was required under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

CVS plans to appeal the judgment. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager bought Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare has asked McMahon to throw out the case or grant a new trial.

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" CVS said in a statement on Tuesday. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed.""

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Uri Bassan, a former Omnicare pharmacist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined by the federal government in 2019.

They said Omnicare improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for prescriptions for tens of thousands of patients in assisted-living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.

Omnicare allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

McMahon rejected CVS' argument that a $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.

""This was a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct,"" the judge wrote.

McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying that company. CVS itself did not submit any claims.

The case is U.S. ex rel Bassan v. Omnicare Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-04179.

U.S. tariffs could pressure costs, though Levi’s management anticipates only a minimal impact on Q2 margins and is considering selective price increases. Organic revenue is expected to grow 3.5%–4.5% in Q2, with gross margin expanding by 80–100 basis points. For the full year, revenue is projected to decline by 1%–2% (excluding tariff effects), while gross margin is expected to rise by roughly 100 basis points to 61.6%.

The company has $7.8 Bil in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $6.3 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $647 Mil in operating profits and net income of $356 Mil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader.

There are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself before the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

Levi’s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return

There are 17 earnings data points recorded over the last five years, with 9 positive and 8 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 53% of the time.

However, this percentage decreases to 33% if we consider data for the last 3 years instead of 5.

Median of the 9 positive returns = 4.2%, and median of the 8 negative returns = -7.7%

Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns

A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector.","Court Order Signals Escalating Battle Over E-Commerce Giant's Market Power

The Competition Bureau of Canada has secured a Federal Court order compelling Amazon to turn over internal records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, marking a significant escalation in the regulator's investigation into potential abuse of dominance by the e-commerce giant.

The court order, announced Tuesday, advances a probe examining whether Amazon's pricing policies effectively suppress competition and inflate prices for Canadian consumers. The investigation focuses specifically on rules that allow Amazon to penalize third-party sellers who offer lower prices on competing platforms.

""This is a watershed moment for Canadian antitrust enforcement,"" said a competition policy expert familiar with the case. ""It's the first major deployment of the Bureau's expanded investigative powers under the amended Competition Act, and signals a new willingness to confront dominant digital platforms.""

Inside Amazon's Pricing Vise

At the heart of the investigation is Amazon's Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, implemented in 2017, which gives the company broad authority to suppress listings or remove the coveted ""Buy Box"" from sellers whose products are priced lower elsewhere online.

While Amazon frames the policy as consumer protection against price gouging, critics view it as a sophisticated mechanism to cement market dominance. When sellers cannot offer better deals on competing platforms without risking visibility on Amazon—where many generate the bulk of their revenue—rival marketplaces struggle to gain traction.

The timing aligns with sweeping changes to Canada's competition regime. Recent amendments dramatically increased potential penalties for abuse of dominance to the greater of C$25 million, three times the ill-gotten gains, or an eye-watering 3% of global annual revenue—which for Amazon could theoretically reach US$19 billion based on 2024 figures.

""The Competition Bureau is finally showing its teeth,"" remarked an industry analyst who requested anonymity. ""With the new penalty ceiling tied to global revenue rather than just Canadian operations, the stakes have fundamentally changed for multinational platforms.""

Policy Battlefield: Protection or Predation?

Amazon's fair pricing rules create a complex economic calculus for the thousands of Canadian businesses selling through its platform.

""Many sellers feel trapped in a paradox,"" explained a consultant who advises e-commerce businesses. ""Amazon's policy nominally promotes price consistency, but effectively functions as a most-favored-nation clause that prevents price competition across platforms.""

For consumers, the implications cut both ways. While Amazon's dominant position—estimated at 40% of Canada's US$66 billion e-commerce market—has delivered convenience and seemingly competitive prices, the Bureau is examining whether those prices could be artificially inflated by restricted competition.

The investigation presents Amazon with a delicate balancing act. The company must defend policies it considers fundamental to marketplace integrity while navigating an increasingly hostile regulatory landscape. Amazon has not yet commented on the court order, though the Bureau emphasized no conclusion of wrongdoing has been reached.

Trade Tensions Cast Long Shadow

The investigation unfolds against a backdrop of escalating U.S.-Canada trade frictions, particularly regarding Canada's Digital Services Tax that primarily affects American tech giants. With former President Trump returning to office and renewing tariff threats, the Amazon probe takes on additional geopolitical significance.

""There's undeniably a political dimension to this timing,"" observed a trade policy specialist. ""Canadian regulators are asserting sovereignty over their digital economy while facing pressure from Washington to tread carefully with American companies.""

This dynamic creates unusual investment considerations, as regulatory outcomes could be influenced by diplomatic calculations beyond the traditional antitrust framework.

Market Impact: Beyond the Headline Risk

For investors, the investigation presents both immediate concerns and longer-term strategic implications.

While the theoretical penalty ceiling is massive, precedent suggests a more modest outcome. ""The largest abuse-of-dominance administrative monetary penalty ever imposed in Canada is approximately C$100 million,"" noted a financial analyst specializing in regulatory risk. ""Even with political pressures, I'd handicap the cash impact between C$100-250 million, with an extreme scenario capped around C$1 billion.""

The more significant market impact may come from behavioral remedies rather than monetary penalties. If Amazon is forced to relax its pricing policy, the competitive landscape could shift substantially.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector. ""That benefits multi-channel enablers like Shopify and potentially creates openings for traditional retailers with strong online operations—Walmart Canada, Canadian Tire, and Costco could all see margin improvements.""

The Road Ahead: Inflection Point for Digital Regulation

The Competition Bureau's next steps will be closely watched. Amazon has 30 days to comply with the document production order unless it seeks judicial review. Should the Bureau proceed to file an application with the Competition Tribunal, the case would move from investigation to litigation.

Critically, as of June 20, 2025, private parties can now file civil abuse-of-dominance claims under recent amendments—opening the door for competitors or affected sellers to pursue their own cases against Amazon.

""This could become a perfect storm of regulatory pressure,"" warned a corporate governance advisor. ""Public enforcement combined with private litigation creates unprecedented uncertainty for Amazon's Canadian operations.""

Investment Outlook: Positioning for Regulatory Outcomes

For traders navigating this regulatory uncertainty, several strategic approaches merit consideration.

A pairs trade going long Shopify while shorting Amazon could capitalize on Canadian sellers diversifying their channel strategy. Traditional retailers with established e-commerce operations may see relief rallies if Amazon voluntarily relaxes its pricing policies to avoid protracted litigation.

Paradoxically, any significant stock price decline in Amazon specifically tied to Canadian regulatory headlines likely presents a buying opportunity, as the financial impact—even in worst-case scenarios—represents only a fraction of the company's global operations and cash flow.

""The market consistently overreacts to headline regulatory risk,"" suggested an institutional investor. ""Smart money will focus on the structural remedies rather than the theoretical maximum penalties.""

Investors should recognize that this case potentially marks a turning point in how digital platforms are regulated globally. Canadian precedents could influence ongoing investigations in the EU and U.S., creating regulatory contagion that ultimately reshapes the competitive dynamics of online marketplaces.

Investment Thesis

SectionKey PointsWhat Happened- On 8 July 2025, the Competition Bureau forced Amazon to disclose records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy (MFPP).

- The Bureau is investigating if MFPP allows Amazon to (i) raise fees/prices, (ii) block rivals, or (iii) both.

- No wrongdoing found yet—this is an evidence-gathering step.Legal Changes- Abuse of dominance penalties now capped at C$25M, 3× benefit, or 3% global revenue (vs. C$10M pre-2022).

- Private lawsuits allowed from 20 June 2025 (AMP + damages).

- Compulsory disclosure now applies to market studies (used here).Financial Exposure- Global sales (2024): US$638B; 3P seller services: US$156B.

- Estimated Canadian GMV: ~US$26B.

- Potential AMP cap: Up to US$19.1B (3% global sales) or US$3.9B (3× benefit).

- Realistic penalty estimate: C$100-250M (70% chance), up to C$1B in extreme cases.Probability-Weighted Outcomes- 30%: Co-operative remedy (<C$50M + policy tweaks).

- 40%: Moderate AMP (C$100-250M) + conduct changes.

- 20%: Litigated loss (C$1-5B + algorithmic changes).

- 10%: Structural remedy (split 1P/3P—unlikely but high impact).Strategic Impacts- Sellers: More pricing flexibility if MFPP weakens (benefits Shopify).

- Competitors: Walmart, Costco, Best Buy may regain share.

- Regulatory risk: Could influence EU/FTC cases.

- Political risk: Potential U.S. tariff retaliation.Investment Angles- Long SHOP / Short AMZN: If sellers diversify.

- Long Canadian retailers (CTC-A, WMT): If Amazon relaxes MFPP.

- Buy AMZN dip: If penalty <US$1B (minor earnings impact).Next Steps- Amazon’s 30-day deadline to comply or appeal.

- Bureau’s decision to escalate to litigation.

- Private lawsuits possible after 20 June 2025.

- FTC timeline (Q4 2025) may sync with Canada’s case.

- U.S. election (Nov 2025) could trigger tariff risks.Bottom Line- Market underestimates risk due to new penalty scale (global revenue-based) and private lawsuits.

- Likely outcome: Conduct remedy (not huge fines), but long-term impact on Amazon’s pricing power.

- Opportunity: Buy AMZN dips; Shopify and multi-channel sellers may benefit.

Dive Brief:

Starbucks is offering performance-based compensation awards for executives tied to the Back to Starbucks plans, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29.

The awards, which have a target value of $6 million, consist of a grant of performance-based restricted stock units that vest after fiscal year 2027.

Executives will receive the stock grants if the company meets cost-reduction goals, and leaders can earn twice the money if Starbucks hits additional goals related to “(i) the rollout of the Company’s Green Apron Service program, (ii) coffeehouse uplifts, (iii) new food and beverage platforms, and (iv) a reimagined Starbucks Rewards program,” according to the 8-K.

Dive Insight:

The stock awards show that among Starbucks’ key goals for the next two years, reducing costs is its highest priority. The additional goals are part of CEO Brian Niccol’s effort to renovate the brand and return its focus to the shopfloor.

The Green Apron Service model, for instance, “combines and unifies new service standards and expectations, changes to partner plays and deployment, streamlined routines, and our order sequencing algorithm,” Niccol said on the brand’s fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call.

Starbucks is in the middle of a transition toward an on-premise, coffeehouse focus. The early steps of that plan included the return of ceramic mugs for in-store orders, the restoration of the condiment coffee bar, improved seating, and handwritten notes on cups, according to the earnings call.

But going forward, Starbucks will renovate large numbers of cafes to meet new, warmer design standards. Niccol said on the earnings call that the chain was balancing the need for renovations with cost: “uplifts feel premium, but keep renovation costs down and minimize closure days.”

Starbucks also has cut a large number of menu items, but the new incentives signal the brand has a long-range strategy to use new menu items to draw in consumers. This menu strategy is likely to include coffee-forward beverages, in keeping with Niccol’s narrowed idea of the brand’s identity. The relatively new ristretto beverage platform is a good example of what a coffeehouse-focused menu innovation move might look like.

The changes to the rewards program, meanwhile, likely mean a shift away from aggressive discounting, given Niccol’s comments on the most recent earnings call. Starbucks, he said, had been discounting too much through its rewards program and was trying to build up transactions through the program that are not based on discounting.

Clarifying that the Capgemini merger does not reflect any immediate changes to the business process management (BPM) company’s global operations, Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO and a member of the Board of Directors of WNS, said the move seeks to address client demand for Agentic AI solutions.

“This transaction will address our global clients’ needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation, while achieving superior business outcomes,” Murugesh told businessline, adding that Capgemini and WNS will together create a leader in Intelligent Operations, a solution that helps organisations transform activities and processes from back to front office by leveraging intelligent automation, decision intelligence, backed by data, AI and technology.

Murugesh said this will uniquely position the companies to support organisations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms, to deep process and industry expertise.

When asked about workforce rationalisation, WNS said it maintains a strong presence in New York, London, and India, and is fully committed to all its markets.

“Our geographies are largely complementary to Capgemini’s. Until closing, which we expect to occur by the end of the year, Capgemini and WNS will continue to operate as independent companies. There are no immediate operational changes,” said Murugesh.

In the past, companies like Infosys have acquired BPM companies like Progeon Ltd to offer their clients a complete cost-effective solution based on service and technology outsourcing.

However, Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, pointed out that the Capgemini-WNS merger implies tighter coupling between AI engines and process delivery.

“This may benefit enterprises looking to embed GenAI across operations — invoice scanning, underwriting, agent assistance. But it could also mean less flexibility to run those processes independently or plug them into third-party clouds and AI systems,” said Gogia.

In sectors like insurance and utilities, where WNS has deep traction, platform gravity is especially strong. If Capgemini folds those vertical solutions into its broader transformation narratives, clients may see more value — but also more lock-ins. Early signals suggest WNS will retain its identity as a Business Services unit, but buyers will watch closely for changes in team structures and escalation paths, said Gogia.

Who: Kraft Heinz Foods Company is recalling 367,812 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original.

Why: The recall is due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Where: The recall is effective in the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

Kraft Heinz Foods Company has initiated a recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original, produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025, and distributed across the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Therecall was announced on July 2 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

The affected products include 12-ounce, 36-ounce and 48-ounce packages of Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL, with specific universal product codes and “use by” dates ranging from July 18, 2025, to Sept. 4, 2025. The products also bear lot codes RS19, RS40 or RS42 and display the USDA mark of inspection on their labels.

Consumers urged to check refrigerators and not to consume products, recall states

The potential contamination was identified through laboratory testing conducted by Kraft Heinz, which indicated the presence of Listeria monocytogenes.

Kraft Heinz urges consumers to check their refrigerators and freezers for the recalled products and advises not to consume the affected items.

“Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection,” the recall notice states. Listeriosis can lead to severe health issues, particularly in older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems and pregnant women and their newborns.

Kraft Heinz is actively working to address the issue by notifying retailers and ensuring the recalled products are removed from shelves.

Consumers seeking more information can contact Kraft Heinz’s consumer hotline at 1-800-280-7185 or email consumerrelations@kraftheinz.com. Additionally, the FSIS website provides updates on the Kraft Heinz turkey bacon recall and retail distribution lists.

Kraft Heinz says it has not received any reports of illness or injury related to the recall so far. The company is not currently facing legal action over the recall, but Top Class Actions follows recalls closely as they sometimes lead to class action lawsuits.

Recently, Boar’s Head Provisions Co. agreed to a $3.1 million settlement to resolve class action claims that it sold recalled meat products contaminated with listeria.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working.
AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI.
Including AI and data in HR skills strategies HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies.
Don’t forget the human element To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity.","For the first time in history, we're witnessing up to five generations working side by side – the silent generation, baby boomers, Gen X, millennials and Gen Z – with Gen Alpha also about to enter employment age.

All these generations are currently facing a common challenge: learning how to use AI effectively in the workplace. As generative AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, upskilling a multigenerational workforce presents a unique opportunity for HR leaders to improve productivity and engagement. Perceptions of AI and approaches to learning differ across the generations, so how can organisations equip employees of different age groups with the right skills to succeed in the age of AI?

Changing perceptions

One of the first hurdles is shifting the perception that AI is intimidating or overly complex, which could impact adoption in groups who don't consider themselves 'digitally savvy’. To change these perceptions, HR leaders need to empower employees to lead this transformation.

Today’s workforce has successfully navigated multiple technological disruptions. The AI revolution is simply the latest development. The technology promises to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on strategic work. This makes experience and business insight valuable attributes for employees. At Capgemini, I've seen many older colleagues embrace this change and sign up for AI training.

Redesigning career pathways

More than half of business leaders (56 per cent) and employees (54 per cent) believe AI is transforming how they work, according to Capgemini research. This will require reshaping job functions and workflows across all organisational levels.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working. HR leaders must re-evaluate workforce planning, roles and career pathways in light of the changes AI might bring.

Success depends on how well employees across generations integrate AI into their daily work. Only 16 per cent of employees report receiving ample support to develop generative AI skills and 46 per cent of leaders have been through formal Gen AI training.

As modern businesses navigate a landscape defined by significant technological change, they must cultivate the right skills across all age groups to harness AI effectively.

Embracing continuous learning and inclusive upskilling

A blanket approach to upskilling risks overwhelming employees and widening inequalities. Instead, HR functions need to embed learning as a continuous part of work, not an additional burden.

Embedding AI training into everyday workflows normalises learning and ensures all employees can train at their own pace according to their career goals. AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI. These initiatives can empower employees of any age to take on more strategic roles and enhance their sense of purpose.

Moreover, AI itself can facilitate accessibility by simplifying complex processes and bridging skill gaps between generations. Contrary to stereotypes, older professionals often find AI to be a great equaliser. Many AI tools feature intuitive interfaces that are accessible for people from all age groups. This allows experienced employees to leverage their deep industry knowledge alongside AI, potentially giving them an advantage over more tech-savvy but less experienced colleagues. The key lies in recognising individual strengths rather than relying on generational labels and promoting cross-generational learning between younger and older employees.

Including AI and data in HR skills strategies

HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies. Age-inclusion efforts require regular audits of engagement, promotion, skills proficiency and performance data.

Continuous employee feedback is also important for understanding the effectiveness of AI training programmes. This enables HR professionals to identify skills gaps, areas of improvement and biases, which helps ensure equitable development opportunities for everyone.

AI tools can also create a level playing field in recruitment and performance evaluation by removing human bias. This shift benefits older professionals particularly, creating more opportunities for career progression and meaningful contribution to the workplace.

Another important factor to consider is enabling employees to share their experiences and learn from each other. Creating forums such as multigenerational internal networks enables employees to share experiences and demystify age-related stereotypes.

Reverse mentoring, where younger employees guide older colleagues on new technologies, is another way to encourage intergenerational collaboration.

Don’t forget the human element

To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity. This tandem approach creates a workforce that is technically skilled, resilient, adaptable and connected.

As organisations face an unpredictable future, HR's role in guiding inclusive adoption of AI becomes paramount. By fostering environments where multigenerational teams thrive through mutual respect, tailored development and continuous learning, businesses can unlock innovation and gain a competitive advantage in the age of AI.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/OMP/CarolynMillerCorpPhotoHeadshotholly.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:31.462288

The deal, which is subject to approval by the workers, includes higher pay, larger pension contributions, health benefit and welfare improvements, and other changes. Workers will vote on the proposal over a three-day period that begins Wednesday.

The unions reached the agreement following what they said were more than 40 hours of talks with the grocers. UFCW locals 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428 and 1442 took part in the talks that led to the tentative agreement, which would cover workers for Kroger’s Ralphs banner and Albertsons’ namesake banner as well as its Vons and Pavilions supermarket chains.

The agreement comes just weeks after workers for the grocery chains voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike to protest what labor leaders from UFCW Locals 324 and 770 described as “labor violations throughout negotiations that have prevented workers from getting the fair contract they deserve.”

The alleged infractions by Kroger and Albertsons included “breaking the law by surveilling and interrogating employees in their stores, interfering with their discussions with union representatives, equating union support with disloyalty, and preventing them from wearing union insignia,” UFCW Local 770 said in a June 27 statement.

Albertsons said in a statement that the unfair labor practice allegations “are without merit,” adding that it remains ""committed to productive discussions with the UFCW.”

“We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and are negotiating in good faith to achieve a balanced agreement that rewards our associates, benefits our customers and is sustainable for our company in the competitive grocery industry,” the company said.

Favorable safety profile supports long-term use: No new safety signals were identified with Caplyta, with headache as the only adverse event occurring at ≥5% and twice the rate of placebo.

Significant unmet need in schizophrenia care: With up to 2.8 million US adults affected by schizophrenia and only 40% receiving adequate treatment, Caplyta may help fill a critical treatment gap.

Johnson & Johnson announced that it has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA, seeking an expanded indication for Caplyta (lumateperone) to include relapse prevention in schizophrenia. According to the company, the sNDA is based on positive data from a Phase III randomized withdrawal trial, which demonstrated that Caplyta significantly prolonged time to relapse compared to placebo.1

How Effective is Caplyta in Preventing Schizophrenia Relapse?

“For people living with schizophrenia, relapses can be devastating as they disrupt lives, undo hard-earned treatment progress toward patients’ goals, and increase the risk of hospitalization with each episode,” said Christoph U. Correll, MD, clinical professor of psychiatry, Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra/Northwell, New York, in a press release. “Caplyta substantially lowers the chance of relapse for patients compared to placebo, which is often a major source of anxiety and suffering for them and their families.”

Phase III Trial Results Support Expanded Indication

The double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Caplyta compared to placebo.

The primary endpoint of the trial was time to relapse during the 26-week double-blind treatment phase. The key secondary endpoint was delayed time to all-cause discontinuation, including relapse.

Results show that time to relapse was significantly longer in patients receiving Caplyta compared to those receiving placebo (p=0.0002). Patients treated with Caplyta demonstrated a 63% reduction in risk of relapse compared to placebo (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.37, [0.22, 0.65]).

Caplyta also demonstrated a significantly delayed time to all-cause discontinuation compared to placebo during the double-blind phase (p=0.0007).

Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring in at least 5% of patients and at twice the rate seen with placebo.

The safety profile of Caplyta was consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified.1

Global and US Schizophrenia Burden Underscores Unmet Need

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 24 million people are affected by schizophrenia globally, which is equal to approximately one in every 222 people. Those affected by schizophrenia are two to three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, primarily due to physical illnesses such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Onset is most common between late adolescence and the twenties, with men typically experiencing earlier onset than women.

Currently, half of patients in mental health facilities are living with schizophrenia; however, only 31.3% of people with schizophrenia receive specialist mental health care. WHO suggests that mental health facilities are not currently providing effective care for patients with schizophrenia.2

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the prevalence of schizophrenia in the United States is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.64%.3 According to Johnson & Johnson, this equates to 2.8 million adults, with around 40% receiving proper medical care. It is also estimated that patients with schizophrenia experience around nine relapses over the course of six years.1

Long-Term Data Reinforce Caplyta’s Role in Neuropsychiatric Care

“Relapse prevention is a critical goal for the long-term care and management of this debilitating disorder,” said Bill Martin, PhD, global therapeutic area head, neuroscience, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, in the press release. “These Phase III results provide compelling evidence of meaningful relapse prevention, which is critical in preserving long-term patient stability, breaking the cycle of hospitalization, and helping to control symptom progression. We’re committed to building on the decade of research reinforcing the robust efficacy, proven safety, and favorable tolerability of Caplyta and providing additional data to support the long-term use of this medicine in neuropsychiatric disorders.”

As the luxury automaker grapples with slowing demand in key markets, geopolitical tensions, and the costly shift to electrification, its ability to balance innovation with financial discipline will determine its future. Here's how Porsche is adapting—and whether investors should bet on its resilience.

Product Innovation: Electrification as a Double-Edged Sword

Porsche's push into electrification is both a strategic imperative and a financial burden. The all-electric Macan, launched in 2024, has become a critical growth driver, accounting for 14% of deliveries in early 2025. The model's success—14,185 units sold in Q1 alone—highlights consumer appetite for high-performance EVs. Porsche also plans an all-electric Cayenne, its best-selling model, by 2026, signaling its commitment to electrifying its core lineup.

However, this transition is costly. Special expenses for 2025 have surged to €1.3 billion, up from €800 million, due to battery tech investments and supply chain adjustments. The company acquired a majority stake in V4Smart GmbH & Co. KG to secure lithium-ion round cells, while its partnership with Varta AG aims to stabilize battery production. These moves underscore Porsche's resolve to control its supply chain—a necessity in an era of global competition for EV components.

Yet Porsche is hedging its bets. It has delayed plans to independently scale high-performance battery production via its subsidiary Cellforce Group, opting instead to focus on partnerships. This pragmatism reflects a recognition that electrification's ROI requires patience.

Market Challenges: Balancing Global Demand and Geopolitical Risks

Porsche's sales data reveal stark regional disparities. In Q1 2025, deliveries fell 7.9% globally to 71,470 units, driven by a 42% decline in China, its second-largest market. Intense competition in China's luxury EV segment—where local brands like NIO and Li Auto dominate—has forced Porsche to adopt a “value over volume” strategy. This means prioritizing brand prestige over mass sales, even as rivals undercut prices.

Meanwhile, North America saw a 37% surge in deliveries to 43,577 vehicles in H1 2025, partly offsetting losses elsewhere. Yet U.S. import tariffs imposed in April 2025 have strained margins, contributing to Porsche's revised 2025 forecasts.

The stock, down 12% year-to-date as of Q2 2025, reflects investor skepticism about near-term profitability. But Porsche's long-term focus on premium differentiation—via bespoke options like its Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur (offering over 1,000 customization choices)—could insulate it from price wars.

Financial Adjustments: Cost-Cutting to Offset Short-Term Pain

Porsche's financial adjustments are aggressive. The company aims to cut 3,900 jobs by 2029 through attrition and voluntary retirement programs, while halting fixed-term contracts for 2,000 roles. The “Road to 20” cost-reduction program targets a return to its long-term goal of >20% operating margins, down from 14.1% in 2024.

Revised 2025 forecasts reveal the trade-off: Sales revenue is now projected at €37–38 billion (vs. an earlier €39–40 billion), with operating margins dropping to 6.5–8.5% (from 10–12%). Yet Porsche is prioritizing structural health over short-term gains. CFO Dr. Jochen Breckner emphasized that these measures are “sustainably strengthening Porsche for the future.”

Investment Considerations: Is Now the Time to Bet on Porsche?

Porsche's strategy is clear: double down on EVs and exclusivity while cutting costs to preserve margins. But investors must weigh risks:

- Geopolitical Uncertainty: Supply chain disruptions, trade wars, and China's regulatory shifts could prolong headwinds.

- EV Adoption Speed: A slower-than-anticipated shift to electric vehicles could strain cash flows.

- Brand Dilution: Expanding EVs without sacrificing Porsche's “high-performance” identity is a tightrope walk.

The Bull Case: Porsche's brand equity, premium pricing power, and disciplined cost management could position it as a leader in luxury EVs. Its partnerships in battery tech and the delayed Cellforce expansion suggest a smarter use of capital.

The Bear Case: Near-term profitability is under pressure, and competition—especially from Tesla's Model X/Y and local EV players—is intensifying.

Final Analysis

Porsche's resilience hinges on executing a delicate balance: accelerate electrification without overextending financially, maintain exclusivity in oversaturated markets, and adapt to geopolitical shifts. For investors, this is a long-term play. While short-term volatility persists, Porsche's strategic moves suggest it's building a foundation for sustained premium growth.

Recommendation: Hold for long-term investors with a 5+ year horizon, but avoid if seeking quick gains. Monitor EV adoption rates and China's regulatory environment closely—these will be the ultimate tests of Porsche's resilience.

As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition.
Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”","Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster subsidiary has asked a federal judge in Central California for a judgment as a matter of law to throw out a jury’s antitrust verdict.

Last month, U.S. District Judge James V. Selna tripled the damages in the case to $442 million, a practice enabled under federal antitrust law. In May, the jury had found in favor of Scottsdale, Arizona–based Innovative Health on all of the questions over whether J&J had violated sections of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and California’s Cartwright Act through tying and other anticompetitive practices, allegedly maintaining a monopoly on cardiac mapping catheters and squeezing out reprocessors such as Innovative.

In its motion for summary judgment filed on July 3, J&J argues that the jury failed to make a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.

J&J’s lawyers said in the motion:

“The fundamental premise of IH’s tying theory was that Biosense possessed market power in a distinct market for clinical support services (a market that, as described below, was not shown). Biosense provided that service for free. This left IH to hang its case on the claim that Biosense used its market power to charge supracompetitive prices for its original equipment manufacturer … catheters in separate alleged single-brand catheter markets, thereby barring competition rather than simply competing with a competitor. But at trial, IH presented no evidence that Biosense was charging supracompetitive prices. As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition. In fact, the evidence showed that Biosense charged competitive prices, and the quality of these products continuously improved.”

In a motion replying to a separate motion seeking to prevent a permanent injunction, Innovative’s Health’s lawyers described Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster as a proven monopolist. “Requiring Innovative to play litigation whack-a-mole against Biosense would thwart the Sherman Act’s purpose to protect market competition. Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gavel-Medtech.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:13:31.320115

Kraft Heinz recalls 360,000 pounds of turkey bacon over scary concerns

Kraft Heinz (KHC) , a company behind popular brands such as Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Oscar Mayer, is recalling around 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon that might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

Listeria is a type of bacteria that thrives in cool and damp environments, even at temperatures as low as 31°F. When food comes into contact with Listeria, the bacteria spreads quickly. It is most commonly found in luncheon meats, such as dry sausages and hot dogs, but also in raw milk, ham, chicken salads, and more.

What happens if you eat food contaminated with Listeria?

You can get listeriosis, an infection that can be serious. Consumers especially vulnerable to listeriosis are pregnant women and their newborns, older people (65+), and those with weakened immune systems.

Infection during pregnancy is hazardous and can even lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Pregnant women with listeriosis often only have fever and similar flu-like symptoms.

Those who are not pregnant might have headaches, stiff necks, fevers, muscle pain, loss of balance, and convulsions. While the first symptoms might appear in a few hours to three days after consuming contaminated food, sometimes they take up to 2 months to appear.

While healthy people can have mild symptoms when infected with Listeria, older people and those with weakened immune systems can die.

More than 90% of people with listeriosis end up hospitalized, often in intensive care units, according to data from the FDA.

FSIS urges shoppers not to consume these products

The recalled Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL was produced from April 24, 2025, through June 11, 2025, and includes the following products:

12-oz. Vacuum-packed packages with universal product code (UPC) ""071871548601"" with dates ranging from July 18 to August 02 and lot code “RS40.”

These products were shipped to retail stores across the country, and some even reached the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses or adverse reaction to the consumption of these products have been reported, said FSIS, However, consumers concerned about an illness are advised to contact a health care provider.

Hershey on Tuesday named Wendy’s chief executive Kirk Tanner as its next CEO effective Aug. 18, according to a company statement.

The announcement brings Tanner back to the CPG industry, where he spent more than three decades at PepsiCo. Among other senior roles, he served as CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America, overseeing the growth of Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew.

Tanner replaces Michele Buck, who in January announced her intention to retire after eight years in Hershey’s top role. Buck will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity during the transition.

Dive Insight:

As CEO, Tanner will be responsible for building on Buck’s efforts to transform Hershey into a snacking powerhouse and diversify beyond sweets. Buck oversaw the company’s aggressive move into gummies and salty snacks and led some of the largest acquisitions in Hershey’s history, including a $1.6 billion purchase of SkinnyPop owner Amplify.

“Michele architected and championed Hershey’s Leading Snacking Powerhouse vision, guiding the company through multiple phases of transformational growth,” said Mary Kay Haben, lead independent director and chair of Hershey’s CEO Search Committee. “The impact of her courageous leadership, evolution of portfolio and capabilities, and authentic connection to people leave a legacy and a roadmap that positions Hershey well for the future.”

Still, Tanner joins at a precarious time for the snacking industry, which has experienced broad declines as consumers tighten their wallets and look for healthier alternatives. Hershey reported close to a 14% sales drop in the first quarter.

The candy giant also has struggled with higher cocoa costs amid fast-changing tariffs. The company expects tariffs to cost between $15 million and $20 million during the second quarter and asked the White House for an exemption for duties on cocoa.

At PepsiCo, Tanner led a transformation of the company's $28 billion beverage business, scaling brands, including Pure Leaf and bubly, and overseeing new innovation to address evolving consumer trends.

In addition to leading PepsiCo’s North American beverages business, Tanner also held several other senior leadership positions, including president of PepsiCo Global Foodservice and senior vice president of Frito-Lay North America’s West Division.

“Kirk is a proven, high-impact leader in the food and beverage industry with a great combination of customer and consumer passion, commercial acumen and operational scale,” Haben said. “His deep experience in snacks, beverages, M&A and innovation—combined with public company CEO and board roles—makes him well suited to lead Hershey into the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/orTfmCkfPC8KE1L8Cx1WZc6bLb8r3f249BI-ZXtaNEU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUxMzI0Njk0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-08 14:12:53.207855

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Shares of Franklin Resources have risen 10.9% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 11.9% gain and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLF) 26.8% return over the same period.

Shares of Franklin Resources climbed over 7% on May 2, driven by stronger-than-expected Q2 2025 revenue of $2.1 billion, which beat the estimate. The company also reported net income of $151.4 million, up 21.9% from the prior year, alongside a higher operating margin of 6.9%. Additionally, better-than-expected investment management fees of $1.67 billion and stable adjusted EPS of $0.47, which met consensus, supported investor confidence despite AUM and long-term net outflow challenges.

Analysts' consensus view on Franklin Resources’ stock is cautious, with an overall “Hold” rating. Among 12 analysts covering the stock, two recommend ""Strong Buy,"" five ""Holds,"" one suggests ""Moderate Sell,"" and four ""Strong Sells.""

Known as “Instacart Shoppers,” these workers play a valuable role in the grocery technology company’s ongoing growth in retail vendor space, as evidenced by the ongoing release of new earnings opportunities and safety features for them.

In its latest shareholder letter, Instacart said that it began piloting several new initiatives to provide its gig workers with more ways to earn money, including taking videos of store shelves to improve inventory transparency, letting them deliver customer orders from a distributor’s warehouse and allowing an Instacart shopper in one store the chance to find out-of-stock items from an order handled by another worker at another store.

Relying on its workers to track on-shelf inventory is “much more real-time than what we get from retailers,” then-CEO Fidji Simo told investors in February.

Along with earnings, Instacart has also revamped how it scores its workers. In April, the company unveiled plans to roll out a new tool that ranks how well its workers shop for customers with a sliding scale from “Needs work” to “Standard” to “Good” based on the number and condition of items the worker selected for their orders completed in the last 90 days.

That new tool is factoring into new and updated reward tiers as part of the Cart Star shopper rewards programInstacart revealed at the end of last month.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure.","The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is undergoing a seismic shift from fossil fuel dependency to a sustainable energy future, driven by net-zero commitments, fiscal pragmatism, and geopolitical realignments. At the epicenter of this transformation is Standard Chartered, whose recent strategic moves under leaders like Philippe Tabouis and Abbas Husain position it as a pivotal financier of the region's $2 trillion clean energy pipeline. For investors, this presents a rare convergence of policy tailwinds, scalable financing tools, and underserved infrastructure demand—arguing for immediate allocation to infrastructure funds or ETFs exposed to MENA's renewable transition.

Leadership Pivot: Tabouis and Husain's Dual Play

Standard Chartered's infrastructure strategy is being steered by two key figures:

- Abbas Husain, Global Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance, focuses on structuring deals in renewables, green hydrogen, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) across MENA and EMEA. His team has pioneered sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) and green bond frameworks to align financing with environmental metrics.

- Philippe Tabouis, Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance in Europe, brings Société Générale's expertise in cross-border project finance. His mandate includes bridging European capital markets with MENA's energy transition, exemplified by his role in the $8.5 billion Neom Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia.

Together, they are leveraging Standard Chartered's network to capture first-mover advantage in sectors like green hydrogen (a $13 billion market by 2030) and solar/wind energy, which now account for 40% of new MENA power capacity.

The Renewable Energy Gold Rush

MENA's energy transition is not merely theoretical—it is already financing billions in projects:

1. Neom Green Hydrogen: Tabouis' team acted as mandated lead arranger for this landmark project, which will produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen annually using solar and wind power. The deal's success underscores the viability of large-scale green loans, which now command premium pricing due to their ESG alignment.

2. Saudi Solar Dominance: Standard Chartered has underwritten over $5 billion in solar projects in Saudi Arabia, including the 1.5 GW Sakaka Solar Plant. These projects are structured as PPPs, with sovereign wealth funds like Public Investment Fund (PIF) sharing risk with international investors.

3. Qatar's Petrochemical Evolution: Even in hydrocarbons, the bank is pivoting toward sustainability—its role in the Ras Laffan Petrochemicals project included green financing terms requiring reduced carbon intensity.

PPPs and Policy Liberalization: The EMEA Catalyst

Governments in the region are accelerating PPP frameworks to attract private capital, particularly for water infrastructure and digital connectivity:

- Abu Dhabi's Noor II Street Lighting Loan: A $200 million PPP deal structured by Standard Chartered, demonstrating how even smaller-scale projects can attract institutional investors through risk-sharing mechanisms.

- Desalination Plants: The Rawabi desalination project in Saudi Arabia, financed via green loans, highlights the bank's ability to monetize water scarcity—a $23 billion opportunity in MENA by 2030.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are critical partners, co-financing deals and mitigating geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, policy reforms—such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Authority (PIA) privatization roadmap—are unlocking trillions in dormant infrastructure assets.

Financing the Transition: DFIs, ECAs, and Capital Markets

Standard Chartered's edge lies in its hybrid financing toolkit:

- Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs): These instruments, now used in 60% of the bank's MENA deals, tie interest rates to green targets (e.g., carbon reduction).

- Capital Market Refinancing: “Soft-mini perm” loans (short-term debt used to bridge to long-term bonds) are enabling projects like Neom to access yield-hungry bond markets.

- Institutional Investor Appetite: Over $2 trillion in global infrastructure capital is chasing MENA's pipeline, with Standard Chartered acting as a gateway for pensions and sovereign funds.

Note: STAN's outperformance since 2023 reflects growing demand for its regional expertise in sustainable finance.

Investment Thesis: Allocate Now to MENA's Green Pipeline

The convergence of policy momentum, capital market innovation, and underserved infrastructure demand creates a multi-year opportunity. Investors should prioritize:

1. Sector-Specific ETFs: The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IFRA) holds exposure to firms like Siemens Gamesa (wind) and Engie (utilities), while tracking projects in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

2. Green Infrastructure Funds: BlackRock Global Renewable Power Fund and Morgan Stanley Sustainable Infrastructure Fund directly target PPPs in solar/wind and green hydrogen.

3. Geographic Plays: Allocate to ETFs like iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (SAUD), which benefits from the kingdom's $1.3 trillion energy transition plan.

Risk Factors: Geopolitical instability, delayed policy reforms, and overvaluation in crowded renewable sectors. Mitigate these by focusing on debt instruments (e.g., green bonds) or funds with local partner expertise.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA

Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure. With DFIs, ECAs, and institutional capital now aligned, the time to act is now. Investors who allocate to MENA's renewable pipeline and EMEA's digital infrastructure will capture the next wave of returns in a world hungry for sustainable growth.

Note: MENA's share of global clean energy investment rose from 12% to 21% between 2023 and 2024—a trend likely to accelerate.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:09:08.224359

AI and machine learning are transforming private equity exit strategies by accelerating due diligence, enhancing portfolio monitoring and enabling faster, data-driven buyer analysis.

Advanced tech tools, including predictive analytics and ESG dashboards, not only support smarter investment decisions but also boost exit attractiveness by showcasing long-term value creation.

The mid-market and small-cap private equity sector is facing turbulence, driven by inflation and political instability, fueling uncertainty and volatility.

Due to this, firms are prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, emerging markets and technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for quick and accurate investment calls.

Fundraising remains a challenge, with over 70% of investors citing economic uncertainty and market volatility as top concerns.

Globally, private equity firms are sitting on $2.1 trillion, which can be used for new opportunities (“dry powder”). Most firms have allocated 30% of their capital to dry powder amid cautious optimism.

At least 80% of private equity workflows already rely heavily on technologies to source deals, conduct due diligence and manage portfolios; 95% of these firms are planning to multiply AI investments in the next 18 months.

This reliance has led to an evolution in exit strategies. Secondary buyouts and management/leveraged buyouts are making the most headway. To curb uncertainty in the market and challenges pertaining to liquidity, firms are exploring continuation funds and preferred equity options.

The private equity industry, despite sitting on a lot of dry powder, is encountering insurmountable pressure from Limited Partners (LPs) for efficient allocation of capital. General Partners (GPs) find themselves caught up with due diligence demands and allocation requirements amid market contraction risks.

Technological advancements have become enablers with AI, robotic process automation (RPA) and blockchain driving operational efficiencies. This encourages compliance and helps with decision-making. S&P Global found that 41% of private equity firms are in nascent adoption stages, 13% are at the advanced implementation stage and 7% have fully integrated technology.

In deal sourcing, AI can identify 195 relevant companies in the time it would take a junior analyst to evaluate one. Firms like Blackstone and EQT are investing in solely owned platforms like EQT’s Motherbrain, which consolidates 140,000+ data points for real-time M&A insights.

AI also assists with post-deal requirements like live portfolio monitoring and exit readiness by putting together information for a quicker turnaround on the buyer analysis for decision-making. Firms that delay tech adoption risk falling behind in fundraising and corporate governance and risk being left behind by competitors. Simultaneously, these advances have a real-world impact on the people in the industry, reducing the need for entry-level employees.

The investment projectile has evolved across four major phases: workflow automation and BPM services (before 2018); low-code/no-code platforms (2018-2020); early adoption of intelligent automation across the value curve (2021-2023); and a new era of intelligent automation powered by generative AI (2024-present).

Private equity firms are embracing the tech revolution to drive digital operations and unlock value across sectors.

The allied risks and limitations

AI has a significant impact on the private equity space, although there are reservations about its adoption and scope in the future. In light of the limited adoption rate, it is clear that only a fraction of private equity firms are exploring AI application use cases. These reservations are emanating from cybersecurity threats, opaque workflows and limited visibility on returns.

Having said that, it does contribute to operational efficiency and better portfolio performance. It also supports analysis, given its ability to skim through large and complex data sets, and is useful to entry-level employees as a learning and development tool.

These tools do enhance accurate decision making without negating human judgement, allowing organizations to act swiftly with precision. This has a cascading effect on revenue optimization, cost reduction and improved performance reporting and monitoring. For example, AI can help monitor KPIs across portfolios and processes in deal exits and capital distribution.

However, this shift brings significant risks. Kearney highlights seven key scenarios: rising ownership costs, unreliable data, questionable model outputs, cyber threats, IP disputes, AI-driven ESG platform concerns and negative socioeconomic impacts – all amid evolving regulatory pressures on governance.

It also emphasizes the importance of establishing robust governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to mitigate these risks. For example, some firms have created internal compliance forums to define acceptable AI use and ensure data protection. To successfully integrate AI, private equity firms must align AI initiatives with strategic goals, focus on high-impact use cases and ensure their technology infrastructure is ready. Standardizing and improving data quality across portfolios is also critical, as inconsistent data remains a major barrier to effective AI deployment. Firms that invest in preparing their data and tailoring AI models to their specific needs will gain a competitive edge.

Propelling the ESG engine forward

Private equity firms are leveraging state-of-the-art technologies of AI-driven predictive analytics and powering ESG data platforms to monitor and integrate metrics into their investment strategies. According to EY, private equity funds that have a well-integrated ESG framework have the potential to achieve an initial rate of return, which could be 8% higher than their competitors. This is mainly thanks to more accurate predictive models that provide organizations with the ability to assess value creation potential and sustainability risks over long periods at both deal and portfolio levels.

Bain and Company reports that, despite a low adoption rate of ESG initially, there has been an uptick in interest due to the consistency of data ESG operations provide and its potential long-term assurances. Firms now leverage AI/ML and natural language processing (NLP) to assess regulatory disclosures, sentiment analysis and supply chain data for ESG risks. This approach allows investors to pursue short-term value while staying aligned with long-term goals, supporting broader global efforts by businesses and governments to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_380dG0pxQ_6C-WjpawAW_RWRAy00C8-rSZ5EpzZN6-0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:35.900647

Utah and Virginia have both enacted bans on multiple artificial dyes in foods sold or served in public schools.

Kennedy Jr.’s campaign to eliminate synthetic food dyes from the American food supply is facing stiff resistance from one of the country’s most iconic candy makers — Mars, the manufacturer of M&M’s and Skittles.

Mars released a statement earlier this week saying that it will continue using the synthetic dyes in its candies, reversing a pledge the company made in 2016 to remove artificial colors from all foods and snacks in its portfolio.

The company insisted to the New York Times that its products are “safe to enjoy and meet the high standards and applicable regulations set by food safety authorities around the world.”

While Mars has made incremental changes — such as eliminating titanium dioxide from Skittles — it continues to rely on artificial colorings, citing challenges with cost, limited availability of natural alternatives and consumer preferences for brightly colored treats.

The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy makers, has echoed Mars’ position.

“People can freely buy cannabis, THC products, alcohol, and cigarettes – but vibrantly colored candy is an issue? Give me a break,” spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger told The Post.

Gindlesperger said that consumers “know that confectionery products are treats and that they contain sugar, food colors, and other FDA-approved ingredients, because candy is intrinsically transparent.”

“People have a unique mindset when they enjoy chocolate and candy that is not present when interacting with other foods. Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy as they have been for generations,” he said.

Gindlesperger added that the industry is “in firm agreement that science-based evaluation of food additives will help eliminate consumer confusion and rebuild trust in our national food safety system.”

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space, because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority.”

He noted that alternatives to synthetic dyes are more expensive, harder to source, and could raise prices due to limited supply.

“Companies need time to find alternatives,” Gindlesperger said.

The Post has sought comment from Kennedy, Mars and the National Confectioners Association.

Several leading food manufacturers have recently committed to removing synthetic, petroleum-based food dyes from their products in response to mounting public health concerns and growing consumer demand for cleaner ingredients.

Among the companies that have voluntarily agreed to eliminate synthetic dyes from their portfolios by the end of 2027 are Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestlé and ConAgra Brands.

Their decision follows advocacy efforts by health officials and organizations warning about potential links between artificial dyes and behavioral issues in children, as well as broader concerns over the safety of food additives.

In contrast, the candy industry has yet to fully embrace this movement.

While federal regulators have so far declined to crack down on artifical dyes, lawmakers at the state level have either introduced legislation or are considering proposals that would restrict or outright ban foods that contain synthetic coloring.

West Virginia has passed one of the most sweeping laws on synthetic food dyes, banning seven dyes and two preservatives from school meals starting Aug. 1 and from all foods sold statewide by Jan. 1, 2028.

California will prohibit Red Dye No. 3 and other additives in foods beginning Jan. 1, 2027, with a separate school ban on six synthetic dyes taking effect later that year.

Utah and Virginia have both enacted bans on multiple artificial dyes in foods sold or served in public schools. The Utah ban went into effect in March of last year while the Virginia ban will be effective July 1, 2027.

Aliko Dangote plans to scale up production at his Lagos-based fertilizer plant to meet Africa’s growing demand and reduce import reliance.

Dangote says Africa can become self-sufficient in fertilizer within 40 months, easing food production pressures and foreign exchange constraints.

A potential Nigerian Exchange listing could unlock new capital as the plant operates at just half its total production capacity.

Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has announced plans to expand his $3 billion fertilizer plant — Dangote Fertilizer Limited — as part of a wider effort to help the continent become self-sufficient in fertilizer production and reduce the high costs of imports. He made the announcement during the annual Afreximbank meeting held in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.

Dangote plans major fertilizer expansion

Dangote, who heads the Dangote Group — Africa’s most diversified industrial and manufacturing conglomerate — and is worth $23.3 billion according to Forbes, said the expansion will help meet Africa’s growing demand for fertilizer over the next 40 months.

He noted that the continent currently imports more than six million metric tons of fertilizer each year, a burden that’s made it harder for many countries to grow enough food, especially given challenging farming conditions.

“In the next 40 months, Africa will not import fertilizer from anywhere,” he said. “We’re moving fast. I want Dangote to be the biggest producer of urea in the world — bigger than Qatar. Just give me 40 months.” He added that increasing local production would ease the pressure on foreign exchange, a persistent challenge in Nigeria due to the weak naira.

NGX listing may reshape sector

This announcement comes at a time when Dangote Fertilizer Limited is preparing for a potential listing on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), which could value the company at more than $3 billion. The plant, located on a 500-hectare site in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, is already the largest of its kind in Africa. But for Dangote, it’s never just been about size or valuation. His goal has long been to rebuild domestic industries and reduce Africa’s dependence on imports.

The facility has the capacity to produce up to 3 million metric tonnes of urea each year, twice what Nigeria currently needs. That extra capacity is expected to lower prices for local farmers, allow for customized blends tailored to specific soil needs, and open up export opportunities across the region. In short, it’s about creating a more self-reliant agricultural sector — not just for Nigeria, but for Africa as a whole.

Starting July 8, the coffee giant will officially introduce the brand-new Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage to menus nationwide.

Inspired by the Italian word “strato,” which means “layer,” the drinks layer the Frappuccino with different cold foam flavors and colors.

The new drinks come as the classic Frappuccino celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.

“It’s the perfect time for a beverage like this,” Susan Engdahl, who is part of the team at Starbucks that helped create the beverage, said in a statement. “Customers know and love the Frappuccino blended beverage drink, and this gives them a new way to enjoy it.”

“As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Frappuccino, we’re excited to offer a modern take on a classic beverage, with layers of flavor and creamy texture that customers are craving right now.”

The three new Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverages include:

Brown Sugar Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage: A blend of Frappuccino Roast coffee, milk and ice, layered with brown sugar-flavored cream cold foam and topped with cinnamon.

Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage: A blend of Starbucks reformulated unsweetened matcha, classic syrup, milk and ice, layered with juicy strawberry-flavored cream cold foam.

Here’s what you need to know about the company’s Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches and the return of the Snack Wrap.

McDonald’s debuts new line of Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches

The McDonald’s Egg McMuffin breakfast sandwich is perhaps the most iconic fast food breakfast item in the world. As a matter of fact, it’s so iconic that McDonald’s has a page on its site dedicated to the history of the Egg McMuffin.

The delectable breakfast sandwich was first invented in 1971 by Herb Peterson, a McDonald’s owner in Santa Barbara, California. In 1972, the sandwich got its “Egg McMuffin” name and went on sale in test markets for just 63 cents apiece. And in 1975, McDonald’s rolled out the Egg McMuffin nationally.

Egg McMuffin 50th anniversary

Yes, it has now been 50 years since the Egg McMuffin’s national rollout, and in celebration of this milestone, McDonald’s is releasing a line of new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches.

The Spicy McMuffin sandwich has the egg, cheese, and bacon we all love, with the addition of a Spicy Pepper Sauce. McDonald’s is also releasing the Spicy Sausage McMuffin and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg to complete the lineup.

The Spicy McMuffin sandwiches go on sale today, Tuesday, July 8, and will only be available for a limited time. According to McDonald’s, they will be available at participating locations across the United States.

The beloved Snack Wrap returns, too

But what McDonald’s fans seem most excited about is the return of the Snack Wrap. The wrap was originally introduced in the United States in 2006 and became a favorite among many due to its crispy chicken and burrito-like form factor, making it easy to eat on the go.

The Snack Wrap featured white meat chicken, cheese, lettuce, and a choice of sauces.

But in 2016, McDonald’s discontinued nationwide sales of the Snack Wrap in the United States due to declining sales. Some locations still sold the handheld menu item until 2020, before it disappeared for good.

But now the Snack Wrap is back. McDonald’s has confirmed it will go on sale on Thursday, July 10. According to Axios, it is expected to be a permanent menu item and will cost $2.99.

Will menu changes help McDonald’s sales?

McDonald’s is bringing back the Snack Wrap and introducing new versions of a beloved classic at a time when consumers are increasingly conscious of the prices they pay for fast food, which was once seen as a reliable, low-cost meal option.

In recent years, fast food prices have skyrocketed, causing consumers to question their value.

Many fast food places have been trying to lure price-conscious consumers back with time-limited deals and special menu items, hoping that these will help boost their bottom line.

As for McDonald’s most recent quarter, fiscal Q1 2025, the burger chain reported a global comparable sales decrease of 1%. Sales were even worse in the United States, where comparable sales decreased 3.6%.

Since the beginning of the year, shares of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) have been on a bumpy ride. After falling to a year-to-date low of below $277 per share in January, MCD stock bounced back to highs of over $321 in May. But since then, MCD shares have tumbled again to close at under $294 as of yesterday. Since the new year began, MCD shares are now up about 1.2%.

Over the past 12 months, MCD shares have increased nearly 17%.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91364517-mcdonalds-big-announcement-return-of-the-snack-wrap-spicy-mcmuffin-breakfast-sandwiches.jpg",N,,2025-07-08 12:23:50.352503

Pardon the Disruption is a column that looks at the forces shaping food retail.

In the more than two years they spent trying to combine, Kroger and Albertsons held off on making any deep cuts to their businesses as they looked to curry favor with regulators and consumers.

But now that the supermarket megamerger isn’t happening, the two chains have returned in a big way to the tough but necessary work of making their stores, supply chains and corporate operations run more efficiently.

Call it making up for lost time. Kroger announced in late June that it plans to close 60 stores over the next year and a half. It promptly got to work, with local media reporting impending closures of company-owned stores across several regions. Albertsons, meanwhile, has laid off around 800 employees and shuttered close to a dozen stores so far this year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

There’s much more to come. Both grocers say they are looking to wring unnecessary costs out of their businesses and better focus their efforts on high-performing products and services. Albertsons is in the process of cutting $1.5 billion over a three-year period, while Kroger is looking to bring more discipline to its investments and cost structure.

“We’re going to modernize operations and ways of working across the board, from corporate to our stores and supply chain, to work smarter and more efficiently,” Kroger CFO David Kennerly said during the company’s earnings call at the end of June.

Instead of popping champagne, the nation’s largest supermarket chains are cutting deep so that they can continue battling the very forces that spurred their attempted merger. They are also suing each other over who’s to blame for the deal going up in flames.

The belt-tightening that both companies have embraced this year comes as no surprise, and it will go a long way toward keeping prices down and staying competitive. But Kroger and Albertsons can’t just hack and slash their way to a more compelling grocery experience. That’s going to take innovation and risk-taking. How will these supermarket giants beat the growing threat that low-price and specialty retailers pose?

Here are three things I’ll be watching in the months ahead.

All eyes on the CEOs

Both Kroger and Albertsons will forge ahead with new leadership at the helm. For Kroger, that new leader has yet to be identified four months after former CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an ethics review. Ron Sargent, who became interim CEO in March, said Kroger’s board of directors has formed a search committee and is currently working with a nationally recognized search firm to identify candidates.

As I wrote earlier this year, Kroger’s next permanent CEO will have a lot of challenges to address, including labor unrest, mounting industry competition, an overly complex e-commerce network and a brand campaign that’s starting to feel stale. The role also offers an opportunity to transform the conventional grocery model, and Kroger would do well to name someone with an innovative spirit.

Albertsons, on the other hand, has its new leader in Susan Morris, the former operations chief who took over for Vivek Sankaran in May. She’s coming into the CEO role at a difficult time. During the merger trial, lawyers painted Albertsons as a company with a bleak future. Since then, speculation has swirled about Albertsons eventually finding another suitor.

But Morris told The Wall Street Journal the company has no plans to sell. She said she wants to make Albertsons leaner and negotiate more forcefully with suppliers. She also sees opportunities to expand its leading retail media network and improve key areas like produce, private label and its loyalty program.

Morris told the Journal that Albertsons’ specialty is one-stop shopping. That may be true, but a lot fewer consumers are shopping this way than when Morris joined the company nearly 40 years ago. Albertsons needs to figure out how to be an important stop for today’s shop-around consumers.

What is Kroger going to do about e-commerce?

Kroger’s online business has been growing at a healthy clip. During its first fiscal quarter this year, e-commerce sales increased 15%, with delivery driving a growing number of households to engage digitally with the grocer. That’s well ahead of the overall sales growth rate in digital across the industry.

But e-commerce remains an unprofitable business for Kroger — and that needs to change, Sargent said during the company’s first-quarter earnings call.

“Our customers are embracing the whole digital model of our business. We are seeing improvements in profitability at an increasing rate. But to be clear… we’re not profitable at this point,” he said.

That’s an understandable goal, and one that comes at a time when fierce competitor Walmart says its online business is now profitable. Trouble is, Kroger seems to be a long way off from achieving this, with Sargent noting: “We still have a lot of work to do.”

The 800-pound gorilla in the room is Kroger’s network of automated fulfillment centers and spoke facilities powering its delivery service. This network needs to build scale and serve high levels of demand to achieve its full value, but right now Kroger and its fulfillment technology partner, Ocado, seem to be stuck figuring out how to make these facilities work for shoppers and Kroger’s bottom line.

Will both grocers continue to innovate?

Kroger and Albertsons have had a strong track record of innovation over the past several years. Both companies ramped up retail media and embraced trends like quick delivery, ghost kitchens and online marketplaces. While some of these bets didn’t pan out, their nimbleness and willingness to learn have been encouraging at a time of rapid evolution across retail.

Will that spirit of innovation diminish as the companies push for greater efficiency? That already seems to be happening, with neither company making the sort of eye-grabbing announcements in recent months that it used to.

I understand pulling back on e-commerce innovation, given how demand has moderated in that channel over the past two years. But Kroger and Albertsons need to take bold steps in areas that are key to their associates and in-store shoppers, including meal solutions, loyalty programs and employee services.

I live in an area that’s packed with QFC, Fred Meyer and Safeway stores, and I can tell you that none of them come to mind when I think, “What’s for dinner?” All of these locations carry prepared meals, salad kits, packaged sushi and more, but the selections are usually uninspiring and merchandised in out-of-the-way areas that make it feel like the companies are checking boxes rather than trying to entice shoppers.

McDonald’s McMuffin turned 50 this year, but it's just getting hotter.

The global fast food chain is bringing out new varieties to help ""spice up"" its breakfast menu in honor of the anniversary, including a Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The new muffin choices will feature their traditional ingredients — cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, according to a McDonald's news release.

The Egg McMuffin debuted in 1975 when Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, wanted to create a take-out version of Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

When is McDonald's Spicy McMuffin available?

The items are available beginning July 8 for a limited time at participating locations, according to the company.

McDonald's adds Daily Double burger to menu

That's not the only new thing under the golden arches. McDonald's has also added a new double burger on its menu: the Daily Double.

The Daily Double, available now nationwide, is made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices. The burger had been available in limited markets including Miami, Chicago and Seattle, but will be available nationally through 2025, the company said.

On July 22, the Daily Double will join McDonald's McValue Meal Deal options, served with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and small soft drink ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant). That menu still includes the $5 Meal Deal.

The burger is now appearing in the McDonald's app, where you can also get deals including a free medium order of fries with a $1 purchase in the app every Friday through the end of 2025.

Coming soon: the Snack Wrap

After nearly a decade, McDonald's announced the return of the Snack Wrap, one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. They're available in either Spicy (with a habanero kick) or Ranch (with Ranch dressing and hints of garlic and onion).

The Snack Wrap will be available on its own or in a combo meal featuring two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Snack Wraps will be coming back to store menus permanently beginning Thursday, July 10, the company said.

To celebrate the return of the item, McDonald's has launched snackwrapfiles.com, a website they're calling ""fans’ VIP entry to all things Snack Wrap.""

Tanner, who served as the CEO of Wendy’s for nearly a year and a half, was with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) before that for three decades. He assumed several leadership roles during his time at the beverage maker, including CEO of PepsiCo North America, overseeing the growth of brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, and Mountain Dew.

Hershey’s shares were down 2.5% in early trading. The stock has gained 2% year-to-date.

Tanner will succeed Michele Buck as president and CEO, effective August 18.

Buck led Hershey for seven years and is retiring in 2026. She will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity to ensure his successful transition.

In May, Hershey topped quarterly results driven by demand for its salty snacks business in North America. The company, which houses Dot’s Pretzels, had seen demand pick up after product prices were lowered following several rounds of price hikes over the last few years.

Retail sentiment on Hershey has been ‘bearish’ over the past month, according to data from Stocktwits.

Separately, Wendy’s said it has appointed Ken Cook, its chief financial officer, as interim CEO. Cook, who remains CFO, joined the company in December 2024 and was previously with United Parcel Service (NYSE: ) for 20 years, including serving as head of Financial Planning and Analysis.

Wendy’s said its board has launched a comprehensive search process to select a permanent CEO.

The fast-food chain’s sales have slowed in 2025, particularly in the U.S., where consumer demand has wavered and traffic declines have impacted performance.

Wendy’s shares were down marginally. Stocktwits data showed the retail sentiment on the stock was in the ‘bearish’ territory, compared to ‘neutral’ a week ago.

According to Sherlock’s research, employees in many companies waste up to 20 percent of their time navigating unclear roles and responsibilities. This finding is reinforced by McKinsey’s State of Organizations 2023 report, which identified unclear roles as a top contributor to organizational inefficiency.

Org.Works launches at a time when companies are under pressure to move quickly in response to rapidly changing technology and market conditions. Many attempt to adapt by adding C-suite roles, launching new departments, or undergoing constant reorganization—often without improving execution. Current client work includes advising on AI strategy and structure, IT department design, digital and marketing team structure, and leadership realignment to improve decision-making and delivery.

“Too many organizations prioritize speed and innovation but overlook whether their structure supports either,” said Dr. Sherlock, who previously served as Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Ralph Lauren and now leads Org.Works. “Innovation, decision-making, and execution need to move fast—but organization structure must be the foundation that enables that speed, not the shifting sands beneath it.”

Sherlock’s recent TEDx talk, “Clarity Before Chaos: Building Organizations That Work,” was recently selected as a TEDx Editor’s Pick, an honor awarded to fewer than one percent of all TEDx talks globally. TED described the talk as “a valuable and timely idea for our global audience.”

She is recognized as a leading voice in both corporate and academic communities on organizational design, executive structure, and technology leadership. Her work has been cited in academic literature and featured in Business Insider’s article, “Why the C-Suite Is Getting So Big,” where she highlighted the risks of executive role proliferation and structural misalignment.

The new menu items include the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg — all featuring the restaurant's new Spicy Pepper Sauce, the company said in a press release.

The nationwide offering coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, the sandwich credited with ushering in the chain's now-famed breakfast service.

Why It Matters

Breakfast menus have become a crucial battleground for fast food brands, with U.S. consumers increasingly seeking novel flavors and limited-time options.

The new sandwich highlights McDonald's efforts to capitalize on the ""spicy"" food trend, which has seen increased popularity across American fast food menus.

Industry analysts have noted that menu additions can drive short-term sales and boost brand engagement during seasonal promotions.

What To Know

The new sandwiches maintain the core elements of a McMuffin — cheddar cheese, a freshly cracked egg, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a toasted English muffin — but incorporate McDonald's signature Spicy Pepper Sauce. This blend offers ""a fiery, delicious twist,"" the company said.

McDonald's also said that its U.S. eggs are now ""100% cage-free,"" which is part of its broader ingredients update that aims to align with consumer demand for animal welfare.

The menu change marks the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin's nationwide rollout. Herb Peterson, a former McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, created the sandwich in 1971 with the aim to produce a portable version of eggs benedict.

The innovation eventually gained national attention, notably through the efforts of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc, and played a pivotal role in establishing breakfast as a major sales segment for the chain.

Spicy flavors have become a focal point for fast food innovation, with multiple chains introducing heat-centric menu items to appeal to evolving consumer palates. McDonald's expansion into spicier breakfast options reflects a broader industry movement and an effort to differentiate its morning menu.

What People Are Saying

McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said in a press release earlier this year: ""At McDonald's, breakfast isn't just a meal; it's a cherished tradition and cornerstone of our brand... Every morning when we open our doors, we are a breakfast restaurant. Whether it's my personal favorite, the Egg McMuffin, or our crispy Hash Browns, fluffy hotcakes, or sweet and savory McGriddles, we're all about giving our customers the best start to their day. Our fans know they can always count on us for a one-of-a-kind breakfast experience, anchored in great value and high-quality ingredients.""

David Peterson, son of Herb and a McDonald's owner/operator, said: ""When I watched my father introduce this idea to Ray Kroc, we could not have anticipated it would become the foundation for the renowned McDonald's breakfast menu... It's been remarkable to see people embrace this innovation over the last five decades, and now we get to share that heritage with a new generation of breakfast fans.""

What Happens Next

Availability of the new breakfast sandwich may vary by location depending on franchise participation.

McDonald's urged customers not to delay, saying: ""The Spicy McMuffin won't last forever.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2678782/mcmuffin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:00.782426

Carrier revenue per parcel ticked down to $9.09 down from $9.10 in 2023, according to Pitney Bowes.
“Since Pitney Bowes began tracking shipments a decade ago, the parcel market has been dominated by FedEx, UPS and USPS.
“This disruption presents a unique opportunity for businesses to take advantage of competitive pricing.” The Pitney Bowes findings echo earlier research from parcel management and consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc.

Smaller carriers are increasingly taking market share from legacy carriers FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, but their biggest threat is Amazon. The retailer’s logistics operation handled 6.3 billion parcels in 2024, up 7.3% year over year, and is expected to overtake the Postal Service by 2028, Pitney Bowes (NYSE: PBI) said in its recent Parcel Shipping Index.

The provider of mail and parcel shipping services, technology and equipment said U.S. parcel volume increased 3.4% to 22.4 billion shipments last year and estimated it will grow 5% per year to $30.5 billion in 2030. Revenue, however, grew 2.7% last year to $203.2 billion.

Carriers are increasingly offering competitive pricing to attract customers, leading to lower revenue. Carrier revenue per parcel ticked down to $9.09 down from $9.10 in 2023, according to Pitney Bowes. Independent couriers gaining market traction in recent years include OnTrac, Better Trucks, Jitsu, Veho, SpeedX, Speedy Delivery and UniUni. Many of them are startups or provide regional service with lower overhead than national carriers. The U.S. Postal Service’s new lost-cost shipping option, Ground Advantage, has also contributed to the pricing pressure.

“Since Pitney Bowes began tracking shipments a decade ago, the parcel market has been dominated by FedEx, UPS and USPS. We are witnessing a turning of the tide, evidenced by the nearly 40% volume growth in the five-year compound annual growth rate of [alternative] carriers,” said Pitney Bowes Executive Vice President Shemin Nurmohamed, in a news release. “This disruption presents a unique opportunity for businesses to take advantage of competitive pricing.”

The Pitney Bowes findings echo earlier research from parcel management and consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc. It put domestic parcel revenue at $188 billion and average revenue per parcel at $8. Domestic parcel volumes will grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next three years, with Amazon, Walmart and other carriers winning the lion’s share of new business. FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service will likely experience flat to negative growth, ShipMatrix said.

The U.S. Postal Service retained its hold as the largest parcel carrier by volume with 6.9 billion shipments in 2024, an increase of 3.4% from the prior year, per Pitney Bowes. UPS volume increased 1.7% to 4.7 billion pieces. FedEx was the only carrier to experience a year-over-year decline, with 3.9 billion parcels compared to 3.7 billion in 2023.

Brothers John, Bryant and Jason Corona have partnered with their father, Juan Corona, and uncle, Saul DeLa Rosa, to expand Broken Yolk’s presence in Southern California. Juan was the first-ever franchisee to join El Pollo Loco in 1981. The family also operates multiple Movita Juice Bar locations.

“Our family had the opportunity to dine in at one of Broken Yolk Cafe’s Las Vegas locations not too long ago, and the experience left a lasting impression,” said John Corona. “The food was incredible, the hospitality was infectious, and after getting to meet the brand’s president for ourselves, it was clear the leadership and direction of the franchise were second to none.”

Founded in 1979 in the San Diego area, Broken Yolk has expanded into Idaho, Nevada, Arizona and Texas. The chain operates a systemwide total of 41 locations.

Moms are very often the lead decision makers for family purchases – and product information plays a key role in what they decide to purchase.

A new survey from motherhood and pregnancy media outlet What to Expect reveals that more than three-quarters (77%) of mothers are primary decision-makers for family purchases, with more than half (55%) saying that managing family finances mostly falls to them.

More than half of moms (57%) surveyed said “proven safe” is a top priority when buying for their kids, and 52% say they’ve walked away from a product because of poor online reviews. A quarter of moms said they’ve skipped a purchase entirely because the product lacked enough photos or details that could address any safety factors or concerns.

Forty-three percent of moms said they want to choose products that make them feel like they’re doing the best they can for their family.

Product reviews are key to purchase decisions, especially with prices remaining high amid new tariffs on imported goods. What to Expect said that one mom in its survey said “I care about quality, ease of use and adaptability, but I also have a tight budget.” Another noted that she struggles with “having to choose between so many options, and price differences.”

It remains unclear if countries will be able to negotiate with the Trump administration after this week’s deadline, but Bessent said the Aug. 1 implementation date does not mean the 90-day tariff pause has been extended.

“It's not a new deadline. We are saying this is when it's happening,” Bessent said. “If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice.”

Since the reciprocal tariff announcement in early April, the U.S. has come to terms on deals with three countries, according to Trump. Most recently, Trump said his administration reached a deal with Vietnam wherein imports from the country would be charged a 20% tariff upon entering the U.S.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BuQKvz-0kiAd1KRtUzGGW8UbzALB8mEMAc_Vk9hcZu8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjIxNjI4MDM3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-08 12:23:02.254402

The $3.3 billion all-cash deal brings together two complementary giants, enabling Capgemini to deepen its Digital Business Process Services (BPS) portfolio, especially as enterprises worldwide seek AI-powered operational transformation.

Why This Acquisition Matters

WNS’s strength lies in domain-centric digital services delivered through 25 Indian delivery centres. With 40000+ employees and a strong presence in verticals like banking, healthcare, logistics, and insurance, the acquisition adds scale and specialization to Capgemini’s already diverse global footprint.

The 28 percent premium reflects WNS’s strategic value, driven by long-standing relationships and deep domain knowledge. The integration also aligns well culturally and operationally, ensuring smoother post-acquisition synergy.

AI and Intelligent Operations Take Center Stage

Capgemini is betting big on AI. With over euro 900 million in Gen AI bookings in 2024 and partnerships with Google, AWS, Microsoft, and NVIDIA, this acquisition positions the company as a front-runner in intelligent operations. WNS’s expertise in domain-led, automation-first models complements Capgemini’s platform-driven vision of transforming businesses from digital to autonomous.

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat emphasized that the shift toward autonomy—where businesses embed AI across workflows—is the future. WNS CEO Keshav Murugesh echoed this, noting clients now seek deeper transformation rather than just efficiency through automation.

India at the Heart of It

India continues to play a pivotal role in global BPM, contributing over 50 percent of WNS’s revenue. The country offers both cost and talent advantages, and centres like Vizag and Hyderabad are now key nodes in the global delivery network. With WNS now part of Capgemini, this strategic presence will likely expand further, reinforcing India’s dominance in global service delivery.

What’s Next?

The transaction awaits regulatory and shareholder approvals, including from the Royal Court of Jersey. If completed as planned by year-end, the merged entity will become a formidable player with euro 23.3 billion in revenue and an expanded Digital BPS footprint—ready to lead in the AI-first era of business transformation.",https://trak.in/stories/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-at-7.13.28 AM-1024x572.png,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:13.735238

And what they had said at the time was that this assumes that tariffs stay exactly the same as they are.
But now we're seeing shares sort of revert here as these, as these retailers sort of try to understand how exactly they can stock up accordingly from the holiday.
But what we saw there was we saw shares pull back on Monday morning, down roughly 4% there in after-hours trading, or rather at the close.
What we know there is that these Lululemon, a key source they have there is from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand.","Brooke, I know you've been talking to a lot of retailers. I thought it was really interesting initially when that sort of Vietnam deal was announced, or the framework for a deal, the outline of a deal. We saw shares of companies like Lululemon go up. We saw them pull back a little bit yesterday, and I guess some of this is just reflecting the environment that these companies are navigating.

Certainly. What I'm hearing from my sources is that uncertainty here is really the name of the game as these retailers try to make way and stock up ahead of that key back-to-school shopping season, and really that key holiday season. And what we've seen over the past two days is that, take for example, Best Buy. We saw the company put out their updated guidance in late May of this year. And what they had said at the time was that this assumes that tariffs stay exactly the same as they are. Now what we know here is that Best Buy sources 40% of their electronics from Vietnam, India, South Korea, and Taiwan. Now, what we heard yesterday is now we have South Korea at 25%. We also heard last week that Vietnam is at 20%. And so now that updated guidance may be in question here. And that's what really led the stock to move lower on Monday, down roughly 2% according to our Yahoo Finance toolbox here. But now we're seeing shares sort of revert here as these, as these retailers sort of try to understand how exactly they can stock up accordingly from the holiday. Now, another company they want to take a look at is Lululemon. Of course, they're the apparel company. They make athletic gear. They make the shoes. But what we saw there was we saw shares pull back on Monday morning, down roughly 4% there in after-hours trading, or rather at the close. And now those shares are pulling back a bit. What we know there is that these Lululemon, a key source they have there is from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. Now we're hearing those rates, those tariff rates coming higher. And also, as you could see here, what we talked about last week is those sneaker giants key sourcing regions that they source from include Vietnam, Indonesia, and China. And now we're hearing of higher tariff rates from there as well. And so certainly it's creating a lot of uncertainty. That's still the key word when it comes to these retail stocks as they really did attempt to pull forward, but now, as we heard from Target, that somewhat led to excess inventory. And now what we're seeing this week, those mega deals from Amazon, Walmart, even Tractor Supply, and Home Depot, and Best Buy also getting in on this big deals week.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Y5Lj7gu9v0qQoQlwli3vFg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/64b28fd0-5bfe-11f0-9297-cc9b01d5caab,N,,2025-07-08 13:13:01.408042

“We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers,” Nestle’s U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement. “As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them.”

Nestle said 90% of its U.S. products already contain no synthetic dyes. The company has been removing them from its products for the past 10 years, it said in a statement.

Nestle’s announcement dovetails with those of other major U.S. food companies.

Kraft Heinz and General Mills previously announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027.

General Mills said it plans to remove synthetic dyes from its U.S. cereals and all foods served in K-12 schools by mid-2026, and J.M Smucker Co. said it intends to remove artificial colors from its products by the end of 2027, according to media reports.

Petroleum-based food dyes have been linked to a variety of health concerns, including allergies, cancer and behavioral changes.

They are synthetic color additives derived from crude oil and include artificial dyes such as Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Blue No. 1.

The recent moves follow decades of scrutiny.

In January, the U.S. government banned Red No. 3 from the nation’s food supply, nearly 35 years after the dye was banned from cosmetics due to potential cancer risks.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among the strongest critics of these additives.

In April, he and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary announced that the FDA is asking food companies to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of next year and substitute petrochemical dyes with natural ingredients.

“We have a new epidemic of childhood diabetes, obesity, depression, and ADHD,” Makary said in a statement. “Given the growing concerns of doctors and parents about the potential role of petroleum-based food dyes, we should not be taking risks and do everything possible to safeguard the health of our children.”

About two-thirds of Americans support restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove added dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll cited by CBS News.

Many states are taking this matter into their own hands.

California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.

In late June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring a new safety label on foods made with synthetic dyes or additives. The label will state that the products contain ingredients “not recommended for human consumption.”

Why it matters: The contracts for 116,000 tons of CO2 removal between 2028 and 2030, for buyers working through the Frontier consortium, comprise Arbor's biggest deal yet.

It's one of the ""anchor agreements"" that will help the 3-year-old startup finance and build its first commercial-scale plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana, CEO Brad Hartwig tells me.

Driving the news: Buyers include Stripe, Google, Shopify, McKinsey, Autodesk, H&M and various others.

The new deal follows a much smaller agreement with Microsoft last year.

How it works: Arbor is a bioenergy with carbon capture (BECCS) startup, using waste biomass that will initially come from forest management.

But it's an evolution of BECCS, with 99% capture and high efficiency, a blog post states.

Its process first gasifies biomass, then burns that gas in a special furnace with pure oxygen (""oxy-combustion""), producing water but also ""supercritical"" CO2 that drives a turbine.

This simplifies and reduces CO2 capture costs, and the water can be used for irrigation or data center cooling, Arbor and Frontier said.

Reality check: First-of-a-kind hardware systems often don't survive the journey to commercial deployment or scale.

But Hartwig sees Arbor's system among the energy sources that stand to benefit from the AI boom.

""Demand for carbon-free energy is just accelerating at rates that are completely unprecedented, and we have a pretty unique technology stack that can deliver 24/7, carbon-free energy that is cheap and firm,"" he tells Axios.

What we're watching: ""We've gotten a lot of interest from a whole host of folks, from hyperscalers to regulated utilities looking to develop projects for matching supply with load for data centers,"" Hartwig said.

The intrigue: Asked whether Trump 2.0's reversal of climate policies creates headwinds, he argued the opposite, citing ""real interest in baseload power that can add to grid resilience.""

He also said behind-the-meter deployments are possible, avoiding the need for transmission or waiting in interconnection queues.

State of play: ""Its compact design features an 18 MW turbine about the size of a car engine, allowing for efficient scaling and cost reductions,"" the announcement states.

Its modular system and oxy-combustion tech don't produce exhaust or pollution, avoiding the cost of adding separate CO2 capture units.

Scaling the technology provides an eventual pathway toward getting under $100/ton of removal, the post states.

The tech also works using natural gas, which would provide power with CO2 capture, but it's not removal without the biomass.

The bottom line: ""The demand from AI is a big part of helping pull technologies like ours across the development valleys of death, to get a new technology into the world,"" Hartwig said.",https://images.axios.com/qrL0fG8lxmy16vSCUiwY4oIBqx8=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/07/07/1751929782005.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:01.512991

Plant-based nutrition brand Kate Farms has launched two high-protein shakes to tackle “critical nutrition gaps” from GLP-1 use, its first product since its acquisition by Danone.

Just a week after finalising its takeover by dairy giant Danone, US plant-based nutrition firm Kate Farms is taking on Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and the like with new shakes that target a major side effect.

These weight-loss drugs work by suppressing people’s appetite, and this can lead to muscle loss and “critical nutrition gaps”, the brand said. Research shows that GLP-1 use can lead to a 25-40% decrease in muscle mass over eight to 16 months, several times greater than non-medicated weight loss approaches and age-related muscle loss.

Kate Farms’s High-Protein Nutrition Shakes have been specifically formulated to address this “unmet health need”. Made from a base of pea protein, they’re designed to support muscle health, manage weight, and navigate GLP-1 treatment.

“We’ve heard clearly from healthcare professionals and GLP-1 users that appetite suppression often leads to unintentional muscle loss and nutrient gaps. That’s a serious concern,” Kate Farms CMO Catherine Hayden tells Green Queen.

“This product was developed with those insights in mind: 25g of protein, 6g of fibre for digestive health and satiety, and 27 essential vitamins and minerals,” she adds.

Built on input from health experts and GLP-1 users

The shakes are available in chocolate and strawberry flavours, and contain no sugar, instead relying on monk fruit and stevia leaf extracts for sweetening. They contain Spectra, a plant-based phytonutrient blend shown to stimulate antioxidant activity and inhibit free radical production.

The 325ml cartons contain all nine essential amino acids that our bodies can’t produce, making the shakes a complete protein. They’re available in a ready-to-drink format on its website and Amazon for $55 per 12-pack.

The nutrition shakes are the result of 18 months of R&D and hundreds of rounds of iteration, nutrient refinement, and quality assurance. Kate Farms studied the nutritional shortcomings of existing options on the market and consulted with leading healthcare experts and GLP-1 users.

“We conducted extensive taste testing at our Innovation and Quality Center, which is co-located with our headquarters. This included preference testing and sensory panels – particularly with GLP-1 users – who helped shape the final flavour and formula,” explains Hayden.

“GLP-1 users have expressed experiencing changes in their perception of flavour while taking these medications, particularly becoming more sensitive to sweetness,” she adds, nodding to a phenomenon dubbed ‘Ozempic tongue‘.

“Our sensory work included panellists currently taking GLP-1 medications, in addition to panellists not currently taking those medications, to ensure that we were able to delight consumers, regardless of what tools they are using on their health journeys. We didn’t launch until we had something people genuinely wanted to drink every day.”

Why Kate Farms is focusing on GLP-1 and protein

One in eight Americans has already used a GLP-1 medication, and forecasts suggest this could rise to up to 70 million people by 2028 – and by that year, they’ll likely have boosted the national GDP by 1%.

Ozempic and its counterparts have had a knock-on effect on the food industry, with GLP-1 users spending 11% less on most categories of food, and over half (56%) aiming to make healthier food choices. Foods high in sugar, fat and calories stand to lose, while protein and fibre are all the rage.

Food companies are already rethinking their offerings. Nestlé has a new brand dedicated to GLP-1 users, Coca-Cola has launched a prebiotic soda, while PepsiCo bought Poppi for nearly $2B. Conagra Brands has introduced ‘GLP-1 friendly’ labels on packaging for some of its Healthy Choice ready meals, and Daily Harvest (now owned by Chobani) now offers a line of high-protein, high-fibre smoothies.

“The rise of GLP-1s has reinforced that people need clinically precise, sustaining nutrition, and we’re proud to deliver it,” says Hayden, before adding: “This shake was purpose-built for anyone navigating health change – whether or not they’re using GLP-1 medications. We’re focused on people managing weight intentionally, supporting muscle health and seeking doctor-trusted, clean-label nutrition that works.”

The launch serves the growing demand for protein. A 3,000-person survey last year found that the two nutrients Americans are most interested in consuming were protein (71%) and fibre (64%). And polling by Chobani revealed that 85% of these consumers are looking to add more protein to their diet this year.

“Protein is more in demand than ever because people are focusing on strength, muscle health and long-term health – especially amid weight-loss journeys or GLP-1 treatment. But not all protein is created equal,” says Hayden, pointing to the complete amino acid profile of its shakes. “It’s clinically developed, allergen-free and designed without artificial sweeteners or preservatives – helping consumers feel the difference in both taste, quality and outcomes without compromising on ingredient selection of quality.”

She continues: “While plant protein may have had sensory hurdles in the past, we are seeing an increasing number of consumers who are seeking to add more plants to their diets. Plant-based protein options are currently outpacing growth in the ready-to-drink protein shake market. The opportunity that we see is to bring our wholesome ingredients with clinical precision to the growing plant-based segment.”

Danone acquisition will help Kate Farms expand nutrition access

The High-Protein Nutrition Shakes are the first products Kate Farms has launched as a Danone portfolio company. The two companies announced the acquisition in May, with the goal of expanding the firm’s nutrition formulas and shakes to hospitals and consumers across the US and beyond.

“This is a merger of missions. Danone shares our belief that good nutrition is essential to better health and that alignment is what makes this partnership so meaningful,” says Hayden.

While these new shakes were already in development before the acquisition, they represent “exactly why the partnership makes sense”: “It’s about scaling purposefully – meeting more people’s needs with science-based, high-integrity nutrition. We see this as the first of many innovations that reflect our shared mission.”

Founded in 2012, Kate Farms has raised $188M over several rounds to date, including a $75M Series C round led by Novo Holdings, the parent company of Ozempic and Wegovy manufacturer Novo Nordisk. It has a deep focus on the concept of food-as-medicine. According to a poll by the Rockefeller Foundation last month, nine in 10 patients would prefer to rely more on healthy eating than on medications to manage their condition.

“Kate Farms is staying focused on what we’ve always done best: providing clinically-developed, plant-based nutrition that’s trusted by doctors and loved by customers,” Hayden says when asked about the firm’s plan over the next 12 months.

“Being part of Danone allows us to bring that same high-integrity nutrition to more people across both medical and everyday wellness settings – while maintaining the standards, intention, and care Kate Farms is known for.”",https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/danone-kate-farms-ozempic-glp-1-high-protein-plant-based-nutrition-shakes-social.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:36.878405

In separate moves two months ago, Danone bought a majority interest in plant-based nutritional product provider Kate Farms and launched a line of ready-to-drink Oikos Protein Shakes targeting both fitness enthusiasts and the rapidly growing market of users of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

Timed to leverage Amazon Prime Day, Kate Farms today launches its own High Protein Nutrition Shakes, designed specifically “for people managing weight intentionally, including those using GLP-1s,” Kate Farms CMO Catherine Hayden tells Marketing Daily.

Hayden stresses that both Kate Farms and Oikos “are focused on expanding access to high-quality nutrition and addressing evolving consumer health needs.”

And both are looking to make inroads in what Hayden cites as a nearly $2 billion U.S. protein shake market. Within that category, though, is “an outsized level of growth in the plant-based segment,” she says. “The opportunity we saw was to bring our wholesome ingredients with clinical precision to [that] segment.”

The clinical part is key as, unlike Oikos, Kate Farms comes to the CPG protein shake market not from selling yogurt but from a nine-year history of selling both nutritional shakes and tube-feeding formulas to the healthcare community.

Yet, while most of Kate Farms’ business comes from such B2B sales (it now supplies product to more than 1,400 hospitals), the marketer is not new to CPG. It began selling in natural food stores even before its B2B push began. Its line of Nutrition Shakes now represent Kate Farm’s fastest-growing product segment, Heyden says, with special appeal to people with food sensitivities.

The difference between Kate Farms’ High Protein Nutrition Shake and other products, she claims, is plant-based nutrition “with clinical precision…developed with the same rigor as our medical nutrition portfolio.”

The new product is launching on Amazon Prime Day “to reach highly engaged shoppers and drive early trial and awareness,” says Hayden. It's also available via KateFarms.com, to reach consumers “already searching for trusted, high-protein options.”

Retail expansion is then planned for later this year and 2026, she says.

“We’re also actively engaging healthcare professionals [HCPs] so they can confidently recommend [the shake] to patients who need clean-label, high-protein nutrition,” she adds.

Marketing of the High Protein Nutrition Shake is being targeted to both HCPs and consumers via a “multichannel approach… anchored in the idea of Protein with Purpose—the belief that protein should do more than just hit a number,” Hayden says. “This shake was created to help people stay nourished through real change, whether they’re managing weight, using GLP-1s, or being more intentional about their health.

“For consumers, we’re leading with that purpose, not just the product features, but why they matter,” she explains.

“In designing the product, we focused on consumers who were on a health journey that may benefit not just from more grams of protein, but an overall product that could help support their nutrition goals. For us, that means in addition to 25 grams of plant-based protein, there’s zero grams of sugar and 160 calories, 27 vitamins and minerals to fill nutrient gaps commonly left by weight loss and GLP-1 use, and six grams of fiber to aid digestion.”

In comparison, Oikos’ new shakes have 30 grams of protein, five grams of prebiotic fiber and one gram of sugar.

“We see our new shake as complementary to other products in the [Danone] portfolio,” notes Hayden. “Together, we’re able to meet a wider range of needs and offer more people the right nutritional support—whether they’re on a personal health journey or managing a medical condition.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/07/07/kate-farms_nB27rBr.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:41.685926

McDonald's adds Daily Double burger to menu

That's not the only new thing under the golden arches. McDonald's has also added a new double burger on its menu: the Daily Double.

The Daily Double, available now nationwide, is made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices. The burger had been available in limited markets including Miami, Chicago and Seattle, but will be available nationally through 2025, the company said.

On July 22, the Daily Double will join McDonald's McValue Meal Deal options, served with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and small soft drink ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant). That menu still includes the $5 Meal Deal.

The burger is now appearing in the McDonald's app, where you can also get deals including a free medium order of fries with a $1 purchase in the app every Friday through the end of 2025.

Coming soon: the Snack Wrap

After nearly a decade, McDonald's announced the return of the Snack Wrap, one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. They're available in either Spicy (with a habanero kick) or Ranch (with Ranch dressing and hints of garlic and onion).

The Snack Wrap will be available on its own or in a combo meal featuring two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Snack Wraps will be coming back to store menus permanently beginning Thursday, July 10, the company said.

To celebrate the return of the item, McDonald's has launched snackwrapfiles.com, a website they're calling ""fans’ VIP entry to all things Snack Wrap.""

S&P Global Ratings said it’s considering cutting Centene Corp.’s credit ratings to junk, citing the health insurer’s suspending its 2025 profit outlook. Centene said last week that it was withdrawing its previous forecast for its earnings for the year, because insurance market trends were veering from its assumptions, particularly in the plans it offers under the Affordable Care Act.

Molina Healthcare became the latest health insurer to warn that higher medical costs will hit earnings this year, adding to Wall Street’s worries about an industry already facing the loss of millions of customers because of the newly passed Republican megabill. Last week, shares plunged across the industry after Molina’s larger competitor Centene withdrew its financial guidance for 2025, saying its profits would fall well short of what the company previously expected. In the wake of that, Molina’s announcement wasn’t a complete surprise, limiting the immediate downside to the shares of the California-based managed care company and its competitors.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has granted conditional approval for a proposed commercial cooperation between Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.

The approval comes after CCCS reviewed the airlines’ proposed collaboration, which involves coordination on pricing and capacity for their full-service operations — specifically on the highly trafficked Singapore-Kuala Lumpur (SIN-KUL) route.

The application was first submitted on 24 March 2023, and updated on 3 November 2023, to clarify that the cooperation applies only to the airlines’ full-service operations.

CCCS found that the cooperation could reduce competition due to coordination on pricing and seat capacity.

To address these concerns, the airlines submitted a set of commitments which include maintaining weekly seat capacity at pre-cooperation levels, proposing capacity increases only upon meeting certain performance targets, submitting annual operational data for their respective low-cost carriers on the SIN-KUL route, and appointing an independent auditor to monitor compliance with these commitments.

From February 11 to 4 March 2025, CCCS consulted industry stakeholders. No objections were raised.

CCCS also considered the upcoming exit of Jetstar Asia from the SIN-KUL route and concluded that the commitments were sufficient.

Based on this, CCCS has approved the cooperation with conditions.

In addition, the Company announced that Bradley G. Peltz has been elected to serve as a director of the Company and will replace Matthew H. Peltz, who has resigned from the Board, effective today, to devote more time to his other commitments. Winkleblack said, ""We are grateful to Matt for his many contributions to Wendy's over the years. We have made tremendous progress as a brand since Matt joined the Board, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors."" Winkleblack also said, ""We are excited to have Brad join our Board. Brad is a Managing Director of Yellow Cab Holdings, a Wendy's franchisee with restaurants in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. His creativity and connection to our customers and franchise community will provide valuable insights to Wendy's.""

Effective July 14, 2025, Chad will be responsible for overseeing the Finance function for Medtronic Diabetes and supporting initiatives aimed at accelerating profitable growth and delivering shareholder value as it prepares to become fully independent.

Chad brings over 25 years of financial leadership experience across healthcare, consumer, and industrial sectors. Most recently, he served as CFO at BIC (BB:PA), a publicly traded global consumer goods leader, where he played a pivotal role in the successful execution of the company's transformation to drive innovation, sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and shareholder value. He started his career at General Electric, where he spent a decade in management positions of increasing responsibility in corporate audit and financial planning, as well as in a senior finance role in GE Energy. Chad then assumed CFO roles at Raffaela Apparel Group (a Cerberus Capital Management portfolio company) and Slingshot Health, and held senior operational finance roles at Tenex Capital Management, a middle-market private equity firm he co-founded with over $1 billion in investments. He holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and serves on the board of directors at Stamford Hospital.

His appointment underscores our commitment to building a strong foundation for long-term success so we can continue to enhance the lives of individuals with diabetes we're privileged to serve.""

In June, Medtronic announced MiniMed as the name for the company following the intended separation. The name honors its 40-year legacy of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care to make it simpler and more accessible to the millions of people around the world with intensively managed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (or those needing daily insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels because their body doesn't produce enough insulin or isn't able to use it effectively). MiniMed's Mission is to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest.

""I'm excited for the opportunity to help shape the future of a company with such a meaningful Mission, and I look forward to working with Que and the leadership team to build a strong, agile finance organization that supports innovation, drives sustainable growth, and creates long-term value for all stakeholders,"" said Chad Spooner.

Medtronic expects to complete the separation within 18 months of the initial announcement through a series of capital markets transactions, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements including consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

Starbucks UK is reopening applications for its Accelerated Leadership Programme, a 13-month fast-track scheme aimed at turning entry-level hires into store managers.

The initiative, which coincides with the UK’s Youth Employment Week, will accept over 20 new participants this year. No previous work or hospitality experience is required.

Applications open on 7 July and close on 21 July.

Training for each participant is free, with Starbucks investing £5,000 (£100,000 in total) in their professional development.

Delivered in partnership with training provider Corndel, the programme combines hands-on experience in stores and ends with a Level 3 apprenticeship qualification, roughly equivalent to an A Level.

Graduates will also receive accreditation from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).

This is the second intake for the newly formed Accelerated Leadership Programme, with 14 partners currently progressing through the scheme after the first round of applications opened earlier this year in April.

In total, Starbucks will invest more than £170,000 across the two cohorts.

The initiative is part of Starbucks UK’s ongoing commitment to providing young people with career opportunities.

It runs alongside a year-round apprenticeship scheme offering 150 new roles across the business, from entry-level baristas to degree-level positions in the support centre.

Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law.","CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 8, 2025 – Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced plans to evaluate strategic alternatives for its Productivity Solutions and Services (“PSS”) and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions (“WWS”) businesses, which serve the transportation, warehouse and logistics markets. This enables Honeywell to further simplify its portfolio in order to accelerate value creation ahead of its planned separation into three independent, industry-leading companies, which is expected to be complete in the second half of 2026.

“Today’s announcement marks an important milestone in positioning Honeywell for success as a pure-play automation business following our planned Honeywell Aerospace separation next year,” said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. “With a simpler and more cohesive portfolio that serves the end markets of buildings, process and industrials, Honeywell will focus on our core areas of automation expertise, each of which is exposed to long-term secular growth drivers that position us as a powerful, global automation leader.”

PSS, with 2024 revenue of more than $1 billion, is a leading provider of mobile computers, barcode scanners, and printing solutions serving the warehouse and logistics market. WWS, which generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2024, is a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation projects, services and products – including automated sortation systems, palletizers, conveyors and robotics solutions as well as aftermarket services and software. WWS operates commercially under the brand names Intelligrated and Transnorm.

Kapur added: “Both leaders in their respective markets, PSS and WWS have deep customer and channel relationships, broad product offerings and innovative technologies that help improve efficiency, safety and productivity across the transportation, warehouse and logistics markets. We are encouraged by the recent performance of PSS and WWS and intend to seek opportunities to build on their unique strengths as we determine the best path forward that maximizes value for all our stakeholders.”

As Honeywell continues shaping its portfolio ahead of the planned separation, it has also appointed industry veteran Jim Masso to lead its process automation business. Masso will serve as President and CEO of Honeywell Process Automation, effective July 14, 2025. He brings 20 years of experience in energy services, engineering, operations and management, most recently as President & CEO of Allied Power Group. Prior to that, he held several senior leadership roles at General Electric and delivered transformative solutions across GE's energy portfolio.

Kapur concluded: “We are pleased to welcome Jim Masso to Honeywell to lead our process automation business. Having dedicated his career to leading complex, large-scale projects across the industry, he brings a deep understanding of the energy sector and an extensive background in driving customer-centric innovation that make him well-suited to lead this business into its next chapter of growth and innovation.”

Honeywell’s evaluation of strategic alternatives for its PSS and WWS businesses will run in parallel with ongoing portfolio workstreams and will not impact previously announced timelines for the separations of Solstice Advanced Materials by the end of 2025 or early 2026, and Honeywell Aerospace in the second half of 2026. There can be no assurance that pursuing strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other outcome.

Since June 2023, Honeywell has announced a number of strategic actions to drive organic growth and simplify its portfolio, including $14 billion of accretive acquisitions: Compressor Controls Corporation, SCADAfence, the Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, the LNG business from Air Products, Sundyne, Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies Business and Li-ion Tamer. Honeywell also completed the sale of its Personal Protective Equipment business to Protective Industrial Products in May 2025.

Honeywell has retained Centerview Partners as the company’s financial advisor to assist in assessing strategic alternatives.

Capgemini plans to acquire WNS for $3.3 billion to strengthen its business process outsourcing. The deal awaits shareholder and regulatory approvals, expected by the end of 2025. Capgemini anticipates revenue and margin growth from the acquisition. The combined entity aims to compete with major consulting firms. Concerns exist about AI's impact on the BPO sector and the acquisition's financial burden.

French IT services major Capgemini is keen on building its business process outsourcing (BPO) muscle with its latest acquisition: domain leader WNS. The deal, announced on Monday, will see the two companies pool their capabilities to address the growing enterprise demand for advanced, automated services.

Concerns, however, remain over the prospects. Analysts and investors are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the BPO sector, and the subsequent hit on revenue from the vertical. Capgemini shares reflected these worries during yesterday’s trade.

We take a look at the bones of the deal, and it's likely implications:

Capgemini-WNS deal: Key details

Capgemini had agreed to pay $76.5 for each WNS share, which amounts to $3.3 billion (about Rs 28,280 crore) in cash. This is 17% higher than the closing price of the shares on July 3. They rallied 14% on Monday.

The IT major has secured bridge financing of €4 billion to pay this sum, as well as meet some other obligations. It will refinance the bridge with €1 billion cash and the rest through debt issuance.

The boards of both companies have consented to the deal, which now awaits approval from WNS shareholders and regulators. It is expected to be closed by the end of 2025.

Capgemini expects the acquisition to immediately boost its revenue and margins, projecting a 4% rise in earnings per share (EPS) in 2026 and 7% the year after. It has projected revenue synergies between €100–140 million ($117.8–164.9 million), and an annual pretax run rate for cost and operating model synergies of between 50 million and 70 million euros by the end of 2027.

Acquiring WNS’s $1.3 billion in revenue will be a drop in Capgemini’s $25.5 billion business. It will, however, raise the headcount of the combined entity by a whopping 19%—an indication of the manual nature of WNS’s work.

Paradigm shift

The deal comes at a time when enterprises are looking to replace people-intensive business operations with AI-driven solutions for lower costs and efficient execution. Pure-play BPO companies lack the technical knowhow to address this demand, according to HFS Research founder Phil Fersht. That is a gap the Capgemini-WNS combine can capitalise on.

“By combining consulting, technology, and domain-driven BPO, Capgemini + WNS has the potential to lead AI-powered business transformation, with a robust incumbent WNS client base hungry to replace full-time equivalents (FTEs) with technology solutions,” he wrote.

The combined entity could compete on an equal footing with Accenture, and outcompete the Big 4 of consulting — PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte, Fersht noted.

""From a competitive perspective, another potential big win for Capgemini is its new positioning against the Big 4, which have traditionally dominated consulting and technology services. With WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, Capgemini could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points,"" the analyst wrote.

The flip side

Some analysts, and investors, are worried about the impact generative AI could have on the BPO sector, which Capgemini is looking to tap, noted brokerage house Morgan Stanley.

The bear case is that AI would transform BPO from a people-intensive business to one that is much more highly automated and managed by software, the brokerage noted. This could lead to a fall in BPO revenues and expose incumbent vendors to competition from new entrants, it said.

Disrupting BPO space with generative AI is an opportunity that investors might favour, but there needs to be evidence that WNS is the right vehicle for such a change, Morgan Stanley said.

Also, while WNS is unlikely to prove transformational for Capgemini’s business, the acquisition cost will weigh on the IT major’s balance sheet for a couple of years.

WNS, at a glance

Started by British Airways in 1996 as a captive unit, WNS offers BPO and data analytics services to blue-chip clients, including Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Aviva, British Gas, Virgin Atlantic Airways, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods.

It serves over 700 clients with a 64,000-strong workforce operating in 13 countries through 64 delivery centres.

WNS reported a better-than-expected but marginal 0.6% drop in revenue at $1.31 billion for fiscal year 2025, with an 18.7% operating margin. Profit increased slightly to $170.1 million, from $147.5 million the previous year. Revenue has grown by around 9% in constant currency terms, on average, over the last three fiscal years. It also acquired Kipi.ai for $63.4 million in the March quarter to expand its capabilities in data, analytics, and AI.

The IT and tech services subsector is poised for growth as businesses accelerate cloud adoption, AI-driven network automation, and edge computing deployments. While these seem like big, nebulous trends, they require very real products like switches and firewalls as well as implementation services. On the other hand, challenges on the horizon include intensifying competition from cloud-native networking providers, regulatory scrutiny over data privacy and cybersecurity, and potential supply chain constraints for networking hardware. While AI and automation will enhance network efficiency and security, they also introduce risks related to algorithmic bias, compliance complexity, and increased energy consumption.

Market Update

As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/cisco-cover-image-f37435420cb6_2025-03-04-183054_lflh.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:04.707985

These steps come amid the coffee house’s troubles with declining sales as customers become more health-conscious. CEO Brian Niccol has pledged to revamp the brand by testing and rolling out healthier products. Starbucks has not given a specific timeline for implementing these changes.

Starbucks Steps Up Rebranding Initiatives

In June, Niccol met with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss the potential for aligning Starbucks’ menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities. The HHS has specifically opposed the increasing use of seed oils in foods, including canola and soybean oil. However, there is no proven theory that prolonged consumption of these oils leads to inflammation or increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Notably, many items on Starbucks’ U.S. menu contain canola oil, such as bacon, potato bakes, and the Gouda and egg sandwich. The company has also made other health-related menu changes at its outlets, such as removing sugar from its matcha powder, a move that has, in fact, boosted sales. Similarly, the chain stopped charging extra for non-dairy milk and is testing unsweetened protein powder that can be added to any cold foam flavor.

Starbucks earns roughly 74% of its revenue from the U.S. market, making it the company’s largest contributor. Additionally, 19% of its revenue comes from Food sales. Therefore, it is important for the coffee chain to keep modifying and aligning its menu with American consumers’ shifting food preferences.

Is SBUX a Good Stock to Buy?

Analysts remain divided on Starbucks’ long-term stock trajectory. On TipRanks, SBUX stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and 11 Hold ratings. Also, the average Starbucks price target of $95.52 implies 2% upside potential from current levels. Year-to-date, SBUX stock has gained 3.9%.

How Kroger, Albertsons are moving forward following failed merger

After two years of work on a deal that would have had extraordinary scale in the grocery industry, the attempted merger of The Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. was ultimately blocked by regulators and terminated in December 2024. How has each company's operations fared following their falling-out?

On March 3, Kroger revealed the resignation of CEO Rodney McMullen after an internal investigation into his personal conduct. A company statement emphasized that McMullen's alleged breach of corporate ethics was not related to the business, including its financial performance, operations, reporting or talent.

While not quite as dramatic as the Kroger CEO departure, Albertsons also made news with its own leadership change. On May 1, Susan Morris, EVP and COO, assumed the role of CEO following the planned retirement of Vivek Sankaran. Morris also joined Albertsons' board of directors, succeeding Sankaran.

Spain: Spar wins the fight for tourists in southern Gran Canaria

More than 4,8 million tourists visit Gran Canaria each year, and nearly 70% of them are concentrated in the south of the island, especially in the municipalities of San Bartolomé de Tirajana and Mogán. In this context, Spar Gran Canaria has consolidated its leadership in sales penetration and adaptation to the tourist customer, surpassing national chains that operate with more homogeneous formulas. HiperDino is not even present in this battle.

While national retailers focus on large formats and rigid opening hours, Spar has increased its presence in tourist areas, achieving coverage that allows it to capture a large share of the market, which represents more than 60% of tourist spending on food outside hotels. This strategy has led more than 40% of foreign tourists to choose Spar for their regular shopping.

UK: Amazon expands UK grocery presence with new Gopuff partnership

From this week, Amazon customers nationwide will be able to order a wide range of groceries, snacks, drinks and household essentials from Gopuff via the Amazon website, with deliveries arriving in under 60 minutes, and as fast as 15 minutes in some areas. The launch follows a trial in Birmingham and Salford earlier this year, and marks a significant expansion in Amazon's third-party grocery proposition, with Gopuff joining existing UK partners including Morrisons, Iceland and Co-op.

To support the new launch, Gopuff is offering 50 core grocery lines price-matched to Aldi, along with promotions such as 3-for-2 on selected fresh produce, while Amazon Prime members are also being incentivised to try the service with free delivery on their first order over £20 and a 15% discount on their first six Gopuff orders.

Ireland: ""Supermarket price probe must lead to decisive action to ease costs for families""

The latest consumer watchdog probe into grocery prices must have teeth, according to Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore. Speaking ahead of the party's motion on supermarket transparency this Wednesday, Deputy Whitmore said:

""The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has re-opened a probe into grocery prices, but the government has failed to give it requisite powers to do its job. A box-ticking exercise serves no purpose for the families around the country who are struggling to make ends meet. The rise in grocery prices, in recent years, has been astronomical. Many families are now spending €3,000 more a year to put food on the table than they were in 2021.""

South Korea: Vouchers leave Korean supermarket franchise owners in the cold again

As the government prepares to distribute up to 550,000 won ($400) per person in consumer vouchers starting July 21 to spur spending and aid small businesses, supermarket franchise owners find themselves left out — again. While mom-and-pop stores and convenience store franchises will accept the vouchers, large corporate supermarkets known as Super Supermarkets (SSMs) have been excluded, a decision fueling anger among hundreds of small business owners who run these stores under big-name banners. Owners argue the policy is unfair. Unlike big-box supermarkets or company-run outlets, nearly half of all SSM branches nationwide are individually owned franchises.

South Africa: Major threat to Pick n Pay and other retailers in South Africa

Pick n Pay has warned that South African retailers face the growing threat of increased competition from the rapid expansion of the informal economy and its retail sector. In its latest annual results, the retailer outlined the country's difficult operating conditions, including low economic growth, high unemployment, inflationary pressure, and persistent infrastructure challenges.

""Consumers are increasingly price-sensitive, demanding better value and lower prices,"" Pick n Pay said, adding that the entire retail market is undergoing a ""structural shift."" This shift is being shaped by rising demand for discount and value-driven retail formats. ""Cash-strapped consumers are increasingly turning to retailers that offer low prices, trusted quality, and convenience,"" the group said.

Perfect timing Contextual advertising technology has enabled creative formats that traditional media could never achieve.
AI algorithms monitored Fortnite gameplay to detect when characters’ energy levels dropped, triggering brand messaging at the perfect contextual moment.
But when advertising becomes indistinguishable from content, through perfect contextual timing, creative work finally achieves its intended impact.
They’ll be those who understand perfect timing beats perfect creative every single time.","Traditional advertising operates on a simple premise: create compelling content, then interrupt audiences to show it. This approach built empires in television and print. But gaming audiences have systematically rejected this model.

The numbers tell the story. Sixty-six percent of gen Z actively use ad blockers. Gaming streams see 89% ad-skip rates when pre-roll interrupts gameplay. Meanwhile, the gaming market represents over £2.8bn in advertising spend annually – money largely wasted on creative that audiences actively avoid.

The problem isn’t the quality of creative work. Agencies produce brilliant campaigns daily. The problem is timing. A beautifully crafted 30-second spot becomes worthless noise when it interrupts a crucial gaming moment.

This disconnect forced our industry to confront an uncomfortable truth: context determines creative success more than content quality ever could.

Perfect timing

Contextual advertising technology has enabled creative formats that traditional media could never achieve. These aren’t minor optimizations – they’re entirely new creative possibilities that have been evolving over years of innovation.

Early experiments, such as Danone’s ‘Small Hunger’ campaign, demonstrated the potential. AI algorithms monitored Fortnite gameplay to detect when characters’ energy levels dropped, triggering brand messaging at the perfect contextual moment. This 2021 campaign generated over 650,000 views and proved that audiences would engage with advertising that felt genuinely integrated with content.

But recent campaigns have taken contextual creativity to unprecedented levels.

Take T-Mobile’s breakthrough voice recognition campaign in Poland. Instead of interrupting streams with traditional ads, the technology monitored stream audio for the phrase “the fastest network.” When streamers naturally mentioned these words during gameplay, the system automatically triggered T-Mobile-branded animations on screen.

The results defied traditional advertising metrics. Across 275 streamers, “the fastest network” became the most frequently spoken phrase in Polish gaming streams in Q4 2024, mentioned over 10,000 times organically. Brand recall increased by 11 percentage points, top-of-mind awareness grew by six points, and brand affinity jumped by 16 points – metrics that surpass most traditional TV campaigns.

The creative breakthrough wasn’t the messaging itself. The revolution was perfect timing.

Cheetos pushed contextual creativity even further with their groundbreaking ‘Chepard Game’ – the first branded game integrated directly with Twitch streams. Rather than showing standard video ads, the brand created custom software that enabled viewers to care for a virtual cheetah through chat commands during streams. This Tamagotchi-inspired experience turned advertising into collaborative entertainment.

Executed across 220 streamers, the campaign generated over 3.2m views and 50,000 viewer interactions. More importantly, it achieved a six-point brand awareness increase and an 11-point boost in perception as a brand supporting gamers. The creative content was a simple virtual pet game – the genius was contextual deployment that made advertising feel native to the streaming experience.

Memorable moments

These successes reveal three fundamental shifts marketers must understand.

Firstly, invisibility requires more creativity, not less. When audiences can’t tell they’re seeing advertising, brands must work harder to create memorable moments. Contextual campaigns demand creative thinking that goes beyond traditional formats.

Secondly, technology enables new creative formats. AI monitoring opens possibilities that human media buyers could never execute. Real-time content analysis creates opportunities for creative integration that simply didn’t exist before.

Measurement changes everything. When campaigns integrate naturally with content, traditional metrics become irrelevant. Success means tracking organic mentions, sentiment shifts, and genuine engagement rather than impressions and click-through rates.

The most forward-thinking brands now approach creativity as a timing problem rather than a content challenge. They ask: ‘When is our audience most receptive?’ instead of: ‘What should we say?’

Intended impact

Gaming represents just the beginning of contextual advertising’s creative potential. As AI technology improves, brands will soon execute contextual campaigns across podcasts, social media, and even traditional television.

The fundamental lesson transcends gaming: audiences will always choose content over advertising. But when advertising becomes indistinguishable from content, through perfect contextual timing, creative work finally achieves its intended impact.

Brands investing in contextual technology today aren’t just optimizing campaigns – they’re preparing for an advertising future where context determines creative success. In this future, the most creative brands won’t be those with the biggest budgets or flashiest executions. They’ll be those who understand perfect timing beats perfect creative every single time.

The gaming industry taught us this lesson first. Smart marketers will apply it everywhere else.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/356431/gaming.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:46.044934

With 76% of healthcare providers reporting feeling overwhelmed by the pace of innovation, the index offers critical insights into the barriers physicians face when translating breakthroughs into clinical practice. Naumovic outlined how J&J is using these findings to drive meaningful support for oncologists—through enhanced research access, community-based care models, responsible integration of AI, and targeted efforts to reduce cognitive burden across the care continuum.

Pharmaceutical Executive: If the Oncology Care Index were revisited two years from now, what progress would you hope to see—and how is J&J working to help realize that vision?

Biljana Naumovic: Fast forward a few years, and I’d really like to see measurable progress in the key areas we've identified. First and foremost, I hope to see a decrease in the levels of overwhelm reported—particularly by supporting community oncologists with earlier access to information and research engagement.

We're also focused on improving care transitions for patients across institutions, wherever Johnson & Johnson can play a supportive role. Another important goal is increasing the involvement of advanced practice providers and nurses in care delivery—whether in oncology, urology, or other community settings.

These are all areas we’re actively working on. In the disease areas where Johnson & Johnson is directly involved, I’m optimistic that we’ll see meaningful improvements in how care is delivered—making the process more seamless and straightforward for both physicians and patients.

Full Interview Summary: Johnson & Johnson (J&J) launched the Oncology Care Index to better understand the mounting pressures oncologists face amid rapid innovation—highlighting that 76% of healthcare providers feel overwhelmed. In 2024 alone, the FDA approved 50 new indications and 11 new molecular entities, underscoring the urgent need to translate breakthroughs into practical care. J&J uses the index not as a self-promotional tool but as a catalyst for industry-wide dialogue around care delivery, implementation of innovation, and systemic barriers.

Two insights from the index stood out: the difficulty community oncologists face in accessing clinical research and the fragmentation in the continuum of care as patients transition between treatment centers. To address these, J&J is expanding access to community-based clinical trials and co-developing protocols with community providers, particularly in areas like multiple myeloma and lung cancer. They're also pushing for policy changes that support non-academic trial sites. At the same time, the company is investing in training and infrastructure to ensure continuity of care and appropriate treatment closer to patients’ homes.

J&J sees artificial intelligence (AI) as a major opportunity to alleviate provider burden but acknowledges that true adoption requires collaboration across the ecosystem. The company is leveraging AI to improve trial recruitment and streamline decision-making but stresses the need for open, connected databases and industry-wide alignment.

To combat burnout and cognitive overload, J&J is focused on delivering timely, contextualized education and CME programs, supporting advanced practice providers and nurses, and enhancing patient support services.

Looking ahead, J&J hopes to see decreased provider overwhelm and more seamless integration of innovation into care, driven by empowered community oncologists, improved transitions of care, and greater engagement of frontline healthcare workers in both research and treatment delivery.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmexec/80ee8398991bb2a0ac850aea6706537b131c5eae-1280x720.png?rect=0,30,645,606&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-08 08:01:29.987262

As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data.
Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.
He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector.
The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent.","Disclosure pop-ups about the “cookies,” or other aggregate bits of data websites collect and store aren’t an uncommon experience while shopping online. What’s less common: when a pop-up indicates that your potential purchase of condoms, birth control medication or menstrual hygiene products is being noted digitally, a message Virginians have started seeing when they shop virtually for such products.

Since July 1, a new state law outlines that people’s personally identifiable reproductive or sexual health information cannot be obtained, disclosed, disseminated or sold without consumer consent. As new laws took effect in Virginia on July 1, Walmart has begun alerting customers about certain product or service searches and purchases.

“By viewing, searching for, or buying these products or services on our site, or using related features such as the Baby Registry, you consent to our use of this information to complete your purchase, provide the requested feature, and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention,” a pop-up disclaimer now notifies people who visit Walmart’s website from within Virginia.

If consumers don’t want their data connected to their sexual or reproductive health to be stored, the disclaimer suggests they “avoid viewing, searching for, using or purchasing these products, services, or features.”

But not all pop-ups are new or specifically focused on reproductive-related information. Other retailers like CVS have more broad disclaimers about data collection. Its site explains that information collected about consumer behaviors is used “to provide our products and services recommendations, understand how you engage with our site, and improve the services we offer you.”

It also warns that it may share data with “trusted third parties” that include marketing, analytics and research “partners.”

This sort of data collection is a common practice in e-commerce and is a catalyst for targeted advertisements that people experience elsewhere on the internet, like their social media feeds or when using search engines.

As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data.

Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, have introduced and supported legislation to shore up these protections.

Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.

“I don’t think a lot of people realize the information that private industry buys and sells about them,” he said in a recent call.

He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector.

“I was concerned that attorneys generals in some other states who want to be more aggressive about prosecuting women or other people for helping women cross state lines to obtain either contraception or abortion services might use information that the private sector has in order to reverse engineer women and other people to prosecute,” Surovell said.

Surrovell and Favola also worked on bills to prevent menstrual data from being subject to search warrants, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law. Last year, Youngkin was lambasted by many, including former President Joe Biden and talk show host Stephen Colbert, for opposing the same bill in a previous legislative session.

“It should go without saying that when a woman has her period or visits a doctor, it is nobody’s business but her own,” Favola said earlier this year.

As more pregnant people travel to get abortions outside states where the medical procedure is banned or restricted, some states — including Alabama and Texas — have threatened legal repercussions for people who leave the state for an abortion, and for those who aid them.

This year Favola’s Senate Bill 754 passed the Democrat-controlled legislature and Youngkin signed it. The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent.

Walmart’s interpretation of the law prompted the pop-up disclaimer, and other companies will find their own way to follow suit.

“The companies are trying to figure out how to implement the bill,” Favola said in a text message.

Next, Favola wants to explore how to further refine the bill to ensure people’s identifiable information is protected.

“I made it clear that the law is focused on individually-identifiable data — not aggregate data,” she explained. “I expect to make some revisions next session.”

Further details will be discussed in a workgroup later this summer, she said.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-11.59.26-AM.png,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:00.416292

Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Julie Creswell report for The New York Times.

In short:

Companies including Kraft Heinz, Nestlé, and PepsiCo have agreed to remove petroleum-based dyes from processed foods by 2026, but Mars, which makes M&M’s, has not joined the initiative.

Industry advocates cite technical and economic hurdles to replacing synthetic dyes, including cost, supply limitations, and consumer preference for bright colors in candy.

Some states are stepping in with policies to ban or label products with artificial dyes, with West Virginia and Texas introducing regulations starting in 2027 and 2028.

Key quote:

“If people are celebrating and eating treats, they don’t want to be tasting beets.”

— Kirk Vashaw, CEO of Spangler Candy

Why this matters:

Synthetic food dyes, found in many brightly colored candies and cereals, have long been controversial. A growing body of research, including reviews by California health agencies, links some of these dyes to behavioral issues in children, especially those with ADHD. Red Dye No. 3 has already been flagged as a potential carcinogen. While Europe has restricted or banned many of these additives, U.S. regulations have lagged behind, leaving American consumers — especially children — more exposed. The stakes are high: Nearly one in five processed foods contain synthetic dyes. As federal efforts rely on voluntary compliance, states may play a larger role in shaping the food supply and protecting public health.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61170826/origin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:16.033957

In parallel, Nike also expects a slight price increase in the United States starting next fall season.
One of the first companies to react was Hermès, which in mid-April announced price increases for its products starting in May.
This increase, however, will be on the company’s sales in the United States, precisely to compensate for the extra cost of bringing the merchandise into the country.
The conglomerate, in the hands of French businessman Bernard Arnaud, explained in mid-April its plans to move part of its production to the United States, where it already operates up to three plants.","The reciprocal tariffs announced by Donald Trump in April have hit fashion, which has its largest consumer market in the world in the United States and the largest concentration of its value chain in Asia. Three months later, the president of the American power has announced a new zero day for the entry into force of these levies, and that they will not catch fashion off guard on August 1. What have luxury, footwear and large retailers done so far to prepare for the tariff wave?

In 2024, the United States imported finished fashion, textiles and leather goods worth $147.488 billion, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Administration. Of all the goods purchased by the U.S. from the rest of the world, fashion accounted for 4.5% of the total last year.

A large part of these imports, moreover, come from textile hubs in Asia, where fashion accounts for a large part of the supply chain: China alone exported fashion to the United States for a value of $31,861 billion. From the reorganization of the supply chain announced by giants such as Nike to the price hikes proposed by Hermès, the fashion industry has had 90 days to prepare for an impact on fashion purchases abroad of almost 150 billion dollars, and the companies in the sector have not wasted the room for maneuver.

The United States imported fashion for almost 150 billion dollars in 2024

Large-scale distribution and footwear

The first companies to react were the large chains, which accumulate in the United States a significant weight of their income statements, and especially those of U.S. origin, which are more exposed to an increase in tariffs on trade with Asia. The latest was Nike, the U.S. footwear giant, which during the presentation of its annual results for 2024 estimated an impact of 1 billion on its gross costs.

During the conference with analysts, the company already announced the first measures planned to avoid the impact of the escalation, including reducing its sourcing from China from the current 16% to a single digit figure. In parallel, Nike also expects a slight price increase in the United States starting next fall season.

If the latest announcement has come from Nike, the shoe company Steve Madden or the Kontoor Brands group, both American, were among the first to announce their strategy to the possible new trade order. The path differs between the two companies: while Steve Madden announced back in February a price increase planned also for part of the fall-winter catalog and relocation of part of the value chain, Kontoor, owner of brands such as Lee, opted to maintain its production in Mexico, already with an eye on a possible compensation of the impact in 2026.

Nike was the last company to implement a strategic plan to avoid the tariff impact

Also in the group of U.S. companies, Ralph Lauren, Gap and Victoria’s Secret have estimated an impact on the companies’ financial results for this year. Although the three companies expect the tariff policy to have an impact of between $50 million and $150 million, only Ralph Lauren has commented on a possible strategy, whereby it plans to reduce its sourcing from any country, including China, to less than 20%.

Gap, on the other hand, which in the worst-case scenario could suffer an added gross cost of up to $300 million (or 150 million less in operating income), not only did not announce possible containment measures, but assured that it would maintain its repositioning strategy in Old Navy, Banana Republic and Gap.

On the other side of the ocean, the second-largest retailer H&M was another company to announce a sourcing strategy in the face of rising tariffs. At the end of March, on the occasion of the analyst conference following the first quarter results, the group’s chief financial officer, Adam Karlsson, already announced some relocation of sourcing to markets with “less tariff impact”. The company has also announced “price positioning”.

Puma, for its part, the second largest German group in the fashion and sports equipment sector, has also anticipated a tariff hit on its business. In the last results presentation, in fact, the company had already reduced to 10% its items exported to the United States directly from China, a figure it plans to reduce further. In their place, however, other hubs such as Vietnam and Cambodia, which also face a possible high tariff from the United States, have been gaining weight, which has led the company not to rule out a possible price increase.

The luxury sector has opted to raise prices rather than redistribute the chain

Luxury

This repositioning, which in practice translates into an increase in the final price of products, is the strategy that has dominated among luxury companies in particular. One of the first companies to react was Hermès, which in mid-April announced price increases for its products starting in May.

This increase, however, will be on the company’s sales in the United States, precisely to compensate for the extra cost of bringing the merchandise into the country. The decision of H&M or Nike to relocate their supply chain to other countries with less impact is even more complicated in the luxury sector, which often depends on the know-how of small textile hubs and artisans.

It was under this premise that Kering defended its 2025 strategy, whereby it ruled out moving part of the chain to the country North America. We are selling parts of our culture, of the Italian or French culture,“ explained the group’s CEO, François-Henri Pinault, “so we have no intention of responding to the measure”.

Different has been the strategy of LVMH, the other major competing luxury group with brands such as Dior in its portfolio. The conglomerate, in the hands of French businessman Bernard Arnaud, explained in mid-April its plans to move part of its production to the United States, where it already operates up to three plants. This strategy is not new within the group, which during Trump’s first term consolidated part of these factories in the country, specifically, a factory in Texas, which involved an investment of $50 million.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6ImRldjE3NTE5ODAxNTMifQ/files/2025/redaccion-personas/donald-trump/trump-bandera-julio25-1200.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 09:09:15.750944

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday adjusted an earlier tariff hike announced in April, lowering it slightly from 37 percent to 35 percent on Bangladeshi textile and garment imports. While still steep, it marks a slight reprieve from what industry leaders describe as a looming crisis.

“We are hopeful of a reduction,” said Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, confirming that the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has sent a new draft for review. “Our national security adviser and commerce adviser are working on the issue in Washington,” he added.

Garment sector on edge

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024—primarily clothing—while importing just $2.21 billion. President Trump has repeatedly cited this trade imbalance as justification for imposing tariffs that are more than double the existing 16 percent levied on cotton products.

The proposed tariffs have rattled an industry still recovering from last year’s student-led revolution that toppled the previous government. Interim Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus is expected to raise the matter directly with US officials.

“This is a big challenge for the garment sector,” said Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). “We had expected something closer to 10-20 percent.”

Economic fallout looms

Leading US brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp (which owns Vans, Timberland, and The North Face) rely heavily on Bangladeshi suppliers. Industry stakeholders worry the tariff increase could make Bangladesh less competitive globally and trigger job losses.

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned that the impact could be severe. “The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,” he said. “Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.”

In a bid to ease trade tensions, Dhaka has proposed to purchase Boeing aircraft and increase imports of US wheat, cotton, and oil.

As the August 1 deadline set by the Trump administration nears, all eyes in Bangladesh’s export-driven economy remain fixed on Washington—hoping that diplomacy and trade ties can prevent a major blow to one of the world’s largest garment-producing nations.",https://d2udx5iz3h7s4h.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/1751971708688-1zrlf9-1c5eb77f02926ea8dcd19e260b1e77dc19c1b4d0c5a3e8084a56cb88cc487ad0.jpeg?width=512&format=jpg&quality=80,N,,2025-07-08 12:23:11.011628

Final Call: A Portfolio Must-Have The liquid handling systems market isn't just growing—it's evolving into a $7 billion+ tech ecosystem where precision and automation are non-negotiable.","The global liquid handling systems market is on the brink of an explosive growth phase, driven by the twin engines of automation and genomics. Valued at $4.34 billion in 2024, the sector is projected to surge to $6.75 billion by 2030, riding a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.64%. This isn't merely an expansion of lab equipment—it's a revolution in precision, efficiency, and innovation. For investors, this is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to stake a claim in a market where drug discovery, personalized medicine, and high-throughput screening are rewriting the rules of science.

The Automation-Genomics Synergy: A $7B Gold Rush

The heart of this boom lies in two unstoppable trends:

1. Automation's Rise: While automated liquid handling systems dominate labs, the manual method segment is growing at a blistering 8.75% CAGR, driven by smaller labs and emerging markets seeking cost-effective solutions. Companies like Agilent and Eppendorf are now offering hybrid systems that bridge the gap—think semi-automated pipettes or cloud-enabled manual dispensers.

2. Genomics' Explosion: Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS) and gene-editing tools like CRISPR demand ultra-precise liquid handling for sample prep. The genomics sector alone accounts for $1.2 billion in annual demand, with North America's pharma/biotech giants (e.g., Pfizer, Moderna) fueling this fire.

Why North America is the Engine, and Asia-Pacific is the Accelerator

North America: Already commands ~30-40% of the global market, thanks to $126 billion+ in annual biotech/pharma R&D spending and initiatives like the NIH's Precision Medicine Program. Labs here are early adopters of cutting-edge tools like Agilent's BioTek MultiFlo FX or Eppendorf's epMotion 5077p.

Asia-Pacific: Set to grow at the fastest regional CAGR (9.82%), driven by India's Genome India Project, China's $200 billion “Healthy China 2030” plan, and Japan's $1.2 trillion investment in life sciences. This is where Agilent's and Eppendorf's partnerships with local labs will pay dividends.

Agilent vs. Eppendorf: Who's Leading the Charge?

Both companies are category kings, but their strategies differ in critical ways:

Agilent Technologies (A): The Automation Titan

Strengths:

Owns BioTek Instruments, a leader in microplate dispensers used in NGS workflows.

Launched the 406 FX Washer Dispenser (2023), a game-changer for labs needing high-throughput plate washing.

Leverages AI-driven software like OpenLab Enterprise for lab automation workflows.

Growth Levers:

Drug Discovery Dominance: Captures 60% of the market in systems for ADME/Tox studies.

Global Footprint: 45% of revenue comes from Asia-Pacific, where it's expanding partnerships with contract research organizations (CROs).

Eppendorf AG (EPP.DE): The Precision Specialist

Strengths:

epMotion Series: Automated liquid handlers with error rates below 0.1%, critical for genomics.

Semi-Automated Innovations: Products like the Lambda EliteMax make automation accessible to smaller labs, addressing the $100k+ price barrier of full systems.

Growth Levers:

Emerging Markets Play: Secured exclusive distribution rights in India and Southeast Asia via partnerships like SLS.

Cost Efficiency: Offers modular systems that scale with lab budgets, ideal for Asia-Pacific's growing biotech hubs.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Leaders—Now

The data is clear: Agilent and Eppendorf are the only pure-play liquid handling giants with R&D pipelines, global scale, and genomics expertise to capture this boom. Here's why investors should act:

Valuation Edge:

Agilent trades at 14.5x forward earnings, below its 5-year average of 18x, despite a 25% CAGR in biotech sales.

Eppendorf's stock has underperformed in 2023 (down 12%) due to macroeconomic jitters, creating a buying opportunity ahead of its Asia-Pacific ramp-up.

Moats and Momentum:

Agilent's $200M/year in R&D ensures it stays ahead in AI-integrated systems.

Eppendorf's 500+ patents (including dispensing tech) shield it from generic competitors.

Risk-Adjusted Upside:

Even if growth slows to 6% CAGR, Agilent's biotech division alone could deliver $2B in revenue by 2030.

Eppendorf's niche focus on cost-effective automation gives it a 15% market share target in Asia-Pacific by 2026.

Final Call: A Portfolio Must-Have

The liquid handling systems market isn't just growing—it's evolving into a $7 billion+ tech ecosystem where precision and automation are non-negotiable. Agilent and Eppendorf are the only two names with the scale, innovation, and geographic reach to dominate this space.

Action Items for Investors:

- Aggressive Buy: Agilent (A) at current valuations.

- Accumulate: Eppendorf (EPP.DE) ahead of its Q3 2025 Asia-Pacific sales report.

- Avoid: Smaller players without genomics-specific pipelines (e.g., Tecan) or those overexposed to manual systems alone.

The next five years will separate the lab equipment suppliers from the genomics-era winners. Don't miss the boat.

The acquisition creates a €23.3 billion entity targeting what both companies call “intelligent operations”: business processes managed by AI systems that can make decisions and adapt without human oversight.

The death of traditional outsourcing

“Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end,” says Aiman Ezzat, CEO of Capgemini. “Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI. Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly-emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations.”

The deal reflects a shift in how companies approach business process outsourcing. Traditional labour-intensive services are being replaced by AI-driven automation that promises not just cost savings but transformational business outcomes. Companies that once sought cheap offshore labour now demand intelligent systems that can adapt, learn and operate with minimal human oversight.

WNS, which generated US$1.266 billion in revenue last year serving clients including United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, maintaining constant currency revenue growth of 9% annually over three years and projecting growth of 7% to 11% for fiscal year 2026.

“As a recognised leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients,” says Keshav Murugesh, CEO of WNS. “Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core – shifting from automation to autonomy.”

Capgemini’s AI ambitions

The acquisition addresses Capgemini’s need for scale in the US market while providing access to WNS's industry-specific platforms and domain expertise. Aiman has invested heavily in AI capabilities, establishing 25 strategic partnerships with technology providers including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and Nvidia. The company says it reported over €900 million in generative AI bookings during 2024.

Market analysts including Forrester, IDC and ISG have recognised Capgemini’s position in the AI services market. Aiman has developed training programmes and AI-focused service offerings to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered business transformation.

Capgemini expects the transaction to generate revenue synergies of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027, alongside cost synergies of €50 million to €70 million annually. Aiman anticipates 4% accretion to normalised earnings per share before synergies in 2026, rising to 7% post-synergies in 2027.

Enabling next-generation, data-driven operations

The transaction requires approval from the Royal Court of Jersey and WNS shareholders, alongside regulatory clearances. Both companies’ boards have unanimously approved the acquisition, with closing expected by the end of 2025.

“By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini’s global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention,” says Keshav. “WNS’ complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini’s rapidly-growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.”

The companies expect immediate cross-selling opportunities through the integration of complementary client bases and service offerings, supported by what they describe as natural cultural alignment and shared values.

“Just as importantly, our shared values, cultural alignment and complementary client relationships ensure a seamless integration – unlocking exciting opportunities for innovation, co-creation and growth across all stakeholder groups,” says Keshav.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0666516a6ed09917e8760a14652a3e8c:05a15ea78f107ef709c56890dfad46d7/handshake-blue-line.webp.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:21:24.924896

Here's what to expect: Amazon expanded Prime Day this year because shoppers “wanted more time to shop and save,” Amazon Prime Vice President Jamil Ghani recently told The Associated Press.
Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures but said last year that the event achieved record global sales.
For the big event, Amazon said it would have special discounts on Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV and Fire tablets.
Some third-party sellers are expected to sit out Prime Day and not offer discounts to preserve their profit margins during the ongoing tariff uncertainty, analysts said.","NEW YORK -- Amazon is extending its annual Prime Day sales and offering new membership perks to Generation Z shoppers amid tariff-related price worries and possibly some consumer boredom with an event marking its 11th year.

The e-commerce giant's promised blitz of summer deals for Prime members starts at 3:01 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. For the first time, Seattle-based Amazon is holding the now-misnamed Prime Day over four days; the company launched the event in 2015 and expanded it to two days in 2019.

Before wrapping up Prime Day 2025 early Friday, Amazon said it would have deals dropping as often as every 5 minutes during certain periods. Prime members ages 18-24, who pay $7.49 per month instead of the $14.99 that older customers not eligible for discounted rates pay for free shipping and other benefits, will receive 5% cash back on their purchases for a limited time.

Amazon executives declined to comment on the potential impact of tariffs on Prime Day deals. The event is taking place two and a half months after an online news report sparked speculation that Amazon planned to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its website.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced the purported change as a “hostile and political act” before Amazon clarified the idea had been floated for its low-cost Haul storefront but never approved.

Amazon's past success with using Prime Day to drive sales and attract new members spurred other major retail chains to schedule competing sales in July. Best Buy, Target and Walmart are repeating the practice this year.

Like Amazon, Walmart is adding two more days to its promotional period, which starts Tuesday and runs through July 13. The nation's largest retailer is making its summer deals available in stores as well as online for the first time.

Here's what to expect:

Amazon expanded Prime Day this year because shoppers “wanted more time to shop and save,” Amazon Prime Vice President Jamil Ghani recently told The Associated Press.

Analysts are unsure the extra days will translate into more purchases given that renewed inflation worries and potential price increases from tariffs may make consumers less willing to spend. Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures but said last year that the event achieved record global sales.

Adobe Digital Insights predicts that the sales event will drive $23.8 billion in overall online spending from July 8 to July 11, 28.4% more than the similar period last year. In 2024 and 2023, online sales increased 11% and 6.1% during the comparable four days of July.

Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, noted that Amazon's move to stretch the sales event to four days is a big opportunity to “really amplify and accelerate the spending velocity.”

Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights and strategy at software company Salesforce, noted that July sales in general have lost some momentum in recent years. Amazon is not a Salesforce customer, so the business software company is not privy to Prime Day figures.

“What we saw last year was that (shoppers) bought and then they were done, ” Schwartz said. “We know that the consumer is still really cautious. So it’s likely we could see a similar pattern where they come out early, they’re ready to buy and then they take a step back.”

Amazon executives reported in May that the company and many of its third-party sellers tried to beat big import tax bills by stocking up on foreign goods before President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect. And because of that move, a fair number of third-party sellers hadn't changed their pricing at that time, Amazon said.

Adobe Digital Insights' Pandya expects discounts to remain on par with last year and for other U.S. retail companies to mark 10% to 24% off the manufacturers' suggested retail price between Tuesday and Friday.

Salesforce's Schwartz said she's noticed retailers becoming more precise with their discounts, such as offering promotion codes that apply to selected products instead of their entire websites.

Amazon Prime and other July sales have historically helped jump-start back-to-school spending and encouraged advance planners to buy other seasonal merchandise earlier. Analysts said they expected U.S. consumers to make purchases this week out of fear that tariffs will make items more expensive later.

Brett Rose, CEO of United National Consumer Supplies, a wholesale distributor of overstocked goods like toys and beauty products, thinks shoppers will go for items like beauty essentials.

“They're going to buy more everyday items,” he said.

As in past years, Amazon offered early deals leading up to Prime Day. For the big event, Amazon said it would have special discounts on Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV and Fire tablets.

Walmart said its July sale would include a 32-inch Samsung smart monitor priced at $199 instead of $299.99; and $50 off a 50-Inch Vizio Smart TV with a standard retail price of $298.00. Target said it was maintaining its 2024 prices on key back-to-school items, including a $5 backpack and a selection of 20 school supplies totaling less than $20.

Independent businesses that sell goods through Amazon account for more than 60% of the company's retail sales. Some third-party sellers are expected to sit out Prime Day and not offer discounts to preserve their profit margins during the ongoing tariff uncertainty, analysts said.

Rose, of United National Consumer Supplies, said he spoke with third-party sellers who said they would rather take a sales hit this week than use up a lot of their pre-tariffs inventory now and risk seeing their profit margins suffer later.

However, some independent businesses that market their products on Amazon are looking to Prime Day to make a dent in the inventory they built up earlier in the year to avoid tariffs.

Home fragrance company Outdoor Fellow, which makes about 30% of its sales through Amazon's marketplace, gets most of its candle lids, labels, jars, reed diffusers and other items from China, founder Patrick Jones said. Fearing high costs from tariffs, Jones stocked up at the beginning of the year, roughly doubling his inventory.

For Prime Day, he plans to offer bigger discounts, such as 32% off the price of a candle normally priced at $34, Jones said.

“All the product that we have on Amazon right now is still from the inventory that we got before the tariffs went into effect,” he said. “So we’re still able to offer the discount that we’re planning on doing.”

Jones said he was waiting to find out if the order he placed in June will incur large customs duties when the goods arrive from China in a few weeks.

Havas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.
“Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.” Dallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with OpenAI to support client-facing work and internal tooling.
These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.
In a recent investor note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver.","OpenAI is everywhere, but that might be a problem for the AI startup’s revenue expansion plans.

As it seeks to diversify its income, OpenAI has been courting ad agencies over the last two months, sometimes requesting sizable upfront commitments in exchange for deeper partnerships, as well as inking direct corporate enterprise deals.

But, agencies’ existing relationships with Microsoft, which has an exclusive deal with OpenAI, could undermine the AI startup’s ability to cut those deals.

“The convergence of OpenAI’s advanced generative AI capabilities with Microsoft’s expansive and integrated Azure ecosystem poses potential challenges for OpenAI in attracting direct enterprise deals with specific segments, including ad agencies,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK.

In at least one recent negotiation, OpenAI sought a $1 million upfront commitment in exchange for annual joint projects and expanded tool licenses, according to a holding company executive who requested anonymity to protect industry ties.

“OpenAI is trying to find the right commercial model,” the executive said. “[But asking for $1 million upfront], that’s not how you build relationships.”

The price tag prevented the agency from formalizing any direct partnership, especially since their existing agreement with Microsoft already provides access to the same models with fewer legal hurdles. Ultimately, the agency rejected the deal because it felt out of step with how other tech platforms, such as Google and Meta, can bundle in free media to longer-term deals, thereby offsetting the costs of AI tools.

OpenAI did not respond to a media request.

Havas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.

To scale AI use internally, the agency is talking with training companies like Section AI to teach employees model-specific best practices and prompt engineering across multiple AI models.

“With big [AI] providers, their number one goal is the sale of licenses,” Dan Hagen, global chief data and technology officer, Havas, told ADWEEK. “Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.”

Dallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with OpenAI to support client-facing work and internal tooling. In return, the independent shop gets access to OpenAI’s tools, including Sora and Dall-E, data security, and the ability to build and white-label bots for client use. The financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but it is structured as an annual agreement, paid monthly. LERMA is also evaluating Azure, weighing features and costs before finalizing its decision.

Laurie Evans, media technology principal at LERMA, notes that other AI providers, including Microsoft’s Copilot, are offering similar enterprise-level packages.

“As an independent agency, we don’t have the resources of big holding companies that can throw a lot of money at innovation,” said Pedro Lerma, founder and CEO, LERMA. “We’re building bots for our workflow on a daily basis—that’s what’s standing out to me about OpenAI,” she added.

OpenAI’s changing revenue structure

To keep revenue growing—and amid its push for profitability under an unorthodox corporate structure—OpenAI began promoting its enterprise offerings in August 2023. These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.

As of June, OpenAI said it was signing about nine enterprise contracts per week and had reached 3 million business users across those tiers. OpenAI is reportedly charging at least $10 million, offering AI customization and consulting services.

OpenAI has doubled its annual recurring revenue, from roughly $5.5 billion last year to $10 billion in June. Yet the San Francisco‑based firm still lost nearly $5 billion in 2024, underscoring the high infrastructure and operational costs of powering generative AI. For now, its revenues come largely from premium ChatGPT subscriptions, like ChatGPT Pro, priced at $200 a month, and API usage (ads may be coming to ChatGPT).

Even so, chief executive Sam Altman recently posted on X that OpenAI is “losing money” on ChatGPT Pro subscriptions, adding that he personally set the price assuming “we would make some money.”

Now, OpenAI is turning its attention to ad agencies, striking enterprise deals and deeper partnerships.

Agencies’ relationship with Microsoft

Through Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI, which integrates OpenAI’s IP, including models and infrastructure, into products like Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant) and Azure (its cloud computing platform), certain agencies can already access OpenAI’s tools without signing up and paying for a direct enterprise deal. That access lets them use OpenAI for image and video generation or call the API to build agents, according to sources, all within Microsoft’s ecosystem.

Without a direct relationship with OpenAI, agencies do miss out on enterprise-level perks, like 24/7 support, live training, custom bot deployments, or immediate access to OpenAI’s latest tools, which reportedly takes weeks before showing up in Microsoft software.

Gartner estimates ChatGPT Enterprise costs between $40 and $60 per user per month, higher than Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is typically priced at $30 and often bundled with other Microsoft products. These estimates are based on Gartner’s Digital Workplace Maturity Assessment Tool, which surveyed IT leaders on their digital transformation priorities. OpenAI did not respond to comments on competitive pricing.

“The pricing structures, security assurances, and integrations provided by Microsoft, such as Azure AI Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot, align with enterprise operational requirements and risk management protocols,” Greene said. “[These are] compelling reasons for ad agencies to work with Microsoft instead of making a direct enterprise deal with OpenAI.”

Meanwhile, OpenAI announced last month that it would shift its ChatGPT Enterprise plan from a pricing-based model to a credit-based system where companies can purchase usage credits based on demand rather than paying fixed per-seat pricing.

Microsoft, for its part, is seeing clear returns from its integration with OpenAI. In a recent investor note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver. Analysts now expect Azure to grow at a 33% compound annual rate through 2028, up from an earlier 27% estimate.

“Contribution from OpenAI is significant and understated in our original framework,” the note read, pointing to Microsoft’s 20% revenue share from OpenAI, along with additional income from fine-tuning and post-training services.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/openai-microsoft-ambitions-2025.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:14.275151

Spicy twist on a breakfast classic

Starting on Tuesday, July 8, the fast food chain will roll out three spicy Egg McMuffin options: Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The Egg McMuffin was first introduced in 1972 and by 1975 had become a breakfast staple for those choosing to eat out first thing in the morning. 50 years later, it’s still going strong.

Why spice up the anniversary with McDonald’s new Spicy Pepper Sauce, the key ingredient to the three new options? McDonald’s says it’s responding to demand, with surveys showing that 78% of Gen Z loves spicy flavors and 74% of Americans add hot sauce to meals.

The return of the Snack Wrap

Additionally, the company has also brought back its Snack Wrap, which was a customer favorite up until 2016, when it was dropped from the menu because of equipment and preparation constraints.

The Snack Wrap comes in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy, both of which use McCrispy chicken strips, lettuce and shredded cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla.

How long will they be available?

McDonald’s has stated the new Egg McMuffins will be on the menu for a limited time, so act fast if you’d like to give it a try.

Unlike the Egg McMuffin, the Snack Wrap will stay on the menu for as long as it’s selling well and customer interest is there. Judging by its first run, it’s unlikely to be going anywhere anytime soon.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-07-08 10:03:31+00:00,Modern Retail,What Albertsons is looking to learn from its test run of in-store digital displays in two markets,Mitchell Parton,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/what-albertsons-is-looking-to-learn-from-its-test-run-of-in-store-digital-displays-in-two-markets/,"Albertsons is among a growing number of retailers experimenting with in-store signage as an element of their growing advertising businesses.
“This is all-new, bleeding-edge, I would say, hot-off-the-press types of technology,” Roche said.
At the end of last year, Iowa-based regional grocer Hy-Vee added 10,000-plus in-store screens across more than 400 locations.
“2025 is the tipping-point year of in-store RMN pilots,” said Sean Cheyney, head of retail media at Vistar Media, an out-of-home advertising firm.
He expects to see more widespread adoption of in-store digital signage within the next year and a half.","Albertsons is among a growing number of retailers experimenting with in-store signage as an element of their growing advertising businesses. And, given Albertsons reach — more than 2,200 stores in 35 states — it’s an important validation point. Still, like many other retailers doing pilot programs this year, Albertsons has yet to determine how quickly to scale up the program and how it will measure the efficacy of the technology in generating revenue and profits moving forward.

“We’re taking this pilot as an amazing opportunity to learn. When it comes to in-store, digital screen networks, there really isn’t a playbook,” Roche said, referring to the fact that while there are many case studies about other formats like search ads, there hasn’t yet been a widespread rollout of digital screens at U.S. retailers. “It’s not like we can say, ‘OK, let’s just rip the page out of the textbook. We’ll rinse and repeat and we’ll apply it.’ … We’re really taking this pilot as an incredible opportunity to learn, to tweak, to optimize and to continue rapid expansion.”

Not just ads, but also informational content

The company is adding television screens to key areas of each store such as the entrance, the produce department, the meat department and the center of the store. The screens will display both advertiser content and informational content. For example, in the produce department, a customer could spot a 15-second video on what to do with radishes. Roche said a playlist of ads alone wouldn’t be an ideal shopping experience, so the company is looking at how to optimize content to both enhance the shopper experience and drive growth for suppliers.

“We have a tremendous amount of people who are coming to a store every week. Bringing them excellent content and maybe helping them think outside the box and giving them that inspiration really enables a full-funnel experience for both our advertisers and for our shoppers,” Roche said. “[Brand marketers] are excited to have some space to play to build that affinity. … Learning how to make a seven-layer dip and what chips to use for such a substantial dip is a really great brand moment where brand marketers can build affinity.”

The first brand partners include snack and beverage company Mondelēz, as well as non-endemic brands such as PayPal.

“I think the level of attention you have from a shopper when they’re in store is high. People are alert. They’re looking at the shelves. They’re making real-time decisions,” Roche said. “In such an attention economy that we’re working in, our non-endemic brands are really leaned into trying to add to that journey, whether that’s in the [fintech] space or elsewhere.”

Roche said the genesis of the program was the retailer’s large amount of store traffic, having 36 million people in its stores every week and 45 million loyalty members.

“That traffic is really valuable,” Roche said. “Our shoppers love being in the store, so by enhancing their in-store experience and enhancing their shopper experience, but also helping to get our supplier partners ingrained in that shopping experience and giving brand marketers opportunities to really tell big stories in store, it’s really an incredible canvas.”

The quest for measurement

Ultimately, Roche said the goal of the test is to figure out how to close the loop through measurement technology.

“By introducing more technology, we can start to understand things like, ‘Is this individual ad working?'” Roche said. “We’re able to get a lot more granular and move more into causation and move away from correlated results. That’s what we’re aiming to do, and frankly, that’s what our suppliers want … They want attributed impressions. They want to understand exactly how every impression is driving their business forward, and we want to be able to deliver that.”

Roche said that could include sensor technology to understand exact efficacy of each screen, dwell time and served impressions while maintaining privacy, though the company declined to share exactly how it would accomplish that.

“This is all-new, bleeding-edge, I would say, hot-off-the-press types of technology,” Roche said. “It takes some calibration. It takes partners who want to say, ‘Hey, I’m willing to learn with you all,’ which makes us really lucky in this space, because we have those partners.”

The year of digital signage pilots

Several other major grocers have recently launched digital signage pilot programs in the same vein. Kroger announced in June that Barrows Connected Stores was building a new platform for the retailer to deliver animated content in its stores, integrated onto shelves, endcaps or other locations throughout each store. At the end of last year, Iowa-based regional grocer Hy-Vee added 10,000-plus in-store screens across more than 400 locations.

“2025 is the tipping-point year of in-store RMN pilots,” said Sean Cheyney, head of retail media at Vistar Media, an out-of-home advertising firm. “Everybody’s realizing that this is something they need to do. … The retail media teams are really driving this, because they’re running out of inventory on their owned-and-operated [online] assets.”

Like Albertsons, retailers are generally looking at the best play to manage and expand the screens, how many to put in and how it fits into the broader store strategy, he said. Measurability is a big component to these tests: Most commonly, screens have had little to no way of measuring success of ads. Now, he said, grocers are using platforms like Circana, Inmar or LiveRamp that they’ve been using elsewhere in the store for measurement to determine the ROAS of what’s happening on the screen. Like what Albertsons is experimenting with, sensors can also be used to measure impressions.

He expects to see more widespread adoption of in-store digital signage within the next year and a half.

“It always drives me nuts when [retailers] look at it in a silo, which is the way [in-store] has been for a long time,” he said. “Now they’re looking at it and saying, ‘How can this fold into the greater retail media ecosystem?’”

Still awaiting ‘the killer campaign’

Sean Turner, CTO of retail media tech platform Swiftly — which has worked on retail media platforms for California-based grocery chain Save Mart, as well as Oklahoma-based chain Homeland — also admitted the technology is still in early days.

“I don’t think, as of yet, we’ve really seen the ‘killer campaign,’ or the killer setup where all of the necessary elements come together and just blow away what we’ve been doing in the paper world,” Turner said.

That campaign, Turner said, would ideally start long before a shopper gets to the store, making sure they know about the brand through platforms such as web ads, connected TV or linear TV, as well as on-platform retail media like video in retailer apps. The video could link to recipe ideas that use the product or nutritional information, as well as a coupon. That would get a customer in the store, where they would see in-store videos with quick clips that remind customers of what the product is and how to use it. That would draw attention to the product in the store, where the customer would find something like a QR code driving them back to that offer they saw earlier online.

“The shopper is going to make up their mind as to whether or not they’re going to buy the product, or at least get most of the way there, before they get in the stores,” Turner said. “You have to do that work before they get in.”

He said once retailers and CPG brands figure out how to best use the medium, he expects more rapid adoption, going from the pilots of a few stores or a few markets to every store within a grocery banner. Still, he said such programs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per store, so it could be a few years before the technology is affordable enough for grocers to make the plunge, as well.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 09:07:54.602805

This move is in response to the European Commission’s decision in June 2025 to exclude Chinese companies from EU government purchases of medical devices exceeding 5 million EUR.
For non-EU enterprises participating in government procurement projects, the proportion of medical devices imported from the EU that they provide should not exceed 50% of the procurement’s total contract amount.

China’s Ministry of Finance has announced that it will take ‘relevant measures’ against medical devices imported from the European Union (EU) through government procurement projects. This move is in response to the European Commission’s decision in June 2025 to exclude Chinese companies from EU government purchases of medical devices exceeding 5 million EUR.

With the new restrictions imposed in China, when a purchaser buys medical devices with a budget of over 45 million CNY (about 5.34 million EUR at the time of writing) if it is indeed necessary to purchase imported products — after going through relevant legal procedures — the participation of EU enterprises (excluding EU-funded enterprises in China) should be excluded, the ministry said.

For non-EU enterprises participating in government procurement projects, the proportion of medical devices imported from the EU that they provide should not exceed 50% of the procurement’s total contract amount.

The above measures do not apply to procurement projects that can only be met by medical devices imported from the EU, according to the ministry.

This notice came into effect on July 6, 2025. For procurement projects that have already announced winning bids or transaction results before July 6, the above measures don’t apply and government procurement contracts may continue to be signed.

With regards to the EU ban announced in June, a spokesperson from the ministry claimed that China had repeatedly expressed through bilateral dialogue its willingness to resolve differences with the EU via such dialogue, and through consultation and bilateral government procurement arrangements.

The spokesperson for the ministry said that despite China’s ‘goodwill and sincerity,’ the EU has insisted on taking ‘restrictive measures’ to build new ‘protectionist barriers.’

“Therefore, China has no choice but to take reciprocal restrictive measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and maintain a fair competition environment,” said the spokesperson.

The ministry emphasised that China’s measures only apply to medical device products imported from the EU, and those produced by EU-funded enterprises in China are unaffected.",https://med-techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/china-and-eu-8th-july-1024x536.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:36.864368

Impact and consequences for Burger King This strategic move comes at a complicated time for Burger King in the United States.
While McDonald’s expands their offerings and updates their menu, Burger King hasn't replied with similar innovations in their morning menu.
Meanwhile, Burger King will have to rethink their strategy in order not to fall behind in the breakfast battle in the United States.","In the competitive world of fast food, chains are constantly seeking to innovate in order to attract customers. It's not common for McDonald’s to make major changes to their breakfast menu, since their classic products are usually well received. However, this time the situation has changed and the company has decided to take a step that could mark a turning point.

McDonald’s has just launched three new versions of their iconic McMuffin, adding a spicy touch that hasn't been seen before in their morning offerings. This new development comes at a time when the competition, especially Burger King, is facing a tough blow in the United States.

McDonald’s spicy bet revolutionizes breakfast in the United States

McDonald’s has added three new varieties to their breakfast menu, which until now had remained quite stable. The new Spicy McMuffins include the Spicy Egg McMuffin, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with egg. The key is the special spicy sauce that's added to these sandwiches, an exclusive blend that delivers an intense flavor and an extra spicy kick.

This spicy sauce is already used in other menu items, such as the Spicy McCrispy and, soon, in the Spicy Snack Wrap that's returning on July 10, according to All Recipes. With this addition, McDonald’s expands their range of products with a bold flavor, designed to attract spice lovers and those seeking new breakfast experiences.

Previously, McDonald’s had experimented with jalapeños in their breakfasts, but they'd never included their own spicy sauce in a product as classic as the McMuffin. This innovation not only refreshes the menu, but also attracts a younger and more dynamic audience.

Impact and consequences for Burger King

This strategic move comes at a complicated time for Burger King in the United States. While McDonald’s expands their offerings and updates their menu, Burger King hasn't replied with similar innovations in their morning menu. The introduction of these Spicy McMuffins has caused a considerable increase in consumer interest toward McDonald’s, leaving their rival with fewer options to compete.

In addition, the launch campaign has been supported by the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the McMuffin. This has given a special context to this update. This combination of tradition and innovation strengthens McDonald’s's position in a market where breakfast is one of the most important time slots.

Although the new sandwiches will be available only for a limited time, the expectation and demand have been very high. Customers are taking advantage of the opportunity before these products disappear from the menu, which is causing long lines in many locations.

McDonald’s has managed to leverage their legacy and add a bold twist that allows them to keep their leadership strong.

Why it matters: Low- and middle-income consumers have been increasingly shying away from fast-food restaurants like McDonald's, a sign that people are watching their budgets amid recession fears.

U.S. comparable sales fell 3.6% at McDonald's during its first quarter, the chain said in May, which was company's worst showing since the pandemic.

The big picture: Reviving fan-favorite items or adding limited-time offerings can help restaurants drive sales and bring consumers back.

Starbucks announced Monday that its new Strato Frappuccino blended beverages debut nationwide Tuesday.

Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches out Tuesday

The intrigue: McDonald's Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches debut Tuesday at participating restaurants nationwide.

There are three varieties with the chain's Spicy Pepper Sauce — Spicy Sausage, Spicy Egg Cheese and the Spicy Sausage Egg Cheese McMuffin.

The new breakfast addition comes after McDonald's and Krispy Kreme ended their doughnut partnership effective July 2.

When does the McDonald's Snack Wrap come back

Zoom in: McDonald's Snack Wrap will come back starting Thursday, July 10 as a permanent menu item. It uses the new McCrispy Strips that rolled out to restaurants in early May.

McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski has said the launch of new chicken strips and the return of snack wraps should help the company's sales improve.

The Snack Wrap will be available in two flavors — spicy and ranch.

Popeyes and other restaurants have also launched their own chicken wraps, which appears to be the next battle in the Chicken Sandwich Wars.

How much does Snack Wrap cost

By the numbers: McDonald's said the Snack Wrap is priced at $2.99 and is available to order from 10:30 a.m. through late night at participating restaurants.

The wraps can be ordered on the app, restaurant and drive-thru.

The original McDonald's Snack Wrap debuted in 2006 and was discontinued in 2016.

Daily Double joining McDonald's McValue menu

What's next: Starting July 22, the Daily Double will be a new entree option in McDonald's McValue Meal Deal bundle.

It will be priced at $6 or $7 depending on location, the company said.

McDonald's rolled out its McValue menu in January after it introduced the $5 meal deal last summer, which has been extended multiple times.

Zoom out: The Daily Double is a more premium burger than the basic McDouble double cheeseburger, which is also on the McValue menu.

The Daily Double has two patties, cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, slivered onions and mayo.

The McDouble and McChicken will continue to be on the McValue menu, McDonald's said on its new menu item spotter website.

Hazy IPA has added £1.4m by filling a gap in an alcohol-free beer segment currently dominated by lager.","Low & no-alcohol remains a growing opportunity that major drinks companies can ill afford to ignore.

That much is clear from the latest supermarket data, which shows low & no beer growing 22% year on year, while the total beer category remains near-flat [Circana 12 we 14 June 2025]. Some 76% of UK adults are actively moderating their alcohol consumption and low & no products are one of the main ways they are choosing to do it.

This trend – which has been in motion for at least a decade – prompted an early flurry of M&A from major spirits companies keen to protect themselves against declining booze consumption. Diageo was an early advocate, backing Seedlip and Everleaf through its Distill Ventures incubator. Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard worked with the founders of Ceder’s to bring the non-alcoholic gin alternative to market in 2018, before taking a majority stake in the business in 2021.

Fast-forward to 2025, however, and the landscape looks very different. Multinational drinks companies have developed and launched 0.0% abv versions of their best-selling brands, backing them with major focus and investment. Meanwhile, brands like Seedlip, Ceder’s and Everleaf have seen off-trade sales slump as the major mults delist them in favour of more recognisable alcohol-free versions of household names.

So, why are standalone low & no brands no longer seen as a growth opportunity for drinks majors, and what does that mean for the future of challenger brands in the segment?

How drinks brands hedged their bets

When the low & no category was in its infancy, multinationals understandably wanted to ‘test the water’ with low-risk investments while waiting to see how sustained the moderation trend was likely to be.

By backing early-stage startups, Diageo and Pernod were able to hedge their bets by ensuring they had a stake in the nascent but growing low & no segment, while also protecting their reputation if the products didn’t meet consumers’ expectations. Seedlip was marketed as a non-alcoholic alternative to gin, but nobody bought it expecting it to taste like a Gordon’s or a Tanqueray.

Then – once they were confident they had the formula right – Diageo launched Gordon’s 0.0% in 2020, followed by Tanqueray 0.0% in 2021, and Captain Morgan Spiced Gold 0.0% in 2023. Pernod is now preparing to do the same with Beefeater 0.0%.

It was a similar story in beer – Budweiser Brewing Group initially dipped its toes with Budweiser Prohibition in 2017, while Asahi added Peroni Libera in 2018. Both were axed and replaced by Budweiser Zero and Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0% once alcohol-free brewing technology had sufficiently advanced, and low & no sales had shown little sign of slowing down.

What has happened to Seedlip?

These alcohol-free versions of well-known brands have been backed with large-scale marketing investment – Peroni 0.0%, for example, is the alcohol-free beer partner of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 team, while Captain Morgan 0.0% and Gordon’s 0.0% have both appeared in TV advertising.

Predictably, therefore, they’ve come to dominate supermarkets’ low & no aisles and driven much of the growth of the category. Just 12 of the 75 low & no-alcohol products on sale in Sainsbury’s are made by dedicated alcohol-free drinks brands. Meanwhile, just one of the top 10 fastest-growing low & no products – Lucky Saint’s Hazy IPA – is from a brand that doesn’t also operate in booze [NIQ 52 we 17 May 2025].

By contrast, the dedicated low & no brands backed by major multinationals have been left on – or in some cases knocked off – the shelf. Seedlip was last seen in Sainsbury’s in May 2024, and Tesco in 2023 [Assosia]. It remains stocked by Waitrose and Ocado, but sales have declined by 37.6% to £758k in the last year [NIQ 52 we 19 April 2025].

Everleaf and Ceder’s – the latter of which appears destined for the Pernod Ricard scrapheap – have mustered less than £50k between them.

Why 0.0% variants are taking off

Diageo and Pernod Ricard remained tight-lipped when The Grocer asked about their plans for Seedlip and Ceder’s, but it makes sense they would want to shift focus towards 0.0% versions of their big-name brands.

While health and wellbeing are major drivers for moderation, consumers report not wanting to feel left out at social occasions as a reason for choosing alcohol-free beers and spirits over soft drinks. By offering consumers brands they know and trust, drinks companies like Diageo and Pernod can keep moderating drinkers in their portfolio.

As one senior drinks industry executive put it when quizzed last week: “It’s a much easier sell-in if they already know the brand and the product – you don’t need to explain it to them.”

Despite the dominance of 0.0% abv variants, there are still several challenger brands making headway in the alcohol-free segment. For example, Lucky Saint has added £2.3m and is now worth £8.9m [NIQ]. Meanwhile Botivo, which only made its grocery debut in January, had amassed £180k in sales by April.

In the case of Lucky Saint, success has been driven by the launch of new variants like Hazy IPA and Lemon Lager. Hazy IPA has added £1.4m by filling a gap in an alcohol-free beer segment currently dominated by lager. Similarly Botivo’s botanical non-alcoholic aperitif offers a point of difference in a low & no spirits category stacked with gin alternatives. Both brands have also made a point of emphasising the positive case for choosing alcohol-free in their marketing, rather than framing not drinking as a compromise.

If challengers are to survive in a competitive landscape increasingly dominated by major players, this looks like the blueprint for how to do it.",https://dmrqkbkq8el9i.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/9/7/363797_gordonszeropercent_78967_crop.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 07:04:49.918131

This strategic partnership positions Firestorm as the only provider of HP’s high-performance 3D printers designed for mobile and field-deployable environments, creating new possibilities for on-demand production in remote locations.

The collaboration represents a fundamental shift in how commercial, humanitarian, and medical sectors can respond to urgent needs in challenging environments. By combining HP’s established 3D printing expertise with Firestorm’s mobile manufacturing platform, organisations can now produce critical components precisely where and when they’re needed, without relying on traditional supply chains that may be disrupted or unavailable.

The xCell Expeditionary Manufacturing System

At the heart of this partnership is Firestorm’s xCell system, an expeditionary manufacturing platform housed within two expandable 20-foot containers that can be transported and deployed worldwide. The system is designed with versatility in mind, capable of operating on various power sources including standard generators, battery backup systems, or conventional power networks. This flexibility makes the xCell particularly valuable in remote settings such as forward operating bases, disaster zones, or areas with limited infrastructure.

The integration of HP’s Multi Jet Fusion technology into the xCell system significantly enhances its capabilities. MJF is a powder-based 3D printing technology that creates highly durable parts with consistent mechanical properties. Unlike traditional manufacturing that requires extensive tooling and setup time, MJF can produce complex components on demand. This technology enables the xCell to manufacture mission-critical parts and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in real-time at the point of need, dramatically reducing response times in critical situations.

Creating Resilient Global Production Networks

Firestorm’s approach aims to establish a distributed and resilient global production network that fundamentally changes how manufacturing responds to logistical challenges. By deploying xCell units strategically around the world, customers can access regional and localised supply chains that adapt quickly to shortages, reduce delivery times, and allow for rapid modifications to products that would otherwise have lengthy lead times.

The concept addresses a persistent problem in global logistics: the vulnerability of centralised manufacturing and extended supply chains. When political instability, natural disasters, or other disruptions affect traditional supply routes, expeditionary manufacturing provides an alternative production method. The system’s ability to operate in contested logistics environments—areas where traditional supply routes are compromised or unavailable—makes it particularly valuable for defence, disaster response, and humanitarian operations.

The partnership between HP and Firestorm extends beyond technology to include significant workforce development opportunities. As the demand for mobile manufacturing solutions grows, the collaboration will create new high-tech jobs across multiple fields, including system operations, maintenance, field deployment, and drone manufacturing.

Next week, McDonald's is launching three spicy breakfast menu items: the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The McMuffins will feature their traditional ingredients – cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, a news release states.

McDonald's launched the Egg McMuffin in 1975. The breakfast item was the brainchild of Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California. Herb, according to previous USA TODAY reporting, presented the sandwich as a to-go version of a diner classic: Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

The company’s services “will be the showcase for agentic AI,” Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in the firm’s statement on Monday.
WNS shares jumped 14% to $74.62 a share in New York trading, more than a dollar below the offer price.

The French group said it will take over the US-listed firm for $76.50 per share, a premium of about 28% to WNS’s average price over the past 90 days. Capgemini expects the deal to close by the end of the year, pending approvals, and to boost its earnings per share by about 4% on a normalized basis in 2026, it said in a statement on Monday.

Capgemini shares fell 5.6% in Paris on Monday. The acquisition reignited investor concerns that AI tools will reduce the need for IT and system-integration services and give rise to rivals that use the technology to deliver at much lower costs, Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday. There are already signs that AI is bringing down the costs of consulting — and in some cases, the prices that consultants charge, too.

For its part, Capgemini said it plans to use the WNS acquisition to transition into an “agentic AI-powered intelligent” operation. The company’s services “will be the showcase for agentic AI,” Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in the firm’s statement on Monday.

The acquisition will also increase Capgemini’s exposure to the US market, and Ezzat said in an interview that it expands the company’s “expertise and technology.”

WNS’s products help businesses perform data analysis, manage shipping and routing, automate travel booking and predict how customers will behave. The company serves more than 600 clients and operates in 13 countries, according to its website. In April, it reported better-than-anticipated quarterly earnings, though revenue declined slightly.

Capgemini’s $3.3 billion bid for WNS Holdings looks like a strategic bet on enterprises leaning on low-cost implementers to design and run AI agents, yet business-process-service disruption means expected revenue and profit synergies might not materialize, said Tamlin Bason, industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Yet Capgemini could boost US exposure and end-to-end transformation project competitiveness.

WNS shares jumped 14% to $74.62 a share in New York trading, more than a dollar below the offer price. The shares have gained 57% this year.

Talks about a combination earlier this year were interrupted due to uncertainties around tariffs, Bloomberg had reported.

IT services firms from Capgemini to Accenture Plc are spending heavily on artificial intelligence, which companies around the world are racing to adopt. Capgemini said in the statement that the biggest opportunity for its customers to get value from AI is the “fundamental redesign of their operations and business practices.”

Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, has launched VARIPULSE™ Platform in Asia-Pacific to perform Cardiovascular Solutions.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is Johnson & Johnson MedTech's Pulsed Field ablation system. The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) system fully integrated with the CARTO™ 3 electroanatomical mapping system, designed to drive efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy. The VARIPULSE™ Platform is approved in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Taiwan and Korea in Asia Pacific. With this Platform is now approved for use in the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada.

Catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by extra, uncoordinated electrical signals in the atria will be performed by using this platform. AFib is associated with structural changes in the heart due to underlying conditions and lifestyle factors. It significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first PFA technology designed to streamline ablation and mapping through a single integrated workflow with the CARTO™ 3 System. This 3D electroanatomical cardiac mapping technology enables real-time visualization and supports precision, efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy for physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). It enables safe and efficient patient-centric therapy with minimal to no fluoroscopy exposurex and is compatible with deep and/or conscious sedation.

Philip McDaniel, CEO and co-founder of the award-winning St. Augustine Distillery, has retired.

Well known for his advocacy for sustainable production and modernizing antiquated distillery regulation laws, the 30-year St. Augustine resident is passing the torch his co-founders to spend more time with his family.

McDaniel told the St. Augustine Record that as retirement feels surreal, he remains “blown away” by the cool idea ― the distillery ― that became one of Florida’s top attractions and the state's largest craft spirit's brand.

“I feel good about it all,” he said. ""We poured our time, energy and heart to achieve becoming respected and engaged. We didn’t just seek profits — we sought to create purpose. We built something that helps take care of people, both in the company and throughout our community.""

Known for his mentorship, advocacy and community give-back, McDaniel said that despite stepping back from the daily operations, he remains a “passionate” supporter of the craft spirits movement and the future of St. Augustine Distillery.

Over the past 12 years, McDaniel and his team have acquired a long list of accolades. Last year, the distillery received USA Today's Reader's Choice Award for the 2024 Best Craft Specialty Spirits.

Additional awards include:

“#1 Whiskey Tour in North America” by the Drammie Awards.

A gold medal for its Florida Double Cask Bourbon.

A platinum medal for its Port Finished Bourbon from the Spirits International Prestige Awards.

A 2014 Award for Excellence for Reuse and Repurpose by the Urban Land Institute of North Florida for the renovation of the Ice Plant.

And the 2014 Adelaide Sanchez Award for Historic Preservation, Restoration, Education and Interpretation.

The distillery treats more than 175,000 annual guests to award-winning whiskey, bourbon, rum, gin, vodka and moonshine. McDaniel and his team spearheaded the renovation of the St. Augustine Distillery, which is nestled in Florida's oldest FP&L Ice Plant. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the evolution of the 1917 ice plant to become a distillery took more than three years.

""Finding a home with lots of soulful character that would be big enough to house a working distillery ― while also being convenient to visit – was no small task,"" McDaniel told the St. Augustine Record in December. ""We lovingly restored this piece of history so it could serve the community for the next century.""

The distillery boasts a culture for community give-back with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, The St. Johns County Cultural Counsel, the Lincolnville Museum and Cultural Center, the St. Augustine Amphitheatre, the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall, and music festivals such as Sing Out Loud and Fort Mose Jazz and Blues Concert Series.

As a well-respected voice in the industry, McDaniel served on the board of directors for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Visit Florida's board and multiple terms — including as chairman — on the St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra & The Beaches Visitors & Convention Bureau, promoting regional tourism and entrepreneurship.

“I’m grateful to our shareholders, our incredible team, our industry partners, and the 1.5 million guests who’ve visited and supported us,” he said in a public statement.” I’m excited to support our leadership team — Mike Diaz (CFO) and Will Hensler (COO) and Rick DeMontmollin — in my new role as Founder Emeritus.”

The facility—now the largest iron ore concentrator in West Africa—is expected to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output.
Lakshmi Mittal remarked that the concentrator “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” solidifying the country’s role as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.
“This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” said President Boakai.
ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and has created more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two decades in the country.","ArcelorMittal Liberia has officially inaugurated a state-of-the-art iron ore concentrator at its Tokadeh mine in Nimba County, marking a major milestone in Liberia’s mining sector and broader post-war economic transformation.

The facility—now the largest iron ore concentrator in West Africa—is expected to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output. It represents the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a $1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total stake in Liberia to approximately $3.5 billion.

The inauguration ceremony, attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai and ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, highlighted the project as one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war. President Boakai hailed the development as a “turning point” in Liberia’s industrial future and a testament to the country’s stability and resilience.

The new concentrator is designed to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade hematite ore (~35% Fe content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate using advanced beneficiation technology. The upgrade adds significant value before export, aligning with Africa’s broader push toward value addition and industrialization. “The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai stated.

Echoing the African Union’s vision for mineral-led development, ArcelorMittal’s investment demonstrates how resource-rich African nations like Liberia, and by extension Ghana and others, can leverage natural wealth to drive homegrown industrial transformation. Lakshmi Mittal remarked that the concentrator “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” solidifying the country’s role as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

In parallel with boosting output, ArcelorMittal’s expansion also emphasizes infrastructure development. The company has modernized the 243-kilometer railway linking Tokadeh to the port of Buchanan, laying hundreds of thousands of new sleepers, enhancing track geometry, and installing new passing loops to accommodate long, heavy trains. These upgrades elevate Liberia’s mining corridor to meet international standards and lay the foundation for regional integration.

Crucially, ArcelorMittal supports an open-access policy for the railway, collaborating with the Liberian government to develop a framework allowing other mining companies to utilize the infrastructure under fair agreements. This creates the potential for Liberia to serve as a regional mineral hub, with iron ore from neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone possibly routed through Liberia’s enhanced logistics network in the future.

President Boakai emphasized the strategic importance of these projects, stating they are “essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people.”

The Phase II expansion has already delivered significant socioeconomic impact. During the construction phase, over 5,000 jobs were created—most of them filled by Liberians. Now operational, the concentrator is expected to support around 1,000 permanent roles in mining, rail, processing, and port operations. “This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” said President Boakai.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and has created more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two decades in the country. To ensure lasting benefits, the company has expanded its Training Academy in Yekepa, offering a fully funded, multi-year technical training program. Dozens of young Liberians are being trained in mechanical, electrical, and processing disciplines to run the new concentrator. “They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai noted.

Local businesses have also benefitted, with Liberian contractors engaged in civil works, transportation, and support services—stimulating local economies across Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

With future expansion in mind, ArcelorMittal has built infrastructure capable of handling up to 30 million tonnes of iron ore annually, beyond the initial 20 Mt target. Officials have hinted at a phased ramp-up and plans for a pelletizing plant, potentially adding more in-country processing and helping West Africa gain a stronger foothold in the global steel supply chain.

On the community front, ArcelorMittal contributes around $3 million annually to a Community Development Fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihoods in host communities. President Boakai underscored the importance of corporate responsibility: “Large investments must enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope… so that communities feel the benefits not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets.”

The successful commissioning of the Tokadeh concentrator underscores what’s possible when stable policy, infrastructure investment, and community engagement align. “We would not have invested this scale of capital—nearly $3 billion—if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” said Lakshmi Mittal, signaling ArcelorMittal’s long-term confidence in the nation.

Beyond Liberia, the project holds regional significance. Its alignment with continental initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) showcases how integrated infrastructure corridors can drive industrialization and trade across borders. The emphasis on beneficiation and skills development reflects Agenda 2063’s goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

For other resource-rich African nations—including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Ghana—Liberia’s model offers valuable lessons: local processing and infrastructure investment can multiply the economic impact of natural resources and position Africa not only as a source of raw materials, but as a leader in global value chains.

In conclusion, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress—symbolizing resilience, ambition, and meaningful partnership. As Liberia prepares to export its first high-grade iron ore from the facility later this year, a powerful message resonates across the continent: Africa is open for business—and ready to transform its natural wealth into lasting prosperity.",https://www.adomonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PHOTO-2025-07-07-07-47-26-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 03:58:03.857981

This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns among patients and healthcare providers.
This trend raises questions about the long-term sustainability of obesity treatment and the need for more data on the long-term effectiveness and value of GLP-1 medications [1].
In conclusion, CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from coverage has sparked debate and concern among patients and healthcare providers.","CVS' anti-theft measures may be alienating customers and harming profits more than the theft itself, according to liberal columnist Matt Bai. The drugstore chain has experienced a rise in organized theft in recent years, prompting the implementation of barriers to protect merchandise. Bai argues that these barriers have altered his relaxing shopping experience and may be driving customers away.

CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager, has announced significant changes to its prescription drug plans, including the exclusion of Eli Lilly's Zepbound from coverage for chronic weight management, effective July 1, 2025 [1]. This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns among patients and healthcare providers.

Zepbound, a GLP-1 drug approved for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or who are overweight, will no longer be covered under CVS Caremark's most common formulary template, which represents between 25 and 30 million individuals [1]. The change is aimed at encouraging competition among drug manufacturers to lower prices and improve patient access to more affordable alternatives, such as Wegovy from Novo Nordisk [1]. However, the exclusion of Zepbound has been met with criticism from patients and healthcare professionals who argue that the medication is more effective and better tolerated than Wegovy for many individuals [1].

The trial-and-error process required to find the right medication for each patient can be disrupted by insurance coverage changes, leading to potential setbacks in weight loss progress and increased stress for patients [1]. Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, has expressed frustration with the impact of insurance coverage changes on patient care and the time burden it places on healthcare providers [1].

Moreover, the exclusion of Zepbound from coverage may have unintended consequences for patients' mental health, as weight stigma and bias can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety [1]. Tara Eacobacci, a patient who has benefited from Zepbound, has described feeling validated by the medication and concerned about the potential impact of losing coverage on her physical and mental well-being [1].

In response to the coverage change, Eli Lilly has expanded access to Zepbound through its LillyDirect platform, offering single-dose vials at $499 per month for patients who pay out-of-pocket [1]. However, the appeals process for coverage exceptions can be time-consuming and frustrating for patients [1].

The insurance coverage changes are part of a broader trend of exclusions and restrictions on GLP-1 medications for obesity treatment, with BCBS Massachusetts planning to exclude all GLP-1s from coverage for obesity treatment in January 2026, except when indicated for type 2 diabetes [1]. This trend raises questions about the long-term sustainability of obesity treatment and the need for more data on the long-term effectiveness and value of GLP-1 medications [1].

In conclusion, CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from coverage has sparked debate and concern among patients and healthcare providers. While the goal of encouraging competition and lowering drug prices is commendable, the impact on patient care and well-being must be carefully considered. As the obesity crisis continues to be a significant public health challenge, it is essential to ensure that patients have access to effective and affordable treatment options.

Washington Post contributing columnist Matt Bai argued Monday that the drugstore chain’s efforts to prevent rising theft may be killing profits more than theft itself.

""As you might have read, CVS and other pharmacies have been struggling to contain a rise in thefts by gangs of fast-moving thieves. Unfortunately for CVS, the solution might be worse for business than the organized shoplifting,"" he wrote.

In recent years, CVS and other similar drug stores have experienced a rise in frequent, organized theft, especially in major U.S. cities where crime has risen.

CREW OF ARMED GUNMEN ROB ARMORED TRUCK OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO-AREA BANK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

For example, a group of dozens of school-age kids routinely ransacked and looted a CVS in Washington, D.C.’s Columbia Heights neighborhood throughout 2023.

""A big group of kids, like 45 or more, walk in before school, after school and late at night to steal chips and drinks,"" Fox 5 reported in October that year. ""They even throw the food and beverages on the ground and stomp on them, leaving behind a big mess.""

A recent survey by the National Retail Federation found that 70% of retailers believe organized retail theft has become a more prevalent issue in recent years. As a result of these and similar crimes, big chain stores like CVS and others have been forced to lock up merchandise behind glass and plastic barriers to keep it from being stolen off the shelves.

But the Washington Post columnist complained that these barriers have altered his ""relaxing"" CVS shopping experience.

""I come back not just because it’s convenient but because it’s relaxing. I like to roam the deserted aisles at night and consider the myriad ways in which the bounty of 21st-century pharmacology might improve my life. What if my hands could truly be moist? Which combination of vitamins might heighten my chances of grasping string theory?"" Bai asked.

""Except now I’m standing in front of the oral care aisle, and something has changed,"" he continued. ""Virtually all of those mysterious products are now encased in glass. It’s like someone has turned the CVS I knew into a Museum of the American Pharmacy; the only thing missing from the lifelike diorama is a wax employee with a pricing gun.""

He mentioned feeling the ""pressure"" of having a store clerk open an enclosure just so he could look at a product he hadn’t decided on buying while she stood there next to him. He also mentioned how when he had to return products later, he was asked if he had opened them. When he said no, he noted the cashier ""cheekily"" asked, ""Are you lying?""

""I should probably be offended by this, but I’m not. If body lotion is so valuable that it has to be kept in a glass vault, then I guess it’s reasonable to wonder what kind of game I’m running. Plus, I seem suspiciously well hydrated,"" he remarked, before delving into what has caused this new atmosphere in CVS.

""A little research tells us what’s going on here. As you might have read, CVS and other pharmacies have been struggling to contain a rise in thefts by gangs of fast-moving thieves. Unfortunately for CVS, the solution might be worse for business than the organized shoplifting,"" he said, adding, ""According to a recent survey, less than 1 in 3 shoppers at CVS are willing to hang around once they realize that the item they want is behind glass.""

Bai noted that this is hard for the store combined with the fact that ""plenty of online sites"" are offering the same products ""more cheaply and just as reliably,"" and stated that the chain should lean into what makes it unique.

""What your neighborhood chain can offer is the chance to wander down an aisle and suddenly find some new, cucumber-scented solution to a problem you didn’t even know you had. It’s the possibility store.""

The price represents a 28% premium over WNS’ 90-day average share price, and values the transaction at approximately $3.3 billion, excluding net debt.

The deal, unanimously approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors, will position Capgemini as a global leader in Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations. It is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and shareholder consent.

Strategic Move to Tap the Agentic AI Opportunity

“Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI,” said Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini. “This acquisition gives us scale and sector expertise to lead the transformation from traditional BPS to AI-powered Intelligent Operations. With deep consulting, platform, and technology capabilities, we are poised to deliver efficiency and superior business outcomes for clients globally.”

WNS, with its high-growth, margin-accretive Digital BPS model, will enhance Capgemini’s U.S. exposure and unlock cross-selling opportunities. “I look forward to welcoming the WNS global team to Capgemini,” Ezzat added.

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, noted, “The next wave of transformation lies in intelligent, domain-centric operations that shift from automation to autonomy. Our integration with Capgemini allows us to combine deep domain expertise with Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, unlocking strategic value for clients and stakeholders alike.”

WNS Chairman Timothy L. Main called the deal “a pivotal chapter” in the company’s growth journey, stating, “Capgemini is the ideal partner to extend our capabilities, accelerate innovation, and create lasting value for clients, investors, and employees.”

WNS: A High-Quality, Resilient BPS Business

WNS brings strong fundamentals, with a diversified client base across eight industries and a highly automated delivery model. The company achieved a compound annual revenue growth of 9% (constant currency) over the past three fiscal years, reaching $1.27 billion in FY2025 with an 18.7% operating margin.

Its robust operating model, including non-linear pricing and recurring revenue streams, positions it well to benefit from the global shift to Intelligent Operations.

Unlocking Cross-Selling and Revenue Synergies

The combination will yield €1.9 billion in 2024 revenue in Digital BPS alone. Capgemini expects €100–140 million in annual revenue synergies and €50–70 million in operating model efficiencies by end-2027. Normalised EPS is projected to increase by 4% in 2026 and by 7% in 2027 post-synergies.

Agentic AI: A Paradigm Shift in Process Transformation

Intelligent Operations, driven by Agentic AI and Generative AI, is expected to dominate enterprise AI investments. Capgemini and WNS together offer consulting-led transformation of both horizontal and vertical processes, using hyper-automation, AI, and data integration to deliver speed, agility, and improved outcomes.

This shift from labour-intensive models to tech-led, outcome-driven services opens significant growth opportunities in a rapidly evolving market.

Combined Strengths to Lead in Intelligent Operations

Capgemini brings consulting, technology, and platform integration at scale, while WNS contributes industry-specific solutions, a proven delivery model, and recent AI advancements (including its acquisition of Kipi.ai). Capgemini’s 25 strategic AI partnerships—including Microsoft, AWS, Google, NVIDIA, and Mistral—further enhance the combined capabilities.

Together, the companies aim to lead the emerging Intelligent Operations space and become transformation partners to enterprises seeking AI-powered reinvention.

Transaction Structure and Financing

The acquisition will be implemented via a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Jersey law. Capgemini has secured €4 billion in bridge financing to fund the purchase price, existing debt, and a recently redeemed €0.8 billion bond. The bridge will be refinanced using a mix of available cash and new debt.

Q2 and H1 2025 Guidance Unchanged

Capgemini expects Q2 2025 constant-currency revenue growth to slightly exceed Q1’s -0.4% and maintains its H1 operating margin at 12.4%. Full H1 results will be announced on July 30, 2025.

2025 Outlook (Excluding Acquisition Impact):

Revenue growth: –2.0% to +2.0% (constant currency)

Menu additions include the Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.
Its enduring popularity has helped define McDonald's breakfast offering for half a century.
For long-time customers, the spicy Egg McMuffin and returning Snack Wrap offer a mix of familiarity and novelty.","McDonald's has announced two major menu changes in the US, marking the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin. Starting in July, the chain will introduce a spicy version of the breakfast classic for the first time and reintroduce its long-discontinued Snack Wrap.

The updates reflect shifting customer preferences and come amid wider efforts to attract younger diners and boost footfall.

Spicy McMuffin: A New Take on a Classic

From 8 July, McDonald's will roll out three spicy Egg McMuffin options in the US. The new range will feature a Spicy Pepper Sauce developed to appeal to younger customers and fans of stronger flavours. Menu additions include the Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

According to a recent consumer trends report, 74 per cent of Americans regularly use hot sauce, and nearly four in five Gen Z diners prefer spicier food. The move to spice up one of McDonald's most iconic breakfast items signals a shift in how the company is responding to changing tastes and evolving expectations around fast food.

Snack Wrap Returns: A Cult Favourite Revived

​​On 10 July, McDonald's will also bring back its Snack Wrap, a customer favourite that was removed from the menu in 2016 due to equipment and preparation constraints. It will return in two flavours: Ranch and Spicy, both using McCrispy chicken strips, lettuce and shredded cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla. While McDonald's has not officially confirmed whether the grilled version will return, reports suggest that only the crispy chicken option will be available at launch.

The wrap's revival follows years of customer demand and persistent online campaigns. On platforms like TikTok and Reddit, users have frequently called for its return, with some even attempting to recreate the item at home. McDonald's has said the wrap will remain on the menu as long as customer interest remains strong. While this announcement applies only to the US, the company has suggested it may consider broader availability if the product performs well.

Strategic Context: Why Now, and Why It Matters

The Egg McMuffin, first introduced in 1972 by Californian franchisee Herb Peterson, became a national breakfast staple by 1975. Its enduring popularity has helped define McDonald's breakfast offering for half a century. By launching new versions during its anniversary year, the company is leveraging nostalgia while modernising its image.

The limited-time offerings are designed to encourage app downloads, reward programme enrolments and in-store traffic. The reintroduction of familiar items in new formats also plays into McDonald's wider digital strategy, which includes dynamic menu changes and user-customised ordering through mobile platforms.

For long-time customers, the spicy Egg McMuffin and returning Snack Wrap offer a mix of familiarity and novelty. These additions provide more variety during breakfast and lunch hours and are aimed at consumers seeking flavour-forward, convenient food options.

Although the company has not confirmed whether these items will be introduced in the UK or other markets, the announcement marks a broader shift in how McDonald's responds to consumer demand and market trends. The decision to refresh one of its most iconic products, while reviving a cult favourite, reflects a more adaptive and customer-led approach to menu development.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1730687/mcdonalds-logo.png,N,,2025-07-08 04:59:35.149506

""Value and essentials will outperform premium as shoppers focus on deals for everyday items, especially back-to-school and replenishment,"" Mike Feldman, senior vice president of commerce at Flywheel, told Axios.

State of play: Retailers have warned that some seasonal events could be affected by tariffs, with shortages and higher prices possible.

Jacob Bennett, CEO and co-founder of small business banking platform Crux Analytics, tells Axios that some Amazon sellers pulled out of Prime Day because of tariffs.

Trump hit Bangladesh with 37 percent tariffs in an April 2 announcement, but in a letter issued Tuesday, the US leader said it would now be 35 percent.
Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called it ""a big challenge for the garment sector"".
""We had expected the tariff imposed on us to be between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said, adding he expected Dhaka's interim leader Muhammad Yunus to ""raise the issue with the United States"".
""The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,"" he said.","Textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of exports in Bangladesh and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard in a student-led revolution that toppled the government last year.

""There is a hope for getting a reduced rate of tariffs as USTR (Office of the United States Trade Representative) sent another draft document for review,"" Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman told AFP.

Rahman said the South Asia nation's national security adviser and commerce adviser were ""working on the issue"" in the United States.

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the United States in 2024, while imports from there amounted to $2.21 billion, according to the Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.

US clothing companies that source products from Bangladesh range from Fruit of the Loom to Levi Strauss to VF Corp -- whose brands include Vans, Timberland and The North Face.

Trump hit Bangladesh with 37 percent tariffs in an April 2 announcement, but in a letter issued Tuesday, the US leader said it would now be 35 percent.

That is more than double the 16 percent already placed on cotton products.

Dhaka has proposed to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, which Trump has used as justification for imposing painful levies.

Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called it ""a big challenge for the garment sector"".

""We had expected the tariff imposed on us to be between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said, adding he expected Dhaka's interim leader Muhammad Yunus to ""raise the issue with the United States"".

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned the impact as tariffs stand would be dire.

""The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,"" he said.

""Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.""

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesman said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News.

The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse

a sales slump

, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers.

In June, Starbucks chief executive Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities.

Starbucks’ US menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks did not provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Mr Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu.

The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Mr Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for non-dairy milk, and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavour.

The chain’s latest US beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

In a sector ripe for consolidation, BNP Paribas is staking its claim as Europe's financial services champion.","BNP Paribas, Europe's second-largest bank by assets, has embarked on a sweeping reorganization that reshapes its corporate structure, leadership, and strategic priorities. The moves—consolidating Eurozone commercial and personal banking under Yannick Jung, overhauling governance at its Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) division, and leveraging the AXA IM acquisition to amplify its asset management footprint—signal an audacious bid to dominate the fragmented European financial landscape. For investors, the question is clear: Can these moves turn BNP Paribas into a growth-driven, tech-enabled titan, or will they expose vulnerabilities in a sector still grappling with low rates and regulatory headwinds?

The Eurozone Play: Yannick Jung's Unified Banking Ambition

At the heart of BNP Paribas' overhaul is the consolidation of its Eurozone commercial and personal banking operations under Yannick Jung, a veteran of its Corporate & Institutional Banking division. Jung's new role as Deputy Chief Operating Officer and head of the newly formed Commercial, Personal Banking & Services (CPBS) unit merges France, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg into a single entity. The goal? To unify technological investments, cross-sell products across divisions, and streamline operations for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs)—a segment that accounts for over 70% of European employment but remains underserved by digital tools.

The strategy hinges on a “shared technology backbone” to reduce costs and enhance customer experience. For instance, Jung's unit will collaborate with CIB to offer SMEs end-to-end solutions—from transaction banking to capital markets access—while leveraging the IPS division's wealth management and insurance products. This integration could be a game-changer in the Savings and Investment Union (SIU), the EU's plan to harmonize pensions and savings products across borders.

The CIB Governance Overhaul: A New Model for European Investment Banking

The CIB division, which generates nearly half of BNP Paribas' revenue, has undergone its own seismic shift. Yann Gérardin, the Group's Chief Operating Officer, now serves as Executive Chairman of CIB, while Olivier Osty—a former head of CIB's Global Markets—becomes its CEO. This dual-leadership structure aims to balance strategic vision with operational execution.

The reorganization splits CIB into two coverage arms (Institutional and Corporate), five business lines (Transaction Banking, Capital Markets, Equities, FICC, and Securities Services), and three geographic regions. The move is a clear nod to CIB's “Originate & Distribute” strategy, which has doubled its revenue over the past decade. But the stakes are high: CIB must now compete with rivals like JPMorgan Chase's European arm while navigating regulatory scrutiny and the shift to digital-first client engagement.

The AXA IM Acquisition: Building an Asset Management Goliath

Perhaps the most transformative move is the €5.4 billion acquisition of AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM), finalized in July 2025. This deal, which boosts BNP Paribas' assets under management (AUM) to over €1.5 trillion, positions the bank as Europe's leader in long-term savings and private asset management. The integration of AXA IM's expertise into BNP's existing asset management divisions—BNP Paribas Asset Management and BNP Paribas REIM—creates a platform with global scale and a focus on ESG-driven investing.

The financial upside is compelling: BNP projects a compound annual revenue growth rate of over 5% through 2026, with returns on invested capital (ROIC) exceeding 14% by 2028 and 20% by 2029. Yet risks loom. The transaction temporarily reduces BNP's CET1 capital ratio—a key prudential metric—by 35 basis points, and employee consultations over merging legal entities remain unresolved.

Why Investors Should Take Note

BNP Paribas' reorganization is a bet on three interconnected trends:

1. Synergies in Digital Banking: Unifying Eurozone operations could cut costs by 10-15% and fuel cross-selling opportunities.

2. SME Financing Growth: With the SIU's push to standardize savings products, BNP's integrated model could capture a disproportionate share of SME lending and advisory fees.

3. Asset Management Dominance: The AXA IM acquisition positions BNP to capitalize on Europe's aging population and demand for long-term savings products.

The bank's stock, trading at a 15% discount to its pre-pandemic peak, offers a potential entry point if execution delivers on its ROIC targets. Competitors like Société Générale and UniCredit face similar challenges in cost-cutting and digital transformation, but BNP's scale and geographic focus give it an edge.

Risks to the Play

Regulatory Pushback: The European Central Bank's scrutiny of bank capital adequacy and cross-border operations could delay synergies.

Integration Hurdles: Merging AXA IM's culture and systems with BNP's divisions is no small task.

Economic Downturn: A recession could pressure SME loan portfolios and asset management AUM.

Investment Takeaway

BNP Paribas' reorganization is a high-stakes gamble—but one with a clear path to success. For investors seeking exposure to European financials, the bank's focus on synergies, tech-driven integration, and long-term asset management growth makes it a compelling pick, provided execution stays on track. Monitor ROIC improvements and CET1 recovery closely; patience could be rewarded.

In a sector ripe for consolidation, BNP Paribas is staking its claim as Europe's financial services champion. The question now is whether its strategic overhaul can deliver the returns its shareholders—and the continent's economy—desperately need.",,N,,2025-07-08 02:58:54.543026

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI.
Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations.
Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.","Capgemini, a global business and technology transformation partner, and WNS, a leading digital-led business transformation and services company, announced that they have entered into a definitive transaction agreement pursuant to which Capgemini will acquire WNS.

WNS is a leading and trusted business transformation and services partner that uniquely blends deep industry knowledge with business process management, technology, analytics and AI expertise to create market differentiation for clients. With digital-led transformation solutions deployed to clients across 8 industries where it deploys its highly automated platforms to deliver stronger business outcomes, WNS is a leader in Digital Business Process Services (BPS).

This operating model enables strategic engagements that are critical to clients’ daily operations materialized in long-term contracts with recurring revenues streams. Through an expanded ecosystem of partners and network of delivery centers, WNS serves a large portfolio of blue-chip clients, such as United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods.

The high-quality business model of WNS, supported by non-linear pricing models and superior profitability has driven a c.+9% constant currency revenue growth on average over the last 3 fiscal years, to reach $1,266 million of revenue in fiscal year 2025 with an 18.7% operating margin.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of +7% to +11% for FY2026.

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labor-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

The contemplated transaction will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under the laws of Jersey. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Capgemini’s and WNS’ Boards of Directors.

The transaction is subject to approval by the Royal Court of Jersey and WNS’ shareholders, as well as to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and other conditions. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by the end of the year.

Capgemini has secured a bridge financing of €4.0 billion, covering the purchase of securities ($3.3 billion), as well as the gross debt and similar obligations of around $0.4 billion and the €0.8 billion Capgemini bond redeemed in June 2025.

The Group plans to refinance the bridge with available cash for around €1.0 billion and the balance by debt issuance.

The Group expects Q2 2025 year-on-year growth at constant currency to be slightly better than the -0.4% reported in Q1 2025. The Group also expects for H1 2025 the operating margin to be stable year-on-year at 12.4%.

Due to the nature and timing of this announcement, the actual Q2 and H1 2025 performance may slightly differ from the above-mentioned expectations. H1 2025 publication will take place as planned on July 30, 2025.

Capgemini’s financial targets for 2025 do not take into account this transaction and are therefore unchanged:

To accelerate progress, Nike is implementing a new strategy called “Sport Offense,” which aims to align its teams more closely around sport.
The Sport Offense initiative will refine Nike’s brand positioning in core categories, simplify its product offerings, strengthen its storytelling, and reshape its market approach to drive growth.
In China, Nike supported local basketball culture through the Chinese High School Basketball League and grassroots platform “Next Stop Dongdan.” It also introduced the Nike ST Flare “Blaze,” a basketball shoe tailored for outdoor play.
This year, Nike’s women’s basketball business grew by more than 50%.","Nike has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025, which ended on May 31. The company reported USD 46.3 billion in annual revenue, with USD 11.1 billion generated in the final quarter. Greater China contributed USD 6.585 billion for the year and USD 1.476 billion in the fourth quarter, exceeding market expectations in both cases. On the day the report was published, Nike’s stock rose 15.25%, marking its largest single-day gain in nearly four years and pushing its market capitalization to USD 106.4 billion.

This was the first full-year report since Heidi O’Neill became CEO. While transformation takes time, Nike’s “Win Now” strategy is beginning to yield results. As O’Neill acknowledged, the company’s financial performance met expectations, but not the internal benchmarks it had set. To accelerate progress, Nike is implementing a new strategy called “Sport Offense,” which aims to align its teams more closely around sport.

The Sport Offense initiative will refine Nike’s brand positioning in core categories, simplify its product offerings, strengthen its storytelling, and reshape its market approach to drive growth.

Meanwhile, the numbers suggest that Nike, still one of the most storied names in global sportswear, is leaning into a period of change. Even in a challenging market, it is building momentum for long-term gains.

A difficult challenge, and a meaningful outcome

Just two hours before Nike’s earnings report went live, Faith Kipyegon crossed the finish line at Stade Charlety in Paris. The Kenyan middle distance runner clocked a personal best of 4:06.42, beating her previous record by more than a second. It was her first attempt at the “Breaking4,” a joint initiative with Nike to break the four-minute mile barrier—a feat no woman has ever achieved.

Back in April, Kipyegon and Nike jointly announced an ambitious goal: to break the four-minute mile barrier, a feat no woman has ever accomplished.

Although she did not reach the target, the attempt marked a significant moment. Kipyegon emphasized that no woman had tried before, and she believes it is only a matter of time until the barrier is broken. Her aim is to encourage more women to pursue bold goals without self-imposed limits.

This is not Nike’s first time supporting efforts to test the boundaries of human performance. At the 1984 Summer Olympics, Joan Benoit won the first women’s marathon gold medal. In 2019, Eliud Kipchoge, with Nike’s backing, became the first person to complete a marathon in under two hours. These events reflect Nike’s brand ethos and are backed by dedicated R&D and product design.

Turning the corner

Breaking4 also connects directly to Nike’s broader Win Now strategy. According to O’Neill, the plan emphasizes quick execution to enhance competitiveness by focusing on core categories, simplifying operations, and reigniting growth amid intense competition and changing consumer behavior.

In this fiscal year, Nike has ramped up its focus on running, combining product innovation with storytelling. It revamped its road running shoe lineup to emphasize cushioning, releasing models like the ultra-cushioned Vomero, the support-oriented Structure, and the responsive Pegasus. The Vomero 18 alone generated over USD 100 million in sales within 90 days, suggesting consumers are responding well to the simplified lineup.

On the athlete engagement front, Nike brought Kipchoge to Beijing and Guangzhou as part of a China tour aimed at boosting local marathon participation. At the Tokyo Marathon in March, Chinese runner Zhang Deshun, wearing Nike’s Alphafly 3, recorded a time of 2:20:53, marking the best performance by a Chinese female marathoner since 2007. The result reinforced Nike’s presence in elite running.

Nike’s emphasis on sport isn’t limited to running. It also maintained leadership in basketball. The company launched new signature shoes including Kevin Durant’s KD18 and Ja Morant’s Nike JA3. In China, Nike supported local basketball culture through the Chinese High School Basketball League and grassroots platform “Next Stop Dongdan.” It also introduced the Nike ST Flare “Blaze,” a basketball shoe tailored for outdoor play.

These product and athlete-focused efforts have been matched by backend improvements. Amid a market where brand fatigue is setting in, Nike is leaning on its foundational strengths: innovation and cultural engagement. It also made progress in managing inventory and strengthening retail partnerships.

O’Neill credited these partnerships as essential to Nike’s progress. Retailers reported stronger holiday season orders in North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APLA (Asia Pacific and Latin America). Inventory levels showed improvement as well, with Nike reducing its lineup of legacy footwear by over 20% for the year and more than 30% in Q4. In Greater China, inventory dropped 11% compared to the previous year.

Nike aims to clear remaining excess inventory through select channels over the next two quarters, with a goal of restoring full channel health by the first half of fiscal 2026.

Targeting new segments and emotional engagement

Nike is investing in emerging growth areas too. Industry observers widely agree that women, children, and outdoor activities remain rare pockets of untapped potential for sportswear brands. The Breaking4 represents Nike’s latest bid to claim leadership in the women’s category.

Historically, women’s distance running has lagged in commercial interest and investment. With this initiative, Nike has placed a world-class female athlete at the center of both its brand storytelling and product innovation, unlocking momentum in a category with vast potential.

In April, Nike also launched the global women’s night run series, the “After Dark Tour,” in Shanghai. Over 3,500 women took part, turning the night into a celebration of performance and empowerment.

Nike continued to build a female-focused narrative during Shanghai Fashion Week in April with the “Victory Lap,” a runway event where athletes, designers, and emerging idols reinterpreted sport through a female lens, fusing function with fashion.

The brand also brought Sabrina Ionescu to China for the first time, where her personal story reportedly resonated with younger female fans. This year, Nike’s women’s basketball business grew by more than 50%.

At the same time, Nike is also tapping into youth culture in China, where emotional resonance often guides purchasing decisions. This quarter, a collaboration with Lego introduced a co-branded collection and interactive retail elements. During the 618 shopping festival, Nike Kids led Tmall’s children’s sneaker and sports categories.

Even before the earnings release, analysts had highlighted Nike’s strong appeal among younger consumers as a potential sign of recovery.

In addition to its focus on women and children, Nike is capitalizing on the growing interest in outdoor apparel. The company recently became the title sponsor of the Chongli 168 Ultra Trail and launched a Nike ACG (All Conditions Gear) training camp to offer runners technical guidance and immersive experiences. The ACG line is gaining traction both globally and in China.

As Nike expands beyond its traditional core, its long-term approach—grounded in innovation, storytelling, and local investment—is paving new paths for growth.

And if the current trajectory holds, Nike may once again defy its doubters. Its legacy, and its spirit of pushing limits, remains central to its strategy. Just as Breaking4 reminds us: dare to dream, no matter how distant the goal.",https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nike-Run.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 05:58:34.219632

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS A LinkedIn post about the coffee giant's new 3% Employee Benefits & Retention fee sparked a debate among Starbucks customers, many of which were disapproving of the charge.
They ""are allowed to set their own prices, establish their own pay and benefits, and are completely separate from Starbucks,"" according to a former Starbucks employee of eight years.","STARBUCKS fans have begun noticing that the coffee giant is tacking on an extra charge to receipts, labeling it an ""Employee Benefits & Retention"" fee.

The 3% fee, bumping up customers' bill totals, has many fans up in arms and complaining about the coffee giant's operations.

High inflation, interest rates, and cost-of-living have all placed pressure on businesses, many of which have raised their prices to increase their profit margin.

Consumers have been forced to shell out more cash over the years for the same goods and services, and many establishments have begun rolling out additional fees to help make ends meet.

Starbucks, for example, has started implementing a ""Employee Benefits & Retention"" fee at select locations.

Customers at the location in the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, for example, are subject to the 3% fee.

The fee is not a corporate-wide charge but rather a localized surcharge implemented by businesses at certain airports.

The extra charge stems from a policy approved by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, permitting airport vendors to add a surcharge of up to 3% on pre-tax sales.

Following the expansion of a minimum wage policy to include automatic annual pay increases, the new Starbucks fee was rolled out to help offset the costs of increased minimum wages and benefits for airport workers.

The new regulations also permit businesses at the airport to hike their prices up to 15% more than at traditional locations, up from the previous 10% cap.

The U.S. Sun reached out to Starbucks for comment on the Employee Benefits & Retention fee.

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS

A LinkedIn post about the coffee giant's new 3% Employee Benefits & Retention fee sparked a debate among Starbucks customers, many of which were disapproving of the charge.

""This is so dumb. Just list your price. I'll pay it if I want to. Stop being dumb, Starbucks,"" cried one user.

Another Starbucks customer called the 3% charge a ""forced tip,"" complaining that they ""can live without the coffee"" and would rather spend their money elsewhere in the terminal for water or at McDonald's for a cheap coffee.

""I yearn for the European non-tipping and non-customer responsibility for paying the wages of their employees,"" they wrote.

""Oh, hell no!!! This just shows that Starbucks is focused strictly on their profit margin,"" fumed a third shopper.

""Constant turnover already speaks to an employer's priorities, but expecting customers to pay for Starbucks' failure to invest in and retain employees is beyond ridiculous.""

Other fans defended Starbucks itself, arguing that franchised locations such as the one at the airport are not technically owned by the company.

They ""are allowed to set their own prices, establish their own pay and benefits, and are completely separate from Starbucks,"" according to a former Starbucks employee of eight years.

Another LinkedIn user and HR expert delved into the financial implications of the 3% charge, revealing that it would generate a significant profit to be used on worker benefits.

Based on the John F. Kennedy Terminal 5 traffic and industry estimates, they calculated that the 3% fee could bring in approximately $334,880 per year for Starbucks to spend on employee benefits and retention.

""To put that in context: it’s enough to FULLY fund industry-average benefits for 30+ baristas,"" they wrote.

Other establishments have similarly begun tacking on extra fees in an effort to generate a customer-funded pot that can go towards employees.

For example, diners vowed to never eat at a restaurant again after a man checked his receipt to find he was charged an extra ""living wage fee.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/SC-Sbux-Charge-Off-Plat-copy.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 03:58:35.590334

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is approved in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Taiwan and Korea.

IRVINE, Calif., July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, today announced the launch of the VARIPULSE™ Platform in Asia-Pacific. The platform is used to perform catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by extra, uncoordinated electrical signals in the atria.x AFib is associated with structural changes in the heart due to underlying conditions and lifestyle factors.x,xi It significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first PFA technology designed to streamline ablation and mapping through a single integrated workflow with the CARTO™ 3 System. This 3D electroanatomical cardiac mapping technology enables real-time visualization and supports precision, efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy for physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib)xii. It enables safe and efficienti,ii,iii,iv,v,vi,vii, patient-centric therapy with minimal to no fluoroscopy exposurexiii,xiv,xv and is compatible with deep and/or conscious sedation.2,xvi,xvii

This innovation is backed by compelling clinical evidence. Both the inspIRE and admIRE clinical trials demonstrated strong safety and effectiveness of the VARIPULSE™ Platform:

In inspIRE, 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence with zero primary adverse events.xviii

In admIRE, results showed a 75% overall primary effectiveness success rate3, a 2.9% primary adverse event rate4,xix, 100% of patients achieved acute procedural success5, 43% had same-day discharge, and 25% of procedures were performed without fluoroscopy6.

In the ongoing VARIPURE registry, which included first-time users, there were no serious adverse events and no complications linked to the platform, including zero neurovascular events or coronary spasmsxx.

""The introduction of the VARIPULSE™ Platform in the Asia-Pacific region marks a significant advancement towards our goal of transforming atrial fibrillation care,"" stated Jing Li, Vice President, Electrophysiology & Neurovascular, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Asia Pacific. ""The adoption of the VARIPULSE™ Platform could demonstrate the unique value of integration with CARTO™ 3D to enhance efficiencies in the workflow of AFib treatment and improve patient outcomes.""

Atrial Fibrillation affects over 16 million people in Asia-Pacificxxi. Symptoms and clinical consequences of AFib disrupt patient's quality of life. The most common symptoms are heart palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizzinessxxii. As a progressive condition, early intervention is critical to reducing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortalityxxiii.

Unlike traditional ablation methods that use heat or cold, PFA uses short bursts of energy to affect heart tissue, potentially reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue such as the esophagus, pulmonary veins, and phrenic nerve.

""PFA, as a new type of energy, has the potential to further enhance the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation treatment, which is desirable for patients"" said Dr. Yasuo Okumura7, Professor and Department Head, Vice Hospital Director, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. ""PFA is a relatively new medical technology, and therefore it is important to continue to assess its effectiveness and efficacy in Asia while ensuring proper use. But so far, we know that the integration of PFA technology with 3D mapping enables physicians to review their procedure in detail, and this contributes to quality of healthcare for patients.""

Until last year, sandwich chain Jimmy John’s franchises were found solely in the United States. It’s since been expanding within Canada — and at least two locations could open in Winnipeg this fall.

Posters displaying sandwiches — perhaps not the Turkey Tom, but meaty options — plaster 1740 Pembina Hwy. and 1430 Ellice Ave. Both sites were construction zones Monday.

Jimmy John’s stayed mum on details but confirmed “several” eateries are planned. Autumn could bring opening dates, the company shared. It will release more information nationally in upcoming weeks.

Last year, the chain’s parent company, Inspire Brands LLC, announced it would use a franchise model for a Canadian expansion. Just one Canadian location has launched thus far, in Toronto.

“I think this is a good fit for our local community looking for more restaurants,” said Sijie Sun, a University of Manitoba marketing professor.

He asks his students to choose brands they’d like to bring to Winnipeg for a class project; Jimmy John’s is often mentioned, Sun said.

The Illinois-based company started in 1983 with four sandwich types. It now counts more than 2,000 stores and a slate of choices, including “unwiches,” where buns are swapped for lettuce exteriors.

The Winnipeg market will be competitive, Sun noted: Subway, Firehouse Subs and Tim Hortons are among the big sandwich-selling chains already in town.

“If there’s more options, definitely people try the new one,” Sun said, adding brands create loyal customers.

He’s noticed American-born chains advertising local leadership at their Winnipeg hubs as a U.S.-Canada trade war persists. Grocery stores are labelling Canadian products as shoppers turn from U.S. imports.

Jimmy John’s will likely highlight its own connection with Canada, Sun said.

“I think this is a good fit for our local community looking for more restaurants.”–Sijie Sun

“You almost wonder, is this a good time (to come)?” added Wenlong Yuan, the Stu Clark chair in entrepreneurship and innovation at the U of M. “Are they going to be damaged because of this political issue?”

Arby’s and Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers locations opened within the past four months, amid a ‘Buy Canadian’ push. Arby’s ran out of meat on its first day due to demand; Freddy’s was met with great anticipation.

It’s “really hard to tell” whether companies are being stunted by a Canada-first sentiment, Yuan stated.

U.S. chains including Krispy Kreme and Firehouse Subs have arrived in Winnipeg over the past 1.5 years. Winnipeg’s size and diverse population can be a draw for businesses wanting to try operating in Canada, Yuan said.

Franchisees may be locals wanting to bring the brand home or they may have experienced Winnipeg via family and friends.

Inspire Brands tapped Foodtastic Inc., a Canadian franchisor, to expand Jimmy John’s across Canada. Inspire Brands houses labels like Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings and Dunkin’.

Foodtastic counted more than 1,100 restaurants in January 2024 — the month of the deal’s announcement — and $1.1 billion in sales. The Montreal-based company umbrellas Freshii, Second Cup Café and Pita Pit, among others.

Jimmy John’s Toronto location opened in November 2024. In September and October, the chain unrolled in El Salvador and South Korea.

In Winnipeg, it’s taking a former Urban Barn space off Ellice Avenue.

“I think another restaurant always brings in more people to the area,” said Desiree Rafael, an employee at neighbouring Acuity Vision Care. “If they see that there is an optometry practice by where they’re eating, then maybe they’ll be inclined to come get their eyes checked.”

The Jimmy John’s off Pembina Highway replaces a Macao Imperial Tea.

Jimmy John’s wouldn’t comment on whether more Manitoba shops are coming.

Redberry Restaurants, parent company of sandwich brand Jersey Mike’s Subs, said in January 2024 it aimed to open 300 Canadian locations by 2034. Redberry Restaurants didn’t respond to questions about Winnipeg plans by print deadline.

About The New Terminal One

The New Terminal One at John F. Kennedy International Airport is a bold and exciting project to develop a best-in-class international terminal that will serve as an anchor terminal in the Port Authority's $19 billion transformation of JFK into a global gateway to the New York metropolitan area and the United States. The New Terminal One will set a new standard for design and service, aspiring to obtain a Top 5 Skytrax ranking.

The New Terminal One is being built on sites now occupied by Terminal 1 and the former Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, where it will anchor JFK's south side. Construction is taking place in phases with full completion in 2030. The first phase, including the new arrivals and departures halls and first set of 14 new gates, is expected to open in 2026. At completion in 2030, the New Terminal One, with a total of 23 gates, will be 2.6 million square feet, making it the largest terminal at JFK and nearly the same size as LaGuardia Airport's two new terminals combined.

The New Terminal One consortium of labor, operating, and financial partners is led by Ferrovial, JLC Infrastructure, Ullico, and Carlyle. The New Terminal One is being built by union labor and is committed to local inclusion and labor participation, focusing on diversity and capacity-building opportunities, including a commitment to target participation goals of 20% for minority-owned business enterprises, 10% for women-owned business enterprises, 10% for local business enterprises and 3% for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end.

The purchase price of USD $76.50 per share represents a premium of 28% over the average share price in the last 90 days and 17% over the closing price on 3 July 2025. Both firms' boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction, with closing anticipated by year-end, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Strategic rationale

According to Capgemini, the acquisition aligns with a growing trend among enterprises looking to transform end-to-end operations using Generative and Agentic AI, especially within business process services (BPS). The combined entity aims to capitalise on what both businesses describe as a paradigm shift from traditional BPS to intelligent, AI-driven operations.

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI. Capgemini's acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,"" comments Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini. ""Together we will create a leader in Intelligent Operations, uniquely positioned to support organizations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the critical capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms to deep process and industry expertise. This will address the client needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation while achieving superior business outcomes. WNS brings to the Group its high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services, which is the springboard to Intelligent Operations, while further increasing our exposure to the US market. Immediate cross-selling opportunities will be unlocked through the integration of our complementary offerings and clients. I am looking forward to welcoming the WNS global team to Capgemini.""

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, also highlighted the significance of integrating AI deeper into operational frameworks:

""As a recognized leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients. Organizations that have already digitized are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy,"" said Murugesh. ""By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini's global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem, and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention. WNS' complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini's rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors. Just as importantly, our shared values, cultural alignment, and complementary client relationships ensure a seamless integration—unlocking exciting opportunities for innovation, co-creation, and growth across all stakeholder groups.""

Timothy L. Main, Chairman of the WNS Board of Directors, underscored the transaction as a milestone for WNS and cited the opportunities for both clients and employees.

""WNS and Capgemini share a bold, future-focused vision for Intelligent Operations. I'm confident that Capgemini is the ideal partner at the right time in WNS' journey to extend our capabilities, accelerate innovation, and establish a leadership position in this rapidly evolving market,"" said Main. ""This marks a pivotal chapter in WNS' growth—enhancing the resilience and agility of our clients through advanced AI-driven solutions, creating sustained value for our investors, and opening up new avenues for our employees to thrive within a global technology powerhouse.""

Financial impact and integration

On a financial basis, Capgemini has secured bridge financing totalling EUR €4.0 billion, with plans to refinance through available cash and new debt issuance. The deal is projected to be accretive to Capgemini's normalised earnings per share by 4% prior to synergies in 2026, rising to 7% with synergies by 2027. Revenue synergies are estimated between EUR €100 million and €140 million annually by the end of 2027, while cost and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach EUR €50 million to €70 million per year within the same timeframe.

Combined, the two organisations would have generated EUR €23.3 billion in revenue at a 13.6% operating margin in 2024, based on published information.

Capgemini expects the integration to be smooth, citing both companies' shared values and cultural alignment, as well as Capgemini's record of successful past integrations. The merger will further strengthen Capgemini's global business services, especially in the US market where WNS has a strong presence.

Market context and future outlook

WNS, which reported revenues of USD $1,266 million and an 18.7% operating margin in fiscal year 2025, has focused on providing digital-led BPS solutions to clients in eight industries. The company has achieved approximately 9% constant currency revenue growth on average over the last three fiscal years. Capgemini believes that combining WNS's industry-specific expertise with its own consulting and AI capabilities will allow the enlarged group to support organisations seeking end-to-end transformation through advanced technologies and platforms.

Both companies say the acquisition will enable them to address rapidly-growing demand for AI-driven business process redesign, which is increasingly prioritised by enterprises aiming to improve efficiency, agility and business outcomes. With market analysts and Capgemini's clients reportedly recognising the group's leadership in AI and business transformation, the acquisition of WNS is expected to reinforce Capgemini's role as a partner to organisations on similar transformation journeys.",https://channellife.com.au/uploads/story/2025/07/08/compatible_business-professionals-shaking-hands-ai-integration-corporate-acquisition-illustration.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:20.083774

""You created a movement,"" the post said. ""A movement so powerful that you finally won.""

According to McDonald's, the revamped Snack Wrap includes one of the chain's new McCrispy Strips, which hit menus in May. In the wrap, the strip is topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, and wrapped in a flour tortilla.

According to the Affluent Consumer Research Company’s May luxury tracking survey, luxury consumer fatigue is measurable.
Yet, there remains a lack of enthusiasm and emotional draw for affluent consumers.” Note: I am professionally affiliated with ACRC.
These insights require luxury goods brands to reframe their value proposition above the price-value relationship toward a return on worth.
Pamela N. Danziger is an internationally recognized expert specializing in consumer insights for marketers targeting the affluent consumer segment.","The personal luxury goods market faces a decline of up to 5% this year as consumer enthusiasm wanes, according to the latest projections from Bain and Company in association with Altagamma.

Not since the 2008-2009 financial crisis has the luxury market experienced such a significant contraction, except for the 2020 Covid pandemic.

Besides the obvious flashpoints creating uncertainty in the market, including rising geopolitical tensions, currency fluctuations and volatile economic pressures, luxury consumers are disillusioned by the industry’s offerings, particularly after post-pandemic price increases threw a monkey wrench into brands’ traditional price-value relationship.

“There’s a sense of emotional detachment, even among the wealthy, who can’t explain why the same bag that cost $1,200 before now costs $2,000 – prices are too high for such a low level of creativity,” Bain’s senior partner Federica Levato shared with me. “The disillusionment and detachment we talk about is particularly noted among younger consumers.”

Bain’s Macro Overview

Rising luxury consumer detachment was reflected last year, as the luxury market declined 1% at current exchange rates to $418 billion (€364 billion) – or remained flat at constant rates. Yet, most telling was that the luxury market lost some 50 million customers over the last two years. Today, the estimated number of luxury consumers worldwide is approximately 353 million, down from 400 million in 2022.

“This is true alienation, meaning many people are just not buying anymore,” she observed, adding that engagement with luxury brands across all demographics, not just the younger aspirational cohort, has declined since 2022.

Brand-related searches and engagement rates are down more than 40% and social media follower growth has plummeted by 90% – “largely due to price fatigue and stagnant creativity.”

Creative Churn

For an industry that thrives on artistic creativity, the growing churn in luxury brand senior executives and creative directors is taking its toll. Consumers may not be aware of what’s going on behind the curtain, but they see it in the stores and the brands ultimately feel it on their top and bottom line.

“While companies are waiting for a new creative director to introduce a new collection, it can take nine months to a year for the transition – like giving birth to a baby,” Levato explained. “Consumers may not know about the shifts, but they see it when no new products arrive and the brands are totally silent during the transition.”

And she added, “Then there’s also a 50% probability that the new collection doesn’t work, as has been the case for some brands in the recent past.”

Profit Pressure

All this is sinking to luxury brands’ bottom line. Bain notes that since 2021, margins (defined by earnings before interest and taxes) have either stagnated or declined, even among top industry performers, and margins are expected to erode further in 2025.

“All the macroeconomic uncertainties, tariffs, lower traffic, fewer new products – over 70% of luxury brands are pulling back volume from multi-brand retail platforms – have an impact on the topline, but have a more than proportional impact on the bottom line and on the EBIT,” Levato said.

“The message is to some extent is positive because brands are not hitting the brakes on investments in technology, marketing, clienteling and stores, but they still must absorb the costs,” she continued, adding further price increases are probably off the table in the current environment.

Global Luxury Reset

Saying the luxury market faces “far-reaching disruptions,” the Bain report also stresses the industry’s proven resiliency, yet Levato stresses industry players can’t rest on their laurels.

“As the industry faces an increasingly complex global landscape, luxury brands are entering a pivotal new chapter – one that demands sharper focus, greater cultural relevance, and growth rooted in purpose.

“At the heart of this transformation is a redefinition of value and meaning that resonates across all generations – with those shaping luxury today, and those who will define it tomorrow,” she observed.

U.S. Luxury Consumers On Hold

Because the U.S. is the world’s richest market – last year 1,000 new millionaires were minted here each day, totaling nearly 400,000, and more than half of all new millionaires globally – and the largest personal luxury market by far – the Americas totaled about $115 billion last year with the lion’s share in the U.S., compared to $51 billion in Mainland China – what happens here will have a profound impact on the global personal luxury market overall.

According to the Affluent Consumer Research Company’s May luxury tracking survey, luxury consumer fatigue is measurable. Specifically, 52% of the roughly 200 affluent Americans with incomes of $250,000 and above reported being disappointed with luxury options, and 46% were unable to justify new purchases.

But most telling is that among those affluents who tend to opt for the luxury option most often, 55% said they’re bidding their time, and the same 55% share signaled that the available options simply do not move them.

“Purchase hesitation isn’t one-size-fits-all,” observed ACRC’s founder and CEO Chandler Mount. “At the top of the market, it’s not about affordability – it’s about emotional resonance. They’re bidding their time, a signal of flexibility, not resistance. Yet, there remains a lack of enthusiasm and emotional draw for affluent consumers.” Note: I am professionally affiliated with ACRC.

While Americans wait for luxury goods brands to present more compelling options, Bain reports that the luxury experiences market, including hospitality, fine dining, cruising and private jets, is “flourishing,” as consumers prioritize meaningful experiences over goods, particularly among older consumers, where wealth tends to accumulate.

Personal Transformation Is The Goal, Not More Stuff

At its core, luxury is a cultural construct rooted in personal meaning, social status, and an expression of self-worth. While owning an abundance of luxury goods can confer some of those advantages, increasingly affluent and high-net-worth individuals are turning luxury expression inward toward personal growth and well-being.

This cultural shift in consumer consciousness has profound implications for the goods side of the luxury market. “This isn’t a trend – it’s a complete reconstruction of how success is defined by the world’s most affluent and influential consumers,” said Mark Miller, chief strategy officer at Publicis Groupe’s Team One agency. “It’s a shift from building high-net-worth to pursuing high-life-worth.”

He was speaking about Team One’s latest study entitled “Worth Beyond Wealth,” based upon research among its exclusive Global Affluent Collective. The collective represents the top 10% of global earnings across 22 countries and totals some 4,200 consumers aged 25 and above.

“The most provocative finding is how they’ve moved beyond asking ‘What do I own?’ to ‘Who am I becoming?’ This transformation demands an entirely new approach from premium brands,” he continued.

Emerging Values

Findings that popped in the study, which combined both qualitative and quantitative research, include:

Prioritizing emotional fulfillment and human connection through key life moments defined by meaningful connections (89%) and relationships that elevate their lives (90%).

Pursuit of growth and discovery with continuous learning their ultimate luxury (95%) and 75% defining personal growth as life’s most significant moments.

Belief that status is earned through being knowledgeable and respected rather than through possessions (88%).

This shift toward pursuit of high-life-worth through meaningful experiences requires luxury goods brands adapt to a new “return on worth” price-value framework. Miller described this as a selective abundance approach, where people with means will spend abundantly on things that have special worth and save abundantly, i.e. trade down, in purchases that are substitutable or replaceable.

“There’s a strong need in this world of selective abundance for luxury goods brands to not just make things that are functionally excellent – consumers will know the difference – but to offer a value proposition that goes above and beyond the functional things they make,” he explained, stressing the need for greater high-life-worth storytelling, rather than relying on product features, benefits, brand heritage, design and quality.

“Luxury is no longer only about having exceptional things – it’s about integrating excellence with impact. The best premium brands won’t just sell luxury – they’ll help architect high-worth lives,” shared Tahni Candelaria, Team One’s director of cultural anthropology.

Miller added, “Luxury isn’t just about possessions anymore. It’s about acquiring the learning and relationships to become a more evolved version of who I aspire to be over time.”

Value Beyond Money

While the Bain study acknowledges some of this – “Across generations, drivers linked with self-reward, status, personal identity and the celebration of achievements will continue to drive engagement, reinforcing and building the lasting relevance of luxury with the consumers’ lives,” Claudia D’Arpizio said in a statement – Team One’s perspective pushes the concepts of luxury as self-reward, status, personal identity and celebrating achievements further toward value beyond what money can buy.

These insights require luxury goods brands to reframe their value proposition above the price-value relationship toward a return on worth. “The notion of worth is becoming far more dominant in how affluent consumers express themselves. Luxury consumption is becoming more conscious, purposeful, meaningful and impactful with a long-tail orientation that looks to the future, not to the past,” Miller concluded.

Less than two years ago, BermudAir launched service between Bermuda and Boston, with a fleet of two ex-Flybe Embraer E175 jets. The carrier now serves 10 destinations across the U.S. east coast, operating two E175s and two E190s.

The Bermudan carrier has since announced the launch of its subsidiary carrier, AnguillAir, which will operate seasonal flights from Anguilla (AXA) to both Baltimore (BWI) and Boston (BOS). Flights will operate twice weekly, starting on December 19 and 20, 2025, respectively. The winter service is expected to wrap up in early April 2026.

AnguillAir will have their own branded aircraft and respective marketing identity, but will still be part of BermudAir’s operations, rather than operating entirely as a separate airline. I’m no expert at aviation law, but I suspect it might be easier for them to keep operations streamlined, and maybe the fact that both Anguilla and Bermuda being U.K. overseas territories might make it easier for them to climb any regulatory hurdles.

“This is more than a new route – it’s a reflection of what BermudAir was built to do: strengthen island connections, deliver extraordinary service, and create lasting economic value for Bermuda and beyond,” said Adam Scott, Founder and CEO of BermudAir. “We’re proud that, because of the support of Bermudians and the growth in tourism demand, we are now able to extend our reach and share our island hospitality with Anguilla.”

On the flip side, BermudAir also announced that its Providence (PVD) and Ft. Lauderdale (FLL) flights will be suspended. It’s unclear if they will return to PVD, but plan to resume Ft. Lauderdale service only in the winter periods.

While Anguilla currently has some connectivity throughout the Caribbean, they only have two daily flights between the island and Miami (MIA), Florida. This will be a great boost for Anguilla’s travel market, but could also open the possibility of offering more non-U.S. connectivity to Anguilla in the long run.

It’s not clear either if they plan to acquire more aircraft, or if they will rebrand one of their current BermudAir jets for the period.",https://www.gatechecked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bermudair-embraer-e175.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 21:01:12.338731

Capgemini and WNS already dabble in intelligent operations.
Capgemini offers consulting-led transformation of business processes, advanced AI tools and BPS platforms, while WNS has built a number of industry-specific BPS offerings.
“The key driver is less to do with the tools and software, but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table,” Ranjan told Computerworld.","French technology consulting services giant Capgemini SE said today it has agreed to buy the Indian business process automation firm WNS Holdings Ltd. in a $3.3 billion cash deal, as part of an effort to expand the range of artificial intelligence tools it can offer to customers.

The acquisition will enable Capgemini to create a consulting service that’s focused on helping companies boost business process and cost efficiency through the use of generative AI and agentic AI technology.

Capgemini said it’s buying WNS for $76.50 per share, which represents a 17% premium over its last closing price on July 3. The deal does not include WNS’ financial debt.

WNS, which is based in India and specializes in business process outsourcing and data analytics, will bring its “high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services while further increasing our exposure to the U.S. market,” said Capgemini Chief Executive Aiman Ezzat.

WNS counts major customers including Coca-Cola Co., T-Mobile USA Inc. and United Airlines Inc. When the acquisition closes, it’s expected to position Capgemini as a leader in digital business process services, blending WNS’ horizontal and vertical expertise with a global footprint. The two companies generated combined revenues in digital BPS of more than $1.9 billion.

One of the largest opportunities for companies to create value with generative AI and AI agents is said to be in the redesign of business processes and operations. This is likely to attract a significant amount of AI investment budgets, as the technology promises to transform organizations into AI-powered companies with dramatically increased productivity through a new type of service known as intelligent operations.

Intelligent operations is a consulting-led approach that aims to transform horizontal and vertical business processes with AI agents and generative AI, seeking to improve companies’ efficiency, speed and agility and improve business outcomes through process automation.

Capgemini and WNS already dabble in intelligent operations. Capgemini offers consulting-led transformation of business processes, advanced AI tools and BPS platforms, while WNS has built a number of industry-specific BPS offerings.

Capgemini said the addition of WNS will act like a catalyst, transforming it into an intelligent operations leader, with both the required scale and unique capabilities ranging from strategy and transformation to horizontal and vertical sector expertise.

“The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities,” Ezzat said in a statement. “It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.”

Forrester Research Inc. analyst Charlie Dai told Computerworld that hybrid automation and agentic AI will be major priorities for enterprise decision makers in the next three years. He said WNS’s domain-specific AI agents and platforms such as its AI.Agentic suite and WNS Expirus will substantially improve Capgemini’s own agent-focused BPS offerings.

There’s also a strategic angle to the acquisition, said Everest Group Managing Partner Rajesh Ranjan. He pointed out that agentic AI is still a nascent technology, and that most implementations up until now are pilot projects.

“The key driver is less to do with the tools and software, but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table,” Ranjan told Computerworld. “This is a pre-requisite to develop and deploy real-world AI solutions.”

Capgemini said it expects the acquisition to be finalized by the end of the year, adding that it will be immediately accretive to both its revenue and its operating margin.

The markets didn’t react too kindly to the news, though. Capgemini’s stock fell 5% on Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index, as analysts from Morgan Stanley warned that the acquisition would have a negative effect on its balance sheet flexibility, without adding any significant revenue boost.

Franklin St. Starbucks voted 14-1 in favor of unionization, joining Starbucks Workers United, a national worker-led unionizing effort.
Store employees have also dealt with numerous safety issues.
“Our store is considered a high incidence store,” Washburne said.
So, the manager took it to Starbucks corporate, which resulted in security guards being temporarily implemented at the store, Washburne said.
The security guards were phased out after a few months and are no longer stationed at the store, Washburne said.","On June 30, workers at the 100 E. Franklin St. Starbucks voted 14-1 in favor of unionization, joining Starbucks Workers United, a national worker-led unionizing effort.

Earlier in June, the store’s baristas and shift supervisors sent a letter to upper management stating their intent to unionize, and they later read the letter aloud to the store manager and customers.

“We are not writing to ask for favors,” the letter said. “We are writing to demand dignity.”

The letter, addressed to Brian Niccol, Starbucks’ CEO, discussed the workers’ reasons for unionization, including reduced raises, unsustainable workloads and unsafe working conditions..

Unionization had been discussed previously without coming to fruition, Alexandria Washburne, a shift supervisor who has worked for Starbucks for six years, said. What specifically prompted this petition was a discussion with the store’s manager regarding availability, she said.

“[The store manager] told us in a shift meeting that we would either open our availability for one day — open-to-close Saturday or Sunday — or we could demote ourselves or we could transfer to a store that could accommodate our availability,” Washburne said.

Matthew Wynne, a shift supervisor who has worked for Starbucks for six years, said he had his availability and time-off requests denied several times in a row, an experience shared by multiple baristas at the store.

Store employees have also dealt with numerous safety issues. Wynne said that the store has called the police more than 100 times in the past year.

“Our store is considered a high incidence store,” Washburne said. “That's what they call it in the Starbucks language, meaning we have a lot of, I guess, ‘incidents,’ quote, unquote, that occur in the store.”

Employees said they have seen a man choking a woman outside the store, faced harassment from customers and witnessed someone stabbing a person’s hand with a pen in the store.

In response to the stabbing, the store’s previous manager asked the district manager to implement security guards. The district manager denied the request, Wynne said. So, the manager took it to Starbucks corporate, which resulted in security guards being temporarily implemented at the store, Washburne said.

The security guards were phased out after a few months and are no longer stationed at the store, Washburne said. She said employees received no communication from management regarding the guards’ removal.

“It just makes you feel unsafe to be at work in those situations,” Washburne said. “We're supposed to be making lattes, not breaking up fights.”

Ethan Gulledge, a barista at the Starbucks, said the policies of the Back to Starbucks plan — a corporate plan emphasizing policies like a dress code and writing on cups in order to revitalize the chain — have led to more upset customers.

“With this new policy of asking everybody if they've made a purchase to get the free water, people don't necessarily respond well to that when they're used to getting free water,” Gulledge said.

Gulledge said these policies are not feasible when the store experiences a high volume of customers, which can reach up to 160 people in half an hour.

The union prevents Starbucks from firing employees for union-related activities and secures employees’ right to collective bargaining and having union representatives.

“Any conversation that's going to have the result of disciplinary action, we have the right to have a representative there to bargain or argue for us,” Gulledge said.

Starbucks has not discussed the union’s contract in good faith, and a contract will not be signed until the company does so, Wynne said. Employees will not have to pay dues until a contract is signed, he said.

“This win shows that when partners come together and speak up, we can't be ignored,” Wynne said. “We didn't vote for this union just to make noise. We voted because we're tired of being mistreated and left out of the decisions that affect our lives in our day-to-day workplace.”

Murugesh echoed the sentiment, noting the shift from automation to autonomy as clients seek to embed AI into their operating models.

To finance the deal, Capgemini has secured bridge financing of euro 4 billion, covering the purchase price, WNS’s gross debt, and the redemption of a euro 0.8 billion bond due in June 2025. It plans to refinance the bridge through a mix of existing cash and new debt issuance.

Both companies emphasized their cultural alignment and history of successful integrations, which they believe will ensure a smooth transition. The deal is set to create a global leader in Digital BPS, uniquely positioned to support enterprises in their transformation into AI-powered businesses.

“As a recognized leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients. Organizations that have already digitized are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy,” said Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS.

WNS in India

Established by British Airways in Mumbai in 1996, WNS (Holdings) Ltd has grown into a major player in the global business process management (BPM) space, with India serving as the cornerstone of its operations. Headquartered in Vikhroli, Mumbai, WNS’s Indian presence spans 25 delivery centres across the country and employs close to 40,000 professionals. These centres blend large-scale transaction processing with high-value, domain-specific services through dedicated centres of excellence, making India integral to WNS’s global delivery strategy.

India contributes more than 50 per cent of WNS’s global revenue, highlighting its critical role in the company’s worldwide footprint. Key Indian cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Noida, Chennai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Indore, Nashik, Visakhapatnam (Vizag), and Hyderabad host its major operations.

In March 2024, WNS significantly expanded in Hyderabad, opening a 60,000-square-foot facility in Nanakramguda. The centre, designed to support digital transformation for sectors including shipping and logistics, healthcare, BFSI, and high-tech, employs around 1,400 people and operates in multiple shifts.

The Vizag delivery centre exemplifies WNS’s rapid growth in India. From fewer than 50 employees in 2012, the centre now houses over 3,300 staff, more than 2,000 of whom were added in just the past two years. It provides digital-first BPM services tailored to specific industries.

WNS’s Indian operations also include centres of excellence in key domains such as analytics, insurance, banking, finance and accounting, healthcare, travel, and logistics. This domain-led, technology-enabled model reinforces India’s role as the heart of WNS’s global service delivery engine.

French IT services firm Capgemini, which has more than half of its 3.4 lakh employees in India, is acquiring one of the country's business process management (BPM) pioneers, WNS, for $3.3 billion. The move is seen as an attempt to bring strong technology expertise, especially AI, into BPM services to be able to offer enterprises much more comprehensive solutions. This acquisition comes a decade after Capgemini acquired Igate, another India-based IT company, for $4 billion. The WNS deal underscores India's growing importance in Capgemini's global strategy. Over 44,000 of WNS' 65,000 employees are based in India. WNS, founded in 1996 and listed on NYSE, counts United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods among its key customers.

"" WNS has delivered an average constant currency revenue growth of over 9% over the past three fiscal years, reaching $1.2 billion in revenue in the 2025 financial year with an operating margin of 18.7%.

Looper Textile has been operational since 2023, but is ready to work on an industrial scale and process up to 150 million garments per year and send them for reuse and recycling.

The company is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and operates through three sorting facilities in Europe-two in Germany, in Hamburg and Polch, and one in Poland in Pila.

Garments are sorted into more than 200 categories, based on material and type of product. In 2023, Looper helped extend the useful life of more than 40 million garments. By 2024, the number has risen to more than 72 million garments, of which 65% are destined for reuse, 25% are sent for recycling, and less than 10% disposed of responsibly due to contamination.

“The need for textile collection and sorting solutions has never been more urgent, and Looper is uniquely positioned to generate concrete change,” says Erik Lagerblad, CEO, Looper Textile Co.

""Used textiles represent one of the largest material flows in the world. That's why we rely on digital solutions and our experience in the circular economy to efficiently coordinate the volumes collected. With an operational capacity of up to 150 million garments per year, Looper Textile stands as a key player in the sustainable management of textile streams globally. Together, we want to bring the sustainable use of textiles into the future,"" said Simon Bodmer, head of the Logistics Department at Remondis Recycling GmbH & Co. KG.

Among the services offered to support the initiative, the Rhenus Group provides advanced logistics solutions and services such as centralized coordination of transportation flows, end-to-end supply chain visibility, and implementation of a 4PL digital Control Tower, custom-designed to meet the specific needs of circular textile logistics.

The system was custom-designed to meet the specific needs of the circular economy, making it possible to reuse and recycle textiles through smooth coordination among all stakeholders.

“Our 4PL Control Tower provides a central platform for the integrated and coordinated management of all logistics activities, increasing visibility along the entire value chain,” explains Chris Gerfertz, managing global director, Rhenus 4PL Solutions.

Looper has also started a pilot line for automated sorting based on optical and infrared sensor technologies to meet the increasingly precise requirements of textile-to-textile recycling.

The Rhenus Group is a global logistics specialist, with annual sales of €8.2 billion. It has more than 41,000 active employees in 1,330 locations in more than 70 countries, and develops innovative solutions along the entire supply chain including activities such as transportation, warehousing, customs clearance or value-added services.

It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.
Carrier reported sales of $248 million in India last year, its highest level since at least the financial year ending March 2020.
Its filing said it installed India's first-ever air conditioning system in Jaipur city in 1936.","NEW DELHI: The Indian unit of U.S. air conditioning giant Carrier has become the latest major firm to sue Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over electronic waste rules that have hiked the fees manufacturers must pay to recyclers.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Japan's Daikin and Tata's Voltas have also brought suits, which are set to be heard by the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday. All of the companies are seeking to have the rules quashed.

India is the third-biggest generator of electronic waste behind China and the U.S., but the government says only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled.

Modi's government in September fixed a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, which manufacturers argue is roughly three to four times higher than what they paid earlier.

In a 380-page court filing dated June 3, which has not been disclosed publicly, Carrier said recyclers were willing to continue their work at the older prices and the government should not interfere in private dealings between companies and recyclers.

""The burden of the benefit being given to the recyclers has been put on the producers, which is unfair and arbitrary,"" said submissions by Carrier Airconditioning & Refrigeration which were reviewed by Reuters.

The submissions added that the rules will impose a ""huge financial burden"" on the company.

Carrier did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

India's Ministry of Environment also did not respond to Reuters queries. It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.

The new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics. Such rates are still lower than levels in the U.S where they are up to five times higher, according to research firm Redseer.

Still, tariffing imports from South Korea, America's sixth-largest trading partner, is particularly galling.
For starters, that's because the new tariffs seem to violate an existing trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea.
That deal, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, was signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush and implemented in 2012.
It's also silly because Trump himself signed a renegotiated version of that same trade deal in 2018.","If you still believe there is some overarching goal—new trade deals, negotiating for lower trade barriers, or whatever—to the Trump administration's trade policy agenda, Monday's announcement of new tariffs targeting imports from South Korea ought to put an end to all that.

South Korea was not the only country whose goods were hit with higher tariffs on Monday, nor does it seem likely to be the last. President Donald Trump also announced higher tariffs targeting imports from Japan, Myanmar, Laos, South Africa, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia. The White House indicated that Trump will be sending letters to other countries in the coming days announcing various tariff rates. This is, in effect, a slow-motion repeat of the ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements that were put on hold for 90 days in early April after the markets reacted negatively to those announcements.

Still, tariffing imports from South Korea, America's sixth-largest trading partner, is particularly galling. If Trump's goal here is to strike deals that will lower foreign barriers to American exports and deliver better trading conditions for American manufacturers (who rely on imports), then hiking tariffs on South Korea makes startlingly little sense.

For starters, that's because the new tariffs seem to violate an existing trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. That deal, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, was signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush and implemented in 2012. Under the terms of the deal, about 95 percent of the goods traded between the two countries are imported tariff-free. Among other things, that deal put an end to high South Korean tariffs on American cars and light trucks, which has boosted American exports and U.S. auto manufacturing jobs.

On the whole, the deal has been good for both countries. Bilateral trade between the U.S. and South Korea expanded nearly 70 percent in the first 10 years that the deal was in place. As The Heritage Foundation noted in 2022, the deal was particularly good for American farmers (who saw exports to South Korea hit record highs) and for foreign investment in American industries (South Korean investment in the U.S. nearly tripled during the deal's first decade in force).

Some Trump allies might argue that the current president has no obligation to respect deals signed by the Bush administration. That's silly, of course, since incoming presidents are expected to respect trade deals made by their predecessors. Indeed, if not for that expectation, trade deals would provide little long-term certainty for businesses in either country, as they could always be voided after the next election.

It's also silly because Trump himself signed a renegotiated version of that same trade deal in 2018. The so-called KORUS 2.0 rolled back some of the free trade provisions in the original deal—most notably, it limited exports of Korean steel to the U.S. and postponed a planned elimination of the U.S. tariff on imported light trucks.

Still, it was mostly ""a minor tweak"" to the previous deal, as the Cato Institute termed it at the time.

Trump called the reworked deal ""fair and reciprocal"" and said it was ""a historic milestone in trade.""

Now, less than seven years later, he's effectively torn up that deal. Or he's pretending that it never existed (or he forgot about it).

So, here's the question: What is the White House hoping to accomplish with this latest maneuver?

If the goal is to lower tariffs across the board, then KORUS already did that. If the goal is to increase American exports to foreign countries by getting them to lower their trade barriers, then KORUS has already done that too. If the goal is to allow Trump to renegotiate the supposedly flawed trade deals from previous generations of American leaders, then KORUS 2.0 did that.

And, of course, if the goal is to strike more deals with more countries—as the White House keeps claiming—then this seems to be a step in the wrong direction. What other leader will be willing to negotiate seriously with this administration, knowing full well that it does not respect the deals it reaches?",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/07/polspphotos582950-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 18:07:22.090756

For long-term holders, Merit's potential to expand margins through acquisitions and innovation could justify the premium—if execution meets expectations.
In short, Merit Medical's shift in leadership and Q2 momentum are positive signs, but investors must weigh the risks of overvaluation against the promise of execution.","The appointment of Martha Aronson as CEO of Merit Medical Systems (NASDAQ: MMS) marks a pivotal moment for the 38-year-old medical device manufacturer. Aronson's deep healthcare leadership experience—spanning roles at Ecolab, Hill-Rom, and Medtronic—aligns neatly with Merit's current priorities: expanding its portfolio through acquisitions, navigating regulatory approvals, and sustaining growth in a price-competitive medtech sector. Meanwhile, preliminary Q2 2025 revenue guidance of $380–384 million (up 12–14% YoY) signals momentum that could position the company for sustained value creation—if execution meets expectations.

Leadership Transition: A Smooth Handoff or Risky Bet?

Aronson succeeds founder Fred Lampropoulos, who remains as chairman, a move that aims to blend institutional knowledge with fresh strategic vision. Lampropoulos built Merit into a global leader in interventional medical devices, but the industry has evolved. Today's medtech landscape demands agility in M&A, regulatory compliance, and cost management—areas where Aronson's background stands out.

Her prior roles at Ecolab and Hill-Rom involved leading large-scale operations and international expansions, which may prove critical as Merit integrates its $120 million acquisition of Biolife Delaware L.L.C. That deal, completed earlier this year, is expected to add $10–11 million in annual revenue and improve margins by streamlining product offerings. Aronson's experience in scaling operations could accelerate the integration's success, a key near-term catalyst.

Q2 Guidance: A Strong Start, but What Lies Ahead?

The preliminary Q2 revenue figures—12–14% growth on a reported basis, 11–13% on a constant currency basis—reflect robust demand for Merit's core interventional devices. This outperformance in a quarter where many medtech peers are grappling with reimbursement pressures and pricing wars is notable. The company's reaffirmed full-year guidance of $1.48–1.50 billion in revenue (9–11% growth) suggests confidence in its execution.

The Biolife acquisition's contribution to 2025 revenue and its promised margin improvements by 2026 are critical to sustaining this trajectory. Additionally, the Health Canada approval of the WRAPSODY device opens a new revenue stream, with its WAVE trial demonstrating superior outcomes. Piper Sandler analysts highlighted this as a “key differentiator” in vascular access markets, though they noted the need for consistent quarterly results to maintain confidence.

Valuation and Risks: Is the Premium Warranted?

Merit's stock trades at a premium valuation relative to its peers, with a trailing P/E of ~25x and a price-to-sales ratio of 2.1x. This reflects investors' optimism about its long-term growth, but the question remains: Does the current valuation account for execution risks?

The Canaccord Genuity price target hike to $112 (from $108) and Piper Sandler's $110 target suggest Wall Street sees upside in Aronson's leadership and the Biolife synergies. However, risks loom large. Sector-wide pricing pressures—particularly in the U.S. hospital market—could crimp margins, while Merit's reliance on a few key products (e.g., its vascular access tools) leaves it vulnerable to regulatory setbacks or competitive innovations.

Moreover, recent insider sales—though attributed to M&A timing—could spook investors if not paired with consistent earnings beats. The July 30 Q2 results will be a critical test: missing estimates could reignite concerns about the premium multiple.

Investment Takeaway: Buy the Dip, or Wait for Clarity?

Merit Medical presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to a medtech firm with a strong balance sheet (current ratio of 4.87) and near-term catalysts. Aronson's track record and the strategic moves under her watch—Biolife integration, WRAPSODY commercialization—suggest the company is positioned to capitalize on its strengths.

Historical data reinforces this perspective: since 2022, MMS has averaged a 0.37% return in the days following earnings releases, with a 50% win rate over three and ten-day periods, though this moderates to 42.86% over 30 days. This short-term outperformance aligns with the article's emphasis on the July 30 earnings as a catalyst for upward momentum, though investors should anticipate potential volatility beyond the immediate post-report period.

The stock's premium valuation leaves little room for error. Investors should consider buying on dips below $95, with a focus on the July 30 results as a key milestone. For long-term holders, Merit's potential to expand margins through acquisitions and innovation could justify the premium—if execution meets expectations. However, the broader medtech sector's challenges—pricing pressures, regulatory uncertainty—demand caution.

In short, Merit Medical's shift in leadership and Q2 momentum are positive signs, but investors must weigh the risks of overvaluation against the promise of execution. Stay tuned to the earnings call and margin improvements in 2026 for clarity.",,N,,2025-07-07 19:04:02.199818

What’s the newest addition to McDonald’s breakfast menu?

READER'S DIGEST, COURTESY MCDONALD'S

Get ready to turn up the heat—McDonald’s is rolling out their all-new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches, and they’re every bit as bold as they sound. Picture this: melty cheese, a freshly cracked egg, savory Canadian bacon and what McDonald’s calls “a perfectly towered and buttered English muffin.”

Now here’s the summer-hot twist: Each sandwich gets a kick from McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce. And that’s not all—spice lovers can also sink their teeth into the Spicy Sausage McMuffin and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

According to McDonald’s, “Whether you’re fueling up for a morning marathon of meetings or just need something delicious to kickstart your day, these breakfast sandwiches deliver big, bold flavors.”

When will the Spicy McMuffin be available?

Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches will launch on July 8. They’ll be available at select locations nationwide, so be sure to check in with your local Golden Arches to see if they’re part of the initial roll-out.

How are people reacting to the news?

McDonald’s fans on Reddit have already started commenting about the upcoming McDonald’s menu additions. Some love that the new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches have the same sauce as other Mickey D’s menu favorites, with one Reddit user saying, “I love the sauce from the Spicy McCrispy, and I love the Sausage, Egg and Cheese McMuffin (the most perfect breakfast sandwich), so this is good enough for me.”

Under food reviewer Snackolator’s Instagram post about the news, one McDonald’s regular commented that their “stomach is bubblin with excitement,” while others are calling for more spicy menu items, specifically a spicy Chicken McGriddle.

How long will the Spicy McMuffin be sticking around?

We don’t know for sure. McDonald’s does, however, describe the drop as “a limited-time glow-up,” stating on their website: “Just like your social media stories, the Spicy McMuffin won’t last forever.” So don’t wait too long to try a Spicy McMuffin. It might just be the spicy start you need to get through the day.

Items involved in the Costco recall

Anker Power Bank

After the Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 was reviewed, a potential issue was detected involving the lithium-ion battery cell, which was sourced from a single vendor. Costco noted that the likelihood of a malfunction is minimal, but the company has decided to initiate a global voluntary recall of several models.

The Anker PowerCore 10000 power bank (Model A1263) also underwent a voluntary recall, issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), due to concerns about the lithium-ion batteries inside the product. The battery inside the power bank could overheat, which may lead to melted plastic components, smoke, or fire. The recalled model was sold between June 1, 2016 and December 31, 2022.

Danby Window Air Conditioner

A recall notice for the Danby 8k U-shaped window Air Conditioner noted that some units may not drain water quickly enough, which may lead to mold inside the unit. The recall advises consumers to stop using the unit immediately. The CPSC also included that the unit was sold across various retailers, including Midea, Frigidaire, Keystone, LBG Products, and Sea Breeze, among others.

The recall includes units purchased between June 10, 2021 and February 2, 2022.

The Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires, size 235/40R19, included in the recall are said to be missing a Department of Transportation (DOT) certification seal, although the tires comply with the requirements. Tires manufactured between June 2, 2024 and June 22, 2024 are subject to the recall.

Bowflex Adjustable Dumbbells

The Bowflex 552 Adjustable Dumbbells are being recalled due to reports of their weighted plates dislodging from the handle, posing a hazard to the user. The notice mentioned that consumers should immediately stop using the BowFlex model and return the item to a local Costco for a full refund.

Igloo Rolling Cooler

A recall notice for the Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler, purchased between January 2020 and January 2025, presents a risk that the product’s tow handle pinches consumers’ fingertips against the cooler. The notice stated that finger injuries from the cooler may result in fingertip amputation and a crushing hazard. Igloo announced it will provide redesigned tow handles to consumers.

The Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer purchased between May 2019 and May 2021 is included in the recall after consumers reported severe burn injuries.

By reshaping its leadership and doubling down on high-growth sectors in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, the bank aims to reignite shareholder value. Recent moves—including the appointment of co-CEOs and sector specialists—suggest Barclays is positioning itself to capitalize on tech, infrastructure, and green finance opportunities while slashing costs. But can this pivot turn the tide for a stock that has languished behind peers? Let's explore.

The Leadership Overhaul: A Blend of Tech and Global Banking Expertise

Barclays' most significant shift is the elevation of Craig Bright and Anne Marie Darling as Group Co-Chief Operating Officers and Barclays Execution Services Co-Chief Executive Officers. This dual leadership structure merges two critical strengths:

- Craig Bright, formerly Group CIO, brings 30 years of tech expertise, having spearheaded digital transformation across consumer and wholesale banking. His focus on cloud infrastructure and AI integration aligns with Barclays' push into high-margin tech financing.

- Anne Marie Darling, a Goldman Sachs veteran with 25 years in global sales and execution services, adds depth to cross-border client relationships—a linchpin for success in APAC's fragmented markets.

Together, they are tasked with streamlining operations to reduce costs by £2 billion by 2026. This includes slashing the cost-to-income ratio to the “high 50s” from 67% in 2024. Initial results are promising: Q1 2025 pre-tax profits rose 19% to £2.7 billion, with the investment bank hitting a 16% ROE, its highest in years.

APAC and Middle East: The New Growth Frontier

Barclays is betting big on Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, where infrastructure spending and green finance are booming. Key leadership appointments include:

- Avinash Thakur, Head of APAC Investment Banking, who will spearhead M&A and debt financing in markets like India and Singapore.

- Ee-Ching Tay, now Head of APAC M&A, expanding her role in Southeast Asia.

- Arun Saigal and Pramod Kumar in India, focusing on energy transition projects and corporate financing.

These hires reflect a strategic focus on sectors with stable margins and growth potential:

1. Tech and Infrastructure: Supporting deals like data centers and smart cities.

2. Green Finance: Advising on renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind farms in the North Sea and solar investments in India.

3. Middle East Ties: Leveraging Dubai and Abu Dhabi's role as hubs for energy and tech investments.

Barclays' shares have lagged peers, trading at a P/E of 7.73—far below UK banks' average of ~10. This undervaluation creates an entry point if APAC strategies deliver market share gains.

Risks and the Case for Caution

Debt Exposure: Barclays' debt-to-equity ratio of 1.45 remains elevated, requiring careful management amid rising interest rates.

Execution Risk: APAC's regulatory complexity could delay profit growth. For instance, Pramod Kumar's Vice Chairman role in India is pending regulatory approval.

Geopolitical Headwinds: U.S.-China trade tensions and Middle East political risks could disrupt corporate financing pipelines.

The Investment Thesis: A Value Play with Catalysts

Barclays' stock trades at a 3.84% dividend yield, offering income stability while growth strategies play out. Analysts like Morgan Stanley have raised price targets to 350 GBp, implying a ~20% upside from current levels. Key catalysts include:

1. APAC Market Share Growth: Success in winning mandates for tech IPOs or green infrastructure deals.

2. Cost Cuts Delivering ROE Targets: Achieving a 14% ROE by 2026 would re-rate the stock significantly.

3. Debt Reduction Progress: Improving leverage metrics could attract risk-averse investors.

Final Verdict: Buy the Dip, but Monitor Closely

Barclays' leadership reshuffle and APAC focus present a compelling value proposition. The stock's undervaluation, dividend yield, and potential for margin expansion make it a speculative buy for investors willing to ride near-term volatility. However, success hinges on executing its cost-cutting and capturing market share in high-growth sectors. Monitor Q3 2025 results for progress on APAC revenue and cost savings.

If Barclays hits its 14% ROE target, its valuation could align with peers, unlocking ~40% upside. For now, this is a high-risk, high-reward bet—but one worth considering in a diversified portfolio.

Investment Grade: BB (Speculative)

Price Target: £16.50 (350 GBp) by end-2025

Hold for: 12-18 months, with upside tied to APAC execution.

The Teamsters accused UPS of violating their national contract and trying to ""weasel"" out of commitments to create new full-time union jobs.
UPS drivers are among the highest paid in the country, with strong retirement perks under the union contract.
He added that ""she’s not gonna push around the Teamsters.” UPS previously offered buyouts to corporate-level employees in 2020 to trim payroll.","UPS is taking heat over a dramatic move that could shrink its delivery force, and possibly the number of trucks on the road.

The company is under fire as workers brace for what could be a drastic reduction in deliveries across the country.

UPS is offering buyouts to full-time drivers for the first time in its 117-year history.

The program, quietly rolled out Thursday, comes as executives cite “an unprecedented business landscape"" in a new statement.

UPS, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, said drivers could voluntarily leave the company in exchange for a financial package.

The move sparked outrage from the Teamsters union, which represents roughly 340,000 UPS workers.

“Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out,” Teamsters President Sean M. O’Brien said in a statement.

The Teamsters accused UPS of violating their national contract and trying to ""weasel"" out of commitments to create new full-time union jobs.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts,” O’Brien said.

Under the 2023 contract, UPS agreed to create 22,500 full-time positions and add another 7,500 over the final three years of the deal.

The union claims UPS's proposed Driver Voluntary Severance Plan (DVSP) threatens those job guarantees.

It also warns the program could strip retirees of key benefits, including health insurance.

UPS drivers are among the highest paid in the country, with strong retirement perks under the union contract.

“UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect,” O’Brien added.

According to UPS, the buyout is optional and won't impact existing retirement packages, including pensions and healthcare.

Each driver would ""have the ability to decide if this voluntary program is beneficial to their family,"" the company stated.

UPS insists it is honoring its 2023 contract and has spoken with the Teamsters about the plan.

The company is also in the middle of what it called ""the largest network reconfiguration in UPS history.""

Earlier this year, UPS revealed it would cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 buildings to save costs.

In January, it slashed its agreement with Amazon, its top client, cutting shipment volume by more than half through 2026.

The Teamsters say the new buyout plan hasn’t been fully disclosed to members yet and warn it’s “illegal.”

They have demanded data from UPS on open positions and delivery vans, including air-conditioned vehicles promised under the current contract.

UPS has so far failed to respond to the union’s request and asked for more time, the Teamsters claim.

“They can’t force anything on us,” Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said.

Zuckerman also called out UPS CEO, Carol Tomé , saying she could ""screw over her own team.""

He added that ""she’s not gonna push around the Teamsters.”

Second Quarter 2025 Preliminary Revenue Results

Merit also announced preliminary unaudited revenue in the range of approximately $380 to $384 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, a projected increase of approximately 12% to 14% compared to revenue reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Preliminary constant currency revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, increased in the range of approximately 11% to 13% compared to the prior year period. Constant currency revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below.

As previously announced on July 3, 2025, Merit plans to release its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, after the close of the stock market on Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Merit plans to hold its investor conference call on the same day (Wednesday, July 30, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

A link to both register for the conference call and view the webcast will be made available at www.merit.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Although Merit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP”), Merit’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue referenced in this release may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Merit’s ongoing operations and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.

Merit’s management team uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate Merit’s financial performance generally, to compare operating and financial results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Readers should consider the non-GAAP measure used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure generally excludes some, but not all, items that may affect Merit’s revenue. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges readers to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure included herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.

Constant Currency Revenue

Merit’s constant currency revenue is prepared by converting the current-period preliminary unaudited revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period and adjusting for the effects of hedging transactions on preliminary unaudited revenue, which are recorded in the U.S. dollar. The preliminary constant currency revenue adjustment of $(2.3) million to preliminary unaudited revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation

The following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of non-GAAP preliminary constant currency revenue to Merit’s corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

Which recalled Costco items should you stop using immediately?

PIMPAMPIX/STOCK.ADOBE.COM

Costco included more than a dozen items on its recall list from various manufacturers, but the five below are the most potentially dangerous. Here’s what the retailer is advising customers to remove them from their homes immediately, and why:

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires: While Costco is indeed a great place to buy tires, Michelin tires sized 185/60R15C are under recall. According to Michelin, “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block,” which could increase the risk of a crash.

Anker Powercore 1000 Power Bank: These power banks have a risk of overheating, and “this could lead to melting of plastic components, smoke or fire,” according to Anker in its recall letter.

Danby 8k U-Shape Window Air Conditioner: If you purchased this air conditioner between June 10, 2021, and Feb. 2, 2022, it may be harboring toxic mold—and blowing it through your house along with all that cold air this summer. “Pooled water in the air containers can fail to drain quickly enough, which can lead to mold growth,” Danby explained. The company notes that mold can cause respiratory issues or infections, especially for sensitive individuals.

Midea U-Shape Window AC: Similar to the issue above, this Midea window air conditioner has drainage issues that can cause mold growth.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler: Customers who bought this cooler between January 2020 and January 2025 should stop using it immediately. Why? There’s “a risk that the tow handle can pinch consumers’ fingertips against the cooler, posing fingertip amputation and crushing hazards,” the brand notes. Yikes!

What other items has Costco recalled?

While we called out the items with the most urgent risks above, many of the ones below are still problematic, as you’ll see. Give your home a thorough check, and if you find these items, stop using them ASAP.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells: The weight plates can dislodge from the handle when you’re using these dumbbells, which could pose “an impact hazard.”

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires: Bridgestone is recalling these tires because they were sold as “replacement equipment only.” Plus, “they do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 139.”

Anker Power Bank: There’s “a potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells from a single vendor.” Anker has deemed the likelihood of malfunction minimal, but the company has still issued “a voluntary global recall,” just in case.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass: Coca-Cola is voluntarily recalling a limited number of these glasses due to “the possibility of contamination with pseudomonas.”

Fresh & Ready Foods Prepared Sandwiches and Salads: Fresh & Ready Foods is recalling some of its ready-to-eat sandwiches—specifically, ones sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington. This voluntary recall is due to a possible listeria contamination.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer: Some customers have reported that the lids open while the pressure cooker is being used, which can lead to “severe burn injuries from hot contents.”

Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter: The problem here is a potential failure of the folding mechanism, which can lead to falls.

Sublue Underwater Scooter: Underwater scooters purchased between June 2018 and March 2024 are being recalled due to battery malfunctions.

Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu: The caplets with the lot code P140082 are being recalled due to their accidental release and shipment. According to Kirkland, they “may have foreign material contamination.”

What should you do if you have one of these items?

If you own one of these items, it’s important to stop using it right away. We know it can be tough, especially if it’s something you’ve used for a while, but you shouldn’t chance it, since the product could malfunction at any time.

In addition to discontinuing use, check the brand’s website for more details about the recall. You can also visit Costco’s recall page for brand contact info and next steps. Some brands provide guidance on how to inspect the product to determine if it’s still safe to use, so it’s worth a look.

Will Costco give you a refund for these items?

Yes, but typically only if you have a Costco membership. And if you’re a Costco member, there’s more good news: A receipt is not always required. Just having your membership card or number should do the trick, since Costco keeps your receipts in its system for years—yes, years!

In lieu of a refund from Costco, there is another option: Some of the brands offer free repair kits, full refunds or prorated refunds, depending on when you bought the item or when it was made. The bottom line? You have options, so make sure to explore them before throwing in the towel—and throwing out your recalled item.

These events are no longer challenges only for operations or safety teams. They’re driving real increases in healthcare claims and exposing gaps in benefits strategy—and should be an increased focus for HR and benefits leaders.

To help employers prepare, Mercer and the National Commission on Climate and Workforce Health have launched a new digital tool: the Climate Health Cost Forecaster. The tool gives employers their first clear line of sight into how climate-related health risks—such as extreme heat, poor air quality, flooding and hurricanes—could increase healthcare costs for their populations over the next decade.

For benefits leaders trying to manage plan design, anticipate cost drivers and align across regions, this kind of data is increasingly essential.

Why rising climate health costs matter for benefits teams

Employers today are already facing rising medical costs, and many are looking for new ways to contain costs without cutting coverage. What’s often overlooked is how climate-related health risks are quietly compounding the problem, especially in industries or geographies with higher exposure, and that these risks are growing.

The Forecaster, built by Mercer, offers customized, ZIP code-level projections based on a company’s workforce size, industry and percentage of employees working in climate-controlled environments. It draws on historical weather data, epidemiological research and Mercer’s proprietary claims database to estimate when and where employers may face increased spending from climate-related health conditions—ranging from heat stroke to respiratory illness to mental health impacts.

Key insights include:

For employees not working in a climate-controlled environment, the incremental cost of climate-related health impacts is 40% higher on average than for those working in climate-controlled settings.

Industries like construction, agriculture and utilities may face up to 2x greater exposure to incremental healthcare costs than other sectors.

Employers with significant headcount in metro areas such as New York, Boston, Phoenix and Charlotte are projected to see 5x higher climate-related healthcare claims.

These aren’t abstract trends—they’re cost drivers that can and should be factored into budgeting, plan forecasting and location-specific health and wellbeing strategies.

From visibility to action

The Forecaster helps bridge the gap between rising environmental risks and rising claims costs. For HR and benefits leaders, it provides a data-backed way to start internal conversations—whether with finance, risk, sustainability, operations or facilities teams—about this emerging dimension of healthcare cost trends and associated mitigation strategies.

The tool also allows employers to model how climate risk could contribute to a 1% or greater increase in annual healthcare spend over the next decade, which could translate to millions in additional costs for many organizations. With this data, companies can benchmark projected exposure, compare across regions, and prioritize interventions that lower risk.

Despite the growing exposure, few companies have addressed this risk strategically. According to research from Mercer, fewer than one in five CEOs say their organizations have a clear plan to protect employees from climate-related health risks. And yet, 76% of employers say severe weather has affected their employees—whether through heat, air quality or severe weather disruptions.

New polling from the Commission and Northwind Climate illustrates how this is transforming into an HR risk: Forty-three percent of employees say an employer’s ability to respond to these threats influences whether they stay long term.

Planning ahead, building resilience

The Forecaster can also support broader strategy conversations—such as where to build new sites, how to evaluate relocations or how to adapt benefits offerings by region. It enables employers to assess which specific perils pose the greatest risk in each location. In some cities, heat is the dominant factor; in others, air quality or flooding are more likely to drive higher costs. These insights can guide smarter, more tailored decisions.

For example:

In high-heat areas, if not already mandated, companies may consider heat-safety policies, cooling benefits or modified working hours to help employees avoid the hottest times of the day.

In wildfire-prone areas, employers might offer respiratory education and support for flexible work arrangements.

In flood zones, business continuity planning may include alternatives for accessing healthcare and other benefits as well as disaster relief.

Proactive investments like these can not only reduce claims and absenteeism but also improve retention and workforce engagement—especially among employees who expect visible action on environmental sustainability.

From insights to innovation: How leading employers are responding

Understanding the risks is essential, but the real opportunity lies in taking action. It is typical for companies to have some policies in place to support climate resiliency; in fact, a recent Mercer survey found that 66% of large employers (those with 500 or more employees) have one or more policies or programs in place to address climate risks for the workforce, up from 53% last year (2024). However, only a few have done a vulnerability assessment to understand which employees are most at risk.

Leading companies are already pioneering policies to safeguard employees and operations from climate disruption.

For example, Adobe introduced a Disaster and Epidemic Time Off policy, granting paid time off to workers affected by events that trigger a state of emergency. Public entities and employers are also offering subsidies for home heat pumps, a greener HVAC alternative that reduces emissions and boosts indoor air quality for employees at home by filtering air and regulating temperature.

Policy is moving quickly in some places. In Spain, a law now gives employees up to four paid “climate leave” days when extreme weather makes commuting unsafe. And in the U.S., Minnesota’s Earned Sick and Safe Time law requires employers to provide leave that covers situations like workplace closures due to weather emergencies.

Rising to the occasion

Innovative companies have the opportunity to meet this moment. Employers can expand disaster response policies—quickly approving pharmacy refills during crises, fast-tracking disability claims, offering emergency relief funds and scaling telemedicine during wildfires or floods. Many are further reducing risk exposure through on-the-ground adaptations: installing cooling stations, updating filtration systems, implementing flexible shift schedules, educating employees on the risks they face and enabling remote work during air quality alerts or heat waves.

These investments yield measurable benefits, including reduced absenteeism, lower claims, stronger talent retention and improved morale. They also demonstrate to employees that the company values their safety and wellbeing. Employers that integrate climate resilience into benefits, facilities and operational planning position themselves to outpace their peers.

New resources for a growing challenge

The Climate Health Cost Forecaster is one of several tools available through the National Commission on Climate and Workforce Health, a cross-sector initiative presented by Mercer and supported by Elevance Health and The Hartford.

In addition to the Forecaster, the Commission provides resources on extreme heat, air quality and climate-related mental health challenges—offering practical steps HR and benefits leaders can take today.

Two additional tools can help employers move from awareness to action. The new Climate and Worker Health Scorecard allows organizations to assess how well their current policies, benefits and preparedness strategies address climate-driven risks. Developed by Mercer with support from the commission, the Scorecard guides teams through a review of the policies and programs currently in place to protect workers from climate-related health risks and support them in weather emergencies, and immediately delivers a report with their score. This process can help employers identify new opportunities to safeguard worker health and wellbeing as climate risks intensify. Explore the Scorecard here.

For those just getting started, check out Managing Extreme Weather and Climate Risks at Work, a playbook designed specifically for HR and benefits leaders. The guide offers a practical, four-step plan to help companies prepare for extreme climate conditions, protect their teams and build long-term resilience.

This summer, the commission is hosting a series of virtual events focused on extreme heat and workforce health. The sessions will feature new research, expert perspectives and strategies to help HR, operations, and Environmental, Health and Safety leaders address the rising risks and costs associated with heat exposure. The next session takes place from 1-2 p.m. ET on July 30. Secure your seat here.

The bottom line for HR and benefits leaders

Climate risks aren’t theoretical; they are already affecting employee health and productivity and impacting medical claims. Nor are they a problem to deal with in the future: Heat waves, wildfires and hurricanes are expected to intensify this summer.

With healthcare costs continuing to rise, benefits professionals need every available tool to get ahead of emerging risks.

Capgemini declined to discuss further details of the planned acquisition of WNS in response to a CRN request.

However, in an analyst conference call after news of the acquisition was released, Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat (pictured above) said in his prepared remarks that the transaction targets the growing need for AI capabilities.

“This transaction positions the group as a leader in the emerging market of intelligent operation, which is the most significant opportunity for our clients to create value in the era of GenAI and agentic AI,” Ezzat said. “The strategic value of this transaction lies in the complementarity of capabilities and expertise between Capgemini and WNS to provide intelligent operations at scale.”

Ezzat said Capgemini expects the integration of the two companies’ business services global capabilities to be straightforward based on the cultural fit and complementarity of capability.

The $3.3 billion acquisition, which was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close by the end of 2025, Ezzat said.

Capgemini plans to finance the acquisition with about 1 billion Euros of available cash plus 4 billion Euros in bridge funding.

The acquisition comes at the right time for Capgemini and WNS, Ezzat said.

“Since the advent of ChatGPT and GenAI, enterprises have focused significant attention and increasing amounts of investment around GenAI, and more broadly, AI,” he said. “Clients today better comprehend what the technology can actually deliver. Their focus is shifting from individual productivity to the transformation of end-to-end business processes.”

Large enterprises want to invest in agentic AI to change how they operate for both efficiency and growth, Ezzat said.

“It is the realization that end-to-end business processes provide the background to fully leverage the power of GenAI and agentic AI,” he said. “It is a unique opportunity to make AI real and reap its expected benefits.”

Capgemini started investing in GenAI over five years ago, building over 25 strategic partnerships, upskilling its staff, and developing a wide portfolio of offerings, and in the process became a leader in GenAI and agentic AI, with data and AI becoming one of the company’s core pillars, Ezzat said.

“With GenAI, bookings are already hitting 900 million euros last year,” he said. “Clients rely on Capgemini and their business and technology partners for the GenAI transformation journey.”

The last 12 months have seen a significant increase in client interest in the revolution of business process services driven by agentic AI, Ezzat said.

“We are convinced that intelligent operations, which is a consulting-led approach to transform and operate business processes leveraging GenAI and agentic AI, will be the primary showcase for agentic AI in terms of value creation,” he said. “This is about making GenAI and agentic AI real for our clients.”

Business process services, or BPS, have over the last 20 years shifted from a focus on cost reduction to things like robotic process automation and digital platforms, Ezzat said.

“Intelligent operation is the next revolution in the BPS market,” he said. “It includes consulting-led business process transformation, leveraging GenAI and agentic AI. It provides clients with efficiency, speed, and agility through process hyper automation at scale while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI, and digital. Client focus has shifted from cost and efficiency to agility, speed, and significantly better business outcomes. This is about value creation. In parallel, the BPS market is shifting away from its labor-based drivers to being consulting-led and tech-driven.”

Intelligence operation requires strategy and transformation, consulting, deep technology expertise, and in-depth knowledge of horizontal and sector processes to deliver end-to-end process transformation, blending advanced agentic AI agents, custom GenAI assistance, enterprise data, data platform and management, and digital solutions, Ezzat said.

“Capgemini has essentially all the ingredients to answer its clients’ need for intelligent operation,” he said. “It is about scaling BPS. It’s about industry knowledge. It’s about leading in intelligent operation. This is the real strategic value of this transaction.”

WNS is a global leader in digital business process services operating at scale with deep industry and process expertise, with offerings powered by a comprehensive stack of solutions and platforms and fueled by a set of data and analytics solutions, Ezzat said.

“Their vertical industry specific expertise supports over 40 percent of their revenue, while data and analytics contributes 13 percent, underscoring WNS’ commitment to data and insight-led business process transformation,” he said.

WNS and its 65,000 employees serve a blue-chip client base with clients including United Airlines, U.K.-based Centrica, MNC Bank, and McCain Foods, Ezzat said. Nearly half the company’s revenue comes from North America, he said.

“WNS brings deep industry expertise through outcome-based platforms tailored to key verticals for every industry it serves,” he said. “WNS has developed and deployed proprietary platforms that deliver measurable value to its clients. This includes, for example, WNS Malkom. It’s an end-to-end AI-powered shipment documentation platform. It automates bills of lading, invoices, and consignment notes, turning core manual and error-prone processes into digital workflows. … Malkom intelligent architecture is delivering 40 [percent] to 60 percent productivity gains, ROI of up to four times, and 99 percent data accuracy, also reducing invoicing disputes by 20 percent and cutting documentation cycle times.”

Because of the complementary capabilities, offerings, and clients, the acquisition immediately unlocks cross-selling opportunities, Ezzat said.

“[We will] fully leverage the extensive portfolio of Capgemini service offerings with WNS clients, mainly in the U.S. and the U.K.,” he said. “We also see a great opportunity to leverage WNS’ digital BPS offerings, notably its platform and sector expertise in our client base. You can think about banking and insurance clients, for example, where today we can benefit from their vertical process capabilities.”

The combined company will be differentiated in its data and AI capabilities, Ezzat said.

“We have invested in talent, innovation, and [an] ecosystem of strategic partners,” he said. “Our approach is industry-specific and AI-powered. All these capabilities will be supported by an extended delivery network that brings scale and geographic diversity enabling global reach. Together, we have a unique set of capabilities that enable end-to-end business process transformation.”

The acquisition is strategic to both Capgemini and WNS, Ezzat said.

“We share the same vision of the market and the fast-emerging opportunity around intelligent operation driven by GenAI and agentic AI,” he said. “We are convinced that the complementarity of our capabilities and offerings will position Capgemini as the leader in this fast-emerging intelligent operation market, while providing great cross-selling revenue.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/media_10f2e7881be914d776295766296820d9bbfd09822.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:23.793064

Second Quarter 2025 Preliminary Revenue ResultsMerit also announced preliminary unaudited revenue in the range of approximately $380 to $384 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, a projected increase of approximately 12% to 14% compared to revenue reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Preliminary constant currency revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, increased in the range of approximately 11% to 13% compared to the prior year period. Constant currency revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below.

As previously announced on July 3, 2025, Merit plans to release its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, after the close of the stock market on Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Merit plans to hold its investor conference call on the same day (Wednesday, July 30, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

Non-GAAP Financial MeasureAlthough Merit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Merit’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue referenced in this release may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Merit’s ongoing operations and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.

Merit’s management team uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate Merit’s financial performance generally, to compare operating and financial results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Readers should consider the non-GAAP measure used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure generally excludes some, but not all, items that may affect Merit’s revenue. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges readers to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure included herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.

Constant Currency RevenueMerit’s constant currency revenue is prepared by converting the current-period preliminary unaudited revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period and adjusting for the effects of hedging transactions on preliminary unaudited revenue, which are recorded in the U.S. dollar. The preliminary constant currency revenue adjustment of $(2.3) million to preliminary unaudited revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure ReconciliationThe following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of non-GAAP preliminary constant currency revenue to Merit’s corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

The move comes as retailers across the UK explore a range of security measures to tackling rising retail crime.
In February, Tesco unveiled a new multimillion-pound security hub in Daventry, Northamptonshire, as part of a major investment to tackle the growing problem of retail crime across its UK stores.
The Auror platform allows the company to gather and share relevant information on retail crime with local police and other retailers.
In January, the BRC’s annual crime survey also found that retail crime is at the highest level on record with losses reaching £2.2 billion.","Swedish fashion brand H&M is reportedly testing body cameras across three UK stores in a bid to tackle growing retail crime.

The retailer told The Mail on Sunday that it is trialling the technology in one store in Edinburgh and two in London.

“We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers,” an H&M spokesperson told This is Money over the weekend.

The move comes as retailers across the UK explore a range of security measures to tackling rising retail crime.

In May, Currys has announced its largest ever investment in in-store security with the rollout of headsets at stores nationwide.

The move follows a successful trial of the VoCoVo developed technology in 20 stores.

The headsets aim to help staff stay better connected and therefore safer on the shop floor amidst the rise in shoplifting and abuse incidents across the retail industry.

In February, Tesco unveiled a new multimillion-pound security hub in Daventry, Northamptonshire, as part of a major investment to tackle the growing problem of retail crime across its UK stores.

The high-tech centre, which operates 24 hours a day throughout the year, analyses thousands of hours of CCTV footage to target shoplifters and protect staff from violence.

Security operators have been assigned responsibility for monitoring specific groups of stores across the UK.

bp has also rolled out a crime intelligence platform across its 300 company-owned stores and has provided staff with body cameras at 70 locations.

The Auror platform allows the company to gather and share relevant information on retail crime with local police and other retailers.

H&M's trial comes after figures from the British Retail Consortium published in March revealed that nearly a quarter of the UK population have witnessed shoplifting taking place while at a shop in the last 12 months.

The organisation also found that around 23 per cent of customers have seen the physical or verbal abuse of staff including racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.

In January, the BRC’s annual crime survey also found that retail crime is at the highest level on record with losses reaching £2.2 billion.

It also showed that there were over 2,000 incidents of violence and abuse over 2023-2024, more than triple the levels recorded in 2020.

Separately, shopworkers’ union Usdaw, has produced its own research which shows 77 per cent of retail staff experience abuse, with 53 per cent on the receiving end of threats and 10 per cent experiencing assault.",https://nationaltechnology.co.uk/images/H&M Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:47.257654

In particular, it said techniques to minimize income tax, estate tax, and gift tax should be treated as a core part of the business sale process, which the report encouraged business owners to ""begin planning early"" for.
But following the frantic and tense budget reconciliation process at Capitol Hill, small business owners will now have a more substantial $15 million exemption to work with.
""This permanent increase offers significant planning opportunities for high-net-worth business owners looking to optimize succession strategies,"" she says.
Philanthropic business owners could also potentially take advantage of the scholarship granting organization credit under the OBBA.","To describe the past few months' worth of news over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which has now officially been signed into law, one might consider butchering that famous Shakespearean phrase: ""full of sound and fury, signifying not much.""

That last part is certainly up for debate, especially for critics blasting the additional $3.3 trillion burden the bill would add to the deficit over the next decade, or the cuts it introduces into Medicaid. But the weeks leading up to the legislation's passage have definitely been furious.

For weeks after the House version the bill squeaked through by one vote in May, progress on the Senate version was stalled by holdouts objecting to its proposed Medicaid cuts and the cap on the SALT deduction. Last week, a marathon voting session in the Upper House ended in another deadlock, prompting Vice President JD Vance to cast a tiebreaking vote.

When all was said and done, the tax break package President Donald Trump approved in a splashy July 4 signing event at the White House didn't depart in any world-shaking way from his first signature 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

In other words, it's now safe for advisors to tell their high-net-worth business owner clients not to panic over their exit planning – at least, not more than usual – while highlighting a couple of interesting opportunities.

""I think it's business as usual, where they use the same techniques they've always used,"" Jere Doyle, a senior vice president and estate planning strategist at BNY Mellon, said in an interview with InvestmentNews. ""If there were drastic changes in the tax law, I'd give you a different answer.""

A recently published BNY Wealth Study stressed tax as a crucial issue for private business owners, calling it ""a constantly evolving area."" In particular, it said techniques to minimize income tax, estate tax, and gift tax should be treated as a core part of the business sale process, which the report encouraged business owners to ""begin planning early"" for.

A bigger estate tax exemption

According to Doyle, one of the report's authors, many advisors and estate planning experts have spent the last three to four years urging clients to use their $14 million estate tax exemption from the TCJA, which would have reverted to $7 million assuming Trump's first-term tax cuts expired this year. But following the frantic and tense budget reconciliation process at Capitol Hill, small business owners will now have a more substantial $15 million exemption to work with.

Jenny Giemza, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, notes that the extra $1 million of relief for business owners will take effect in 2026, with inflation-indexed adjustments to be applied moving forward. Married couples, she adds, could potentially shield an extra $2 million by using the portability provision of the exemption.

""This permanent increase offers significant planning opportunities for high-net-worth business owners looking to optimize succession strategies,"" she says.

Because many of Doyle's clients have businesses worth more than $15 million, he and his team go through numerous potential alternative strategies for them to shield their stock from estate taxes.

One option, he says, is to sell the stock to a grantor trust in exchange for a promissory note. Because the value of the note doesn't fluctuate with the markets, the business owner would be able to effectively freeze the value of their business within their estate, while any appreciation of the stock would accrue to the trust for the benefit of their children.

""That's been the bread-and-butter strategy to get the value of a business out of the estate before it appreciates,"" Doyle says.

Exploring C-corps and SGOs

For businesses organized as C-corporations whose holdings count as qualified small business stock, Doyle also sees an opportunity to exclude up to $10 million of capital gains on a business sale. If those business owners were to gift some stock to their children, he says they would each also enjoy their own $10 million exclusion, further amplifying the opportunity for estate planning.

""Some people don't qualify. But when we're talking to business owners, especially if they're going to do a startup, we mention that they may want to think about organizing your company as a qualified small business to take advantage of this huge exclusion,"" he says.

Philanthropic business owners could also potentially take advantage of the scholarship granting organization credit under the OBBA. According to Giemza, the one-for-one tax credit allows them to contribute the greater of $5,000 or 10% of their adjusted gross income, with a federal cap of $4 billion annually starting in 2027. Contributions could be made in cash or marketable securities, such as appreciated stock, to SGOs that offer scholarships to private or religious K-12 schools.

""Overall, this credit could offer significant tax-saving opportunities and philanthropic flexibility for high-income business owners looking to reduce the value of their estate, support educational causes, and leave a lasting legacy aligned with their values,"" Giemza says.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/leoa_638875138727937513.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:19.178147

Each university received $25,000 “to support innovative research aimed at deepening scientific understanding of yogurt, probiotics, and the gut microbiome.”1

The fellowship program has been active for 13 years and has provided over half a million dollars to support research initiatives. According to the press release, grant winners are picked “solely on their scientific merit and potential contribution to the scientific community, regardless of any benefit to Danone's business.”1 Winners are picked via a panel of experts who consider faculty recommendations, relevance to human health and wellness, and proposal quality. The funding is unrestricted and comes without any oversight or involvement from Danone.

""As interest in gut health continues to grow, it's critical that we support early-stage research that helps uncover how probiotic-rich foods, like certain fermented dairy products, can influence human health,"" said Miguel Freitas, PhD, vice president of nutrition and scientific affairs at Danone North America.1 ""Owen and Ella's projects stood out for their scientific merit and potential impact, and we're excited to see the discoveries their work will bring to light.""

Danone North America first began accepting applicants for their Annual Gut Microbiome, Yogurt and Probiotics Fellowship Grant back in January and wrapped up their acceptance period on March 24, 2025.2

Hale is planning to investigate “eco-evolutionary processes within the microbiome that affect human health, which contributes to identifying the causes and consequences of dysbiosis.”1 His research will focus primarily on Lactobacilli and what long-term effects come from antimicrobial compounds produced by the bacteria. ""I hope my discoveries will inform the development of evolutionarily sustainable treatments or preventative strategies that will protect people from harmful bacteria linked to dysbiosis, inflammation, and infection,"" says Hale.1

Ramamurthy intends to “engineer a probiotic bacterium to import, sense, and produce neurotransmitters to maintain healthy levels in the gut and better understand the interactions between gut and human health and wellness, including reducing depression and anxiety.”1

""This funding underscores the significance of probiotics in maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis in the gut microbiome,"" explains Ramamurthy.1 ""With Danone North America's support, I'm excited to study the gut-brain axis and develop interventions to restore a healthy gut microbiota and improve overall wellness.""

According to reports in Israeli media, including tech news outlet Ctech, the company is burdened with approximately $516 million in debt and has encountered a critical cash flow shortfall following the abrupt withdrawal of shareholder funding.

The move comes after years of heavy investment and limited commercial return. Founded in 2011 by industry pioneer Benny Landa, the company introduced its first alpha and beta digital press models in 2017. However, commercial sales only began in earnest in 2022. To date, just over 50 machines have been sold globally.

Calcalist, an Israeli financial newspaper, reports Landa Digital Printing posted combined losses of $312 million over 2022 and 2023. Revenue reached $35 million in 2022, followed by $47 million in 2023, but losses deepened year-over-year due largely to interest on shareholder loans, many of which were later converted into equity. The company does not have audited financial results for 2024.

At drupa 2024, Landa reportedly secured 50 letters of intent from prospective buyers, prompting the company to order components from suppliers. Ultimately, just 11 of those letters translated into confirmed sales.

A statement issued by the company on June 29, 2025, confirmed the sudden halt in shareholder funding and acknowledged the resulting financial crisis. In response, Landa has implemented a company-wide reorganization, including staff reductions and cost-cutting measures. On June 30, the court granted Landa Digital Printing a 14-day freeze on legal proceedings as it seeks a path forward.

The news has sparked speculation about a potential acquisition by a larger digital print player. While no official discussions have been confirmed, some observers have drawn parallels to HP’s 2002 acquisition of Indigo — another Benny Landa-founded company that helped establish HP as a major force in digital print.

Medtronic demonstrates strong operational efficiency without expanding capital

Capital has improved steadily over recent years

Performance metrics align with broader sector movement on the NYSE Composite

Medtronic, a prominent name in the medical technology sector, is showing promising structural strength in its return metrics. Aligned with broader industry trends reflected in the NYSE Composite, the company’s recent trajectory reveals encouraging operational performance backed by strategic use of existing resources.

Capital Employed A Key Operational Indicator

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) serves as a significant marker for efficiency. It gauges how well a company is generating profit from its operational base. For Medtronic, the trend in ROCE over a multi-year period has indicated a consistent upturn, even as the capital base has remained largely unchanged. This pattern reveals a shift in operational productivity rather than increased spending.

Steady Capital Base Supports Growing Efficiency

One of the key takeaways from Medtronic’s performance is that its capital employed has stayed within a tight range, yet its ability to extract more output from this same base has strengthened. This suggests internal improvements in how the organization is deploying its assets and optimizing its functions across segments. Enhanced efficiencies without an increase in committed capital often indicate disciplined resource allocation.

Efficiency Gains Reflect in Broader Market Context

The company’s performance aligns with the overall behavior, which have seen certain healthcare entities outpace other sectors in operational refinement. As global demand for medical technologies continues, Medtronic's position remains relevant through its focus on productivity improvements.

Reinvestment Through Performance, Not Expansion

Rather than expanding its asset base, Medtronic appears (NYSE:MDT) to be achieving growth through operational reinvestment. This reinvestment is not linked to external funding but to the generation of higher returns through core capabilities. This development enhances the stability of long-term performance metrics.

Distribution Consistency

As part of its shareholder approach, Medtronic has consistently distributed dividends over time, underlining a reliable capital return structure. This aligns with practices common among firms maintaining a stable operating model, where earnings support consistent payout patterns rather than requiring financial restructuring.

Internal Momentum Drives Value Creation

Medtronic’s internal performance indicators reveal that the company is progressing through internal momentum rather than relying on external drivers. While broader financial markets have seen fluctuations, the steadiness of Medtronic's operational improvements helps it maintain relevance among entities tracked by the NYSE Composite.

Continued Watch on Performance Trends

Given the strength in ROCE and the maintained level of capital employed, it becomes essential to monitor how Medtronic navigates its next phases. Its performance to date presents an image of resilience and strategic control in a competitive landscape. The company’s ability to generate more with the same asset base strengthens its operational credibility.",https://kalkinemedia.com/storage/uploads/original/healthinsurance_05_05_2025_00_42_40_277079.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:10:46.866653

Drivers who purchased the auto part from the wholesale retailer are at an increased risk of crashing on the road.

Two types of tires were part of a long list of recalled issued by Costco in recent months.

The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C and the Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires Size 235/40R19 were both recalled.

Michelin issued a recall notice for the Agilis CrossClimate C-metric tires because the size did not comply with regulatory requirements and posed a greater risk of a crash.

""Chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block,"" the recall stated.

The recall also noted that tire identification information is usually written on the side of each tire, directly above the bead.

Drivers who believe they purchased the recalled product were urged to double-check if they possess the faulty tires.

Those who bought the Michelin tires were asked to visit their local Michelin retailer, who would remove and replace the product with an equivalent tire.

Drivers will not be charged for the service.

The other tire, by Bridgestone Blizzak, was recalled because it did not comply with certain safety measures.

According to the recall, the Blizzak 6 tires ""did not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls.""

""The Department of Transportation has found that tires missing the required DOT symbol may be used in appropriate applications, increasing the risk of a crash,"" the recall said.

Drivers were urged to confirm they were affected by the recall by identifying if their tire has four distinct markings.

Any tire that has the brand ""Bridgestone,"" the ""Blizzak 6"" tire line, the ""235/40R19"" tire size, and a ""1VR100W122224/1VR100W122324/1VR100W122424"" identification number should be brought in for an inspection.

The vehicle should be brought to any Bridgestone company-owned retail store or Bridgestone/Firestone authorized dealer.

Employees will inspect and replace all tires that match the description, according to the recall.

Drivers who replaced the tires already could be eligible for a reimbursement for the tires, parts, labor, fees, and taxes by contacting Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations.

Any Costco shopper who isn't sure if their product was recalled should visit the retailer's website and search for their list of product recalls.

The wholesale retailer also provides a list of archived recalls.

Costco has a generous return policy where consumers can make returns without time limits.

There are some exceptions to this rule — tires, batteries, and other products with a short shelf life could have more specific or limited warranties.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/JA_Costco_Tires_OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-07 16:12:55.491264

But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don't cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare.
That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.
Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies, trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.
She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.","Prices are falling for the popular obesity treatments semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound), but steady access to the drugs remains challenging.

The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance -- out of reach for many patients. And even for people with insurance, coverage remains uneven.

""The medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,"" said Matt Maciejewski, PhD, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.

Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there's hope that prices may fall more in the future.

Drugs Are Still in High Demand

Semaglutide and tirzepatide are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.

Tirzepatide brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year's first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly's best sellers.

Novo Nordisk says semaglutide has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.

Insurance Coverage Is Increasing -- for Some

Benefits consultant company Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.

And Novo says 85% of its patients who have coverage in the U.S. pay $25 or less per month.

Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs approved to treat that condition, with semaglutide branded as Ozempic and tirzepatide branded as Mounjaro.

But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don't cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare.

Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Beverly Tchang, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine's Comprehensive Weight Control Center in New York City.

Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.

""Coverage is not the same as access,"" said Tchang, who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.

Coverage Remains Inconsistent

Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.

Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.

One of the nation's largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.

That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.

Courtney Younglove, MD's, office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer's website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.

""Then some of them just cancel their appointment because they don't have coverage,"" the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.

Cheaper Compounded Drugs Are Still Being Sold

Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the FDA halted compounding earlier this year after deciding that the shortage had ended.

That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.

The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.

It's a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies, trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.

Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by U.S. regulators.

Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.

Prices Have Dropped

Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.

Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per-person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.

There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.

Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.

She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.

""I think price wars are going to drive it down,"" she said. ""I think we are in the early stages. I have hope.""",https://assets.medpagetoday.net/media/images/116xxx/116389.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 20:03:33.942170

However, the “Back to Starbucks” strategy could unlock value.
Starbucks' stock trades at a P/E ratio of 22x, below its five-year average of 25x, suggesting it's undervalued relative to its potential.","Starbucks' recent decision to discontinue its Oleato olive-oil infused beverages and streamline its menu marks a pivotal moment for the coffee giant. Under CEO Brian Niccol's “Back to Starbucks” strategy, the company is shedding complexity to cater to health-conscious consumers and operational efficiency—a move that could position it to reclaim its crown as the go-to destination for premium coffee experiences. For investors, this shift presents a compelling opportunity in a stock that has been languishing amid declining sales and rising competition.

The Health-Conscious Turn: Aligning with Consumer Values

The removal of Oleato and seed oils from most menus is a shrewd response to evolving consumer preferences. Health trends have shifted decisively toward transparency and natural ingredients, with many diners avoiding processed seed oils like canola oil due to perceived health risks. Starbucks' pivot to eliminate these ingredients—and its broader menu simplification—aligns with this demand. By focusing on core coffee offerings and eliminating niche items that failed to resonate (like the divisive Oleato), Starbucks is recalibrating to serve customers who prioritize quality, simplicity, and wellness.

This strategy also addresses a critical operational flaw: menu bloat. The 30% reduction in items, including the elimination of surcharges for plant-based milk, reduces customization complexity. Baristas can now focus on crafting drinks efficiently, which directly tackles the four-minute wait-time goal—a metric critical to customer satisfaction.

Operational Efficiency: The Engine of Recovery

The simplification is not merely about catering to trends; it's about profitability. A would likely show a gradual rebound as reduced menu complexity lowers waste and speeds up service. The introduction of Clover Vertica drip coffee brewers and store redesigns—such as reintroducing condiment bars and ceramic mugs—aims to cut labor costs while enhancing the “third place” ambiance that once defined Starbucks.

Crucially, the company is doubling down on its loyalty program, Starbucks Rewards, which now accounts for 60% of transactions. By prioritizing repeat customers and reducing discounted transactions, Starbucks is safeguarding margins even as it navigates rising coffee bean prices (up 23% since early 2024). The shift also positions the brand to compete with discount rivals like Luckin Coffee, which threatens to undercut prices in key markets.

The Financial Crossroads: Undervalued Stock, Strategic Gains Ahead

Starbucks' stock has underperformed in recent years, reflecting its struggles with declining traffic and operational inefficiencies. A underscores this divergence. However, the “Back to Starbucks” strategy could unlock value. Analysts estimate that menu simplification and operational improvements could boost margins by 100-200 basis points over the next two years.

The company's decision to suspend 2025 financial guidance suggests confidence in its turnaround timeline. With $9.1 billion in cash and equivalents as of July 2025, Starbucks has the liquidity to invest in its store upgrades and labor adjustments without diluting shareholders.

Risks and Considerations

The strategy is not without hurdles. Over-simplification could alienate customers seeking variety, and execution risks loom large—especially with Luckin's aggressive entry into the U.S. market. Additionally, the return of ceramic mugs and free refills may test supply chains. Yet, the long-term bet here is on Starbucks' brand equity and the enduring appeal of its core products, like the Pumpkin Spice Latte, which have proven resilience in nostalgia-driven markets.

Investment Thesis: A Bitter Brew or a Sweet Opportunity?

Starbucks' stock trades at a P/E ratio of 22x, below its five-year average of 25x, suggesting it's undervalued relative to its potential. With a dividend yield of 1.5% and a balance sheet that allows for share buybacks once profitability stabilizes, the stock offers both growth and income appeal.

Investors should consider a gradual position-building approach, with a focus on the next 12-18 months. Key catalysts to watch include:

- Quarterly updates on average order times and store-level margins.

- Competitor dynamics, particularly Luckin's U.S. expansion.

- The rollout of Clover Vertica brewers and store redesigns.

In conclusion, Starbucks' pivot to simplicity is both a necessity and a strategic masterstroke. By leaning into health trends and operational discipline, the company is laying the groundwork for a comeback. For investors, this could be the moment to sip on the undervalued stock while the winds of change brew in its favor.",,N,,2025-07-07 18:07:38.155246

… It’s just super fast for that.” Caper Cart is part of technology company Instacart, which is known for its home delivery services.
The carts drive customers to spend more in part because they expose people to more marketing materials while shopping, Caper told the Washington Post.
How it works A customer who wants to use a Caper Cart can get one at the entrance.
Moving around the store, the technology senses when items are put in the cart — customers don’t need to scan a barcode.","Imagine going on your weekly grocery shopping trip, filling the cart, tapping a credit card and rolling out of the store without having to put a single item on a checkout conveyor belt.

For a little over a week, customers at the ShopRite in Bethlehem Township have had the option of using a Caper Cart to expedite their trip to the store. Sam Colalillo, whose family owns and operates the store at 4701 Freemansburg Ave., said more than 1,000 customers used the carts in the opening week and the plan is to soon double the current fleet of 20.

“It’s really been great, especially in this area,” Colalillo said during a ribbon-cutting Monday morning that drew several curious customers. “We have the hospitals nearby, we have all these different local office buildings. People come in for kind of a midweek shop or to get dinner and a couple of items. … It’s just super fast for that.”

Caper Cart is part of technology company Instacart, which is known for its home delivery services. Instacart acquired Caper AI in 2021 for $350 million.

Grace Mazier, an implementation associate for Instacart, said the company has been rolling out the carts nationwide in the last three years, including Kroger Stores in the Midwest and Sprouts in the Las Vegas area.

“This particular location has been doing so well,” Mazier said. “They’re averaging about 140 per day, which is insane and super exciting. I can see them getting more carts right now.”

Colallio said the carts were brought in by Wakefern Food Corp., the cooperative that runs ShopRite stores. The Colallio family also owns and operates ShopRites in Yardley, Bucks County, and Clinton, Greenwich and Flemington, New Jersey. It plans to implement the technology at those locations as well.

As part of a partnership with Instacart, ShopRite pays a per-use charge, Colallio said.

“They’ve always been great partners,” Colallio said. “They’re always rolling out technology, trying to make this better for customers.”

According to The Washington Post, an individual cart can cost a merchant $5,000 to $10,000, though many have reported recouping costs within a year.

The carts drive customers to spend more in part because they expose people to more marketing materials while shopping, Caper told the Washington Post. It might recommend milk, for example, if someone puts cereal in the cart; an average shopper’s checkout total increases 18% when using its product, the firm said.

Caper said its tech isn’t meant to replace jobs but instead to free workers to maintain aisles or offer customer service, the Post reported.

Other supermarket chains in the Lehigh Valley have implemented technological advances over the years, with Giant Food Store’s Marty the Robot being the most visible.

A spokesperson for Giant said the chain has no plans at the moment to implement Caper Cart technology, though “we’re always exploring ways to best serve our customers.”

Redner’s spokesperson Eric White said said the company has looked into Caper Cart and discussed using the technology.

“At this time we have not taken any steps to placing them within our stores and continue to monitor their use and efficacy within the grocery industry,” White said. “We have an active and positive partnership with Instacart and will reach out to them if we decide to use these carts within our store operation.”

On the other hand, Wegmans has started its own pilot program with Caper Cart at a location near Syracuse, New York.

“At this time, we are collecting customer feedback with the goal of determining whether smart cart technology is a fit for the unique shopping assortment offered in our stores and if it meets the shopping needs of our customers,” spokesperson Tracy Van Auker said. “Since we are in the early stages of our limited pilot, we aren’t yet able to share any specifics on next steps.”

Weis Markets did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

How it works

A customer who wants to use a Caper Cart can get one at the entrance. The customer can enter loyalty club information on the screen to access coupons and apply discounts, though that isn’t a requirement.

Moving around the store, the technology senses when items are put in the cart — customers don’t need to scan a barcode. For produce, a scale is built into the bottom of the cart and weighs the item automatically. The cart shown to the media had its own Northampton County weights and measures inspection sticker.

The screen shows a tally of what’s added to the cart, and includes a running total cost. If an item is taken out of the cart, it’s removed from the list.

When the customer is ready to check out, there is a special lane for the Caper Carts for cash-paying customers or a code can be accessed on the cart’s screen to let you leave without touching anything further in the store. Receipts are then delivered via text or email.

Fleets have used this credit, which provides up to $40,000 per vehicle for eligible commercial electric trucks, to offset the high cost of electrification. The bill terminates this credit outright. Section 112003 cuts off a major financial incentive for adopting battery-electric Class 6–8 trucks.

The section states:

IN GENERAL. — No credit shall be determined under this section with respect to any vehicle acquired after December 31, 2025.

(2) EXCEPTION FOR BINDING CONTRACTS. — Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to vehicles placed in service before January 1, 2033, and acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to vehicles acquired after December 31, 2025.

The bill also proposes to eliminate the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (Section 112004), which helps subsidize the cost of EV charging infrastructure.

IN GENERAL. — Section 30C(i) is amended by striking ‘‘December 31, 2032’’ and inserting ‘‘December

31, 2025’’.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

For fleet shops that have been evaluating or installing high-voltage equipment to support EV charging, this removal could shift return-on-investment timelines significantly.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Volvo-VNR-Electric-Charging.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:32.141399

Faced with these headwinds, the company is focusing on cutting costs.
UPS’ rival FedEx FDX is also cutting costs to combat the weak demand scenario.
UPS’ Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of UPS have declined in excess of 24% in a year, underperforming its industry.","It is no secret that United Parcel Service’s UPS bottom line is being hurt by high costs, mainly on the labor front. High labor costs, in addition to softness concerning parcel volumes, are hurting the company’s operations.

Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations. The weak demand scenario due to the economic slowdown has led to a decline in the volume of packages shipped. Faced with these headwinds, the company is focusing on cutting costs. As part of this exercise, UPS is offering buyouts to delivery drivers for the first time in its 117-year history. UPS’ full-time drivers are eligible for this offer.

The company reportedly aims to trim its workforce by 20,000 this year, representing approximately 4% of the global workforce and shut 73 facilities to streamline operations and lower labor costs. Notably, expenses on compensation and benefits increased 2.1% year over year in 2024. The same is expected to decrease 2.6% in 2025 from 2024 levels, as per our model.

Apart from the tariff-induced economic uncertainties, UPS’ decision to reduce business with its largest customer, Amazon AMZN, contributed to the decision to trim the workforce. UPS’ management has reached an agreement in principle with Amazon to lower the latter’s volume by more than 50% by June 2026. According to Carol Tome, UPS’ chief executive officer, Amazon was not its most profitable customer.

UPS’ rival FedEx FDX is also cutting costs to combat the weak demand scenario. FedEx reportedly will lay off more than 480 employees as it reshuffles operations through the Network 2.0 initiative. In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve its long-term profitability. The DRIVE program resulted in $1.8 billion in permanent savings in fiscal 2024. The program resulted in further $2.2 billion cost savings in fiscal 2025.

These cost reduction initiatives include reducing flight frequencies, parking aircraft and cutting staff. For fiscal 2026, management expects to achieve $1 billion of transformation-related savings, which includes DRIVE and Network2.0.

The cumulative scale of these decisions underscores how challenging and economically vulnerable the hydrogen-for-energy sector has become. Over the span of approximately four weeks, projects valued at tens of billions in multiple countries have collapsed or been shelved indefinitely, erasing significant planned hydrogen production capacity. These reversals are not merely isolated incidents. They represent a broader recognition by industry leaders and governments that hydrogen, particularly for transportation and energy export, is confronting fundamental economic and technical barriers that optimism alone cannot overcome.

Here’s a structured summary table with estimated hydrogen production values (annual tons), based on typical scale for projects of similar size and stated goals from public plans:

Total estimated annual H₂ production capacity canceled: ~1 million tons/year

Australia’s high-profile CQ-H2 green hydrogen export project at Gladstone became the most notable casualty at the start of July. Originally slated as a AUD$12.5 billion (US$8.13 billion) venture aimed at providing substantial hydrogen exports to Japan and South Korea, the project quickly unraveled when Stanwell Corporation withdrew support, citing ballooning costs and questionable market viability. Gladstone was positioned to become Australia’s hydrogen export flagship, but now serves as a stark symbol of hydrogen’s broader economic uncertainties. The cancellation eliminated planned annual hydrogen production of several hundred thousand tons, dealing a severe blow to Queensland’s ambitions to become a renewable energy export powerhouse.

It’s in this context that other Australian news is of interest. Fortescue recently pulled back from hydrogen with significant retrenchment and leadership changes in its hydrogen group. In May, roughly 90 positions in hydrogen-related roles across Perth and Gladstone were eliminated as the company refocused away from large-scale manufacturing toward research and development aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs. Mark Hutchinson, CEO of Fortescue Hydrogen Systems, retired ahead of his 65th birthday after less than two years in the position, transitioning to a senior adviser role with marketing responsibilities. Cameron Smith, who previously led the hydrogen systems division, also departed amid these cuts. CEO Dino Otranto has now absorbed operational responsibility for hydrogen and electrification, while Agustin “Gus” Pichot, formerly head of global growth, took on the role of CEO Growth and Energy effective July 1. These changes reflect a significant recalibration, abandoning the earlier ambitious target of producing 15 million tons of hydrogen per year by 2030, in favor of a more cautious, research-driven approach amid weaker-than-expected market conditions.

Germany faced similarly harsh realities. ArcelorMittal, one of Europe’s largest steel producers, abandoned plans to convert its Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt plants to hydrogen-based direct reduced iron and electric arc furnaces. Each of these green steel plants was to cost roughly €1.3 billion (US$1.52 billion), with projected hydrogen consumption amounting to hundreds of thousands of tons annually. ArcelorMittal cited soaring energy costs and insufficient economic incentives as key reasons for pulling the plug.

This abandonment was part of what prompted my recent assessment of different new steel approaches, which found that hydrogen-based iron and steelmaking remains fundamentally disadvantaged compared to emerging alternatives. With hydrogen typically priced around $5 to $8 per kilogram, even optimistic scenarios of $3 to $4 per kilogram still render it uneconomical for steel production at scale. Direct reduction processes relying on hydrogen incur substantial energy losses through electrolysis, storage, compression, and handling, inevitably inflating steel production costs beyond competitive thresholds. Molten oxide electrolysis, on the other hand, becomes viable with electricity at $0.03 to $0.05 per kWh, delivering steel at costs approaching $170 to $250 per ton assuming it reaches full commercialization.

Similarly, biomethane-based direct reduction combined with carbon capture can be economically attractive where biomass is abundant and sequestration sites are nearby. Flash ironmaking paired with natural gas and carbon capture achieves steel costs comfortably below $200 per ton. Hydrogen is thus hampered not by technological maturity, but by structural economic limitations that alternative processes inherently avoid. For steel decarbonization strategies, it’s clear the future belongs to methods that offer fundamentally superior cost structures and energy efficiencies.

Germany’s struggles did not end there. E.ON, a major utility, canceled its planned 20-megawatt green hydrogen facility in Essen and also withdrew from the regional H₂ Ruhr pipeline initiative. These actions further reduced Europe’s planned hydrogen capacity and infrastructure, again driven by unmanageable economic realities.

In India, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) abruptly terminated its ₹2 billion (US$23.3 million) green hydrogen hub tender in early July. The project’s cancellation included the refunding of all tender fees, highlighting how rapidly India has reversed course amid growing doubts about hydrogen’s economic competitiveness. While India’s government had previously heralded hydrogen as a key component of its decarbonization strategy, economic pragmatism now appears to have overshadowed earlier enthusiasm.

Spain’s once-promising Repsol and Hydric Power joint venture at Puertollano similarly collapsed. The green hydrogen project, valued at more than €100 million (US$117 million), faced immediate shelving in July due to both technical and economic infeasibility. Spain had touted Puertollano as a cornerstone of its green hydrogen ambitions, yet the project’s failure signals severe underlying structural problems in hydrogen deployment even within supportive policy environments.

The United Kingdom also saw major hydrogen initiatives retreat. Air Products scrapped its £2 billion (US$2.72 billion) green hydrogen import terminal project in Immingham on the Humber Estuary. The facility, initially seen as critical for the UK’s hydrogen supply and industrial decarbonization plans, fell victim to policy uncertainty and inadequate governmental financial backing. This cancellation underscores the risks inherent in hydrogen infrastructure investments that rely heavily on continuous policy and subsidy support.

In the United States, the picture was equally bleak. BP indefinitely paused its blue hydrogen and carbon capture project at its refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Once considered a potential multi-billion-dollar flagship for blue hydrogen in America’s Midwest, the project stalled amid rising skepticism over carbon capture’s viability and shifting political priorities. Cleveland-Cliffs canceled its $500 million hydrogen-based steel facility planned for Middletown, Ohio, depriving the industry of another major hydrogen consumer. ExxonMobil’s $330 million clean hydrogen initiative at its Baytown, Texas refinery was also halted after federal funding evaporated under new political realities, leaving substantial planned hydrogen production capacity stranded.

Taken collectively, these project cancellations represent billions of dollars in lost investment and a million tons of planned hydrogen production capacity that will not materialize. The ripple effect on hydrogen-based transportation and infrastructure projects is significant. Without reliable, economically viable hydrogen supplies, many downstream initiatives from heavy trucks and marine vessels to industrial heat and green steelmaking face substantially increased operational risks and reduced credibility. The cancellations of June and July reinforce what has become increasingly clear throughout 2025: hydrogen’s economic model, particularly for transportation and export, remains fragile and heavily dependent on external subsidies, stable policy frameworks, and optimistic assumptions about market uptake.

It’s in context of these billions in evaporating hydrogen plays that I updated my hydrogen deathwatch list today, finding more firms that had given up the ghost, either through complete fiscal meltdown or by quietly pivoting away from hydrogen. Over 20% of the firms on my list, 33 of 162, have either gone into receivership or pivoted to something useful.

These widespread reversals should serve as a critical wake-up call for policymakers and industrial strategists still vainly hoping to leverage hydrogen as a central pillar of energy transition efforts. Electrification and battery storage solutions, by contrast, continue gaining momentum, attracting investment and achieving reliable cost reductions year over year. Hydrogen proponents must grapple realistically with the fundamental economics at play.

Remember, this is only four weeks worth of failures. They’ve been ongoing since the beginning of 2025, with Michael Liebreich putting up #HydrogenSouffle LinkedIn posts almost daily. BNEF just reported on its database of hydrogen contracts and still only 13% of the 299 hydrogen contacts in their database have firm off takers. This is a radically small number of contracts and a homeopathic number of firm agreements given the massive ambitions for 2030, as well as the massive announcements of the past few years.

This disastrous month underscores that promises alone cannot sustain a hydrogen economy. Realism, pragmatism, and a clear-eyed approach to economically sustainable energy solutions must now prevail if meaningful progress is to be made. That means hydrogen will be reserved for what it is absolutely required for, almost entirely industrial feedstocks, and nothing else.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-7-2025-06_44_11-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:11:39.090437
ID24,Levi Strauss,2025-07-07 19:14:34+00:00,Retail Dive,The retail inventory method vs. cost accounting in the tariff era,Daphne Howland,,,,,https://www.retaildive.com/news/rim-retail-inventory-method-vs-cost-accounting-under-tariffs-Walmart/751824/,"Cost accounting is also more accurate because it leverages the actual cost of inventory, according to Mike Sansone, partner in Kearney’s consumer practice.
“With tariffs, RIM will, basically, rapidly revalue your inventory, much more quickly than cost accounting.
Under RIM accounting, cost spikes are reflected in the retail-to-cost ratio but not at the item level, leading to broader adjustments in markups, he said.
“All methods will experience the impact of tariffs, but cost accounting will more precisely reflect the effect at the item level compared to the retail method,” he said.
Major chains still using the retail inventory method include Walmart, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney and Dollar Tree.","To determine the value of ending inventory and, ultimately, margins, many retailers have stuck with an accounting practice known as the retail inventory method — in some cases for more than 100 years — despite a slew of downsides.

Now there’s another reason to switch from RIM to a cost-based accounting method: see-sawing tariffs under current U.S. trade policy.

It’s not just that RIM is outdated, although cost-based accounting is better equipped to take full advantage of digital tools, experts say. Cost accounting is also more accurate because it leverages the actual cost of inventory, according to Mike Sansone, partner in Kearney’s consumer practice.

“With tariffs, RIM will, basically, rapidly revalue your inventory, much more quickly than cost accounting. But I didn't suddenly bring in more product, right?” he said by video conference. “It's a revaluation of the inventory that is not really grounded in reality.”

The ups and downs of tariffs

RIM uses a cost complement — a ratio of the cost of goods available divided by the retail price of goods available. A century ago this was a brilliant formula for pencil-and-paper estimates of inventory and margins, as merchandise flowed in and out of stores.

Visibility into those line items fogs up easily, though, because the method works best when markons, markups and markdowns are fairly consistent, according to Suni Shamapande, partner at PwC U.S. Under RIM accounting, cost spikes are reflected in the retail-to-cost ratio but not at the item level, leading to broader adjustments in markups, he said.

Enter today’s U.S. tariff policy, where consistency is out the window. Using RIM, all inventory — including older inventory unaffected by tariffs — is subject to the ratio. Margins fluctuate wildly as tariffs move up, up again, or down.

Cost accounting — the alternative that Macy’s and Nordstrom recently embraced for reasons unrelated to tariffs — instead uses the actual cost of goods at the item level. This provides tariffs’ impact on margins, cost of goods sold and inventory valuation only for the stock hit by the import duties.

There can still be some aberration under cost accounting because different approaches — variations like FIFO (first in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out) or weighted average — can yield different results when there’s a change in input costs like tariffs, according to Shamapande. But not as much as with RIM.

“All methods will experience the impact of tariffs, but cost accounting will more precisely reflect the effect at the item level compared to the retail method,” he said.

The repercussions

The consequences are playing out at retailers in different ways and to varying degrees. Major chains still using the retail inventory method include Walmart, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney and Dollar Tree.

At Walmart, the method is making it difficult to assess how tariffs are impacting performance, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told analysts in May. The company pulled its near-term guidance as a result.

Rainey described how, under the ratio used in RIM, rising prices drive markups on inventory and merchandise margin gains, while markdowns offset that. Walmart U.S. has always employed RIM — “it's not new for us, and it's a common method of accounting in the retail industry” — but the up-and-down tariffs are injecting volatility into the exercise, he said.

“The magnitude of these swings, both positive and negative, given the level of additional costs that could be applied to the inventory that we're purchasing right now, are unprecedented in our business and could result in swings in margin and earnings by quarter,” Rainey said.

Walmart has been vocal on the issue, but this is likely also affecting other retailers, analysts say.

“Walmart's disclosure that its inventory accounting might cause a 2Q gross margin benefit has stirred some questions,” Bank of America analysts led by Lorraine Hutchinson said in a May research note. “A key reason that [Walmart] called this out is that it has started raising prices, but not all products in inventory carry tariffs yet.”

Because gross margins factor into buyers’ evaluations and compensation, RIM often plays a part in buying behavior at apparel retailers and department stores. A sudden revaluation due to tariffs can throw a wrench into inventory planning, according to Kearney’s Sansone.

Mostly, though, the RIM-induced effect seen at Walmart will be less pronounced at any retailer less willing or able to quickly adjust prices, according to Bank of America analysts.

“Apparel and footwear retailers have much less dynamic pricing and typically can't change prices quickly (most clothing is ticketed at the factory well in advance of hitting the shelves),” Hutchinson said. “We might see more dynamic pricing in off-price, which has a more advanced distribution network and may have started changing tickets already.

Some industry leaders see these efforts as key to solving the industry’s much talked about recruitment and talent issues.

One novelty at the Sydney event this year is an interactive Q&A session where delegates can ask a panel pressing questions about their own personal careers. Julie Morgan (pictured) is one of the panellists for “Off the record: Career advice from insurance trailblazers.” Morgan is head of claims in Australia for the global insurer AXA XL.

However, Morgan said, during her career, she has found two things that stand out and really help. “First, seeking out the right role models and mentors, which are different and change at each stage of your career, with a focus on always building renewing your supporter and sponsor network during your progression,” she said.

Secondly, Morgan suggested that insurance professionals actively risk manage their own careers and ask questions that will help them improve their prospects. “Seek feedback that is going to inform how confident and impressive your current performance is so that you do actively make corrections in how you engage with those influencing your career,” she said.

The AXA XL leader said the industry is always looking for driven, passionate people “who get the job done. You will be very happily surprised by the support and guidance that gets retuned to you by leadership and experienced professionals if you are eager to learn and develop on what will progress your career and meet the needs of the business,” she said.

Big insurers and mentorships

Mentorships of some kind are in place at many of the country’s insurance firms. The big insurers, including Suncorp Group, Insurance Australia Group (IAG) and QBE all have well established programs.

“Mentorship programs are one of many levers that a business can use to help lift our female talent,” said Sydney-based Claudio Saita, the firm’s head of Australia and Pacific, at the time of the launch.

One of Morgan’s co-panellists, Ricarda Simon, is also a very strong supporter of mentorships. Simon is a senior partner with global insurance recruitment firm, Eliot Partnership. Her work includes talent advisory projects. “One of the most effective steps the insurance industry and its stakeholders can take to address the growing skills gap is to invest in structured, cross-generational talent development that combines mentorship with modern capability building,” said Simon in a recent IB interview.

Dollar Tree has completed the previously revealed sale of its Family Dollar business segment to Brigade Capital Management LP and Macellum Capital Management LLC for $1 billion. Net proceeds from the sale are estimated to total approximately $800 million, comprising $665 million paid at closing and approximately $135 million as a result of the monetization of cash prior to closing through a reduction of net working capital.

Prominent retail executive Duncan MacNaughton was appointed chairman and CEO of Family Dollar back in May. MacNaughton is no stranger to the Family Dollar business, having previously been its president and COO. With more than 30 years of experience guiding large-scale businesses through growth and transformation, his resume also includes stints at Kraft Food, H-E-B, Albertsons, Supervalu and particularly Walmart, where he was EVP, chief merchandising and marketing officer.

Jason Nordin will remain as president of Family Dollar.

Under the dedicated leadership team and new private equity owners, Brigade and Macellum, along with Arkhouse Management Co., Family Dollar is focused on building a stronger, more agile organization.

Family Dollar’s headquarters will remain in Chesapeake, Va., and it will continue its mission to “serve the underserved,” focused on the opportunity to build a “new Family Dollar.”

The discount retailer was founded in 1959 in Charlotte, N.C., with the goal of offering high-quality merchandise at affordable prices. Today, Family Dollar has more than 7,500 locations nationwide.

“This is a defining moment for Family Dollar — a chance to return to our roots, refocus on our unique strengths and build a future tailored to the communities we proudly serve,"" said MacNaughton. ""We're energized by the opportunity to stand on our own and reimagine what value means for families across America.”

According to the company, the new ownership structure provides Family Dollar with the strategic support and financial resources needed to unlock its full potential. Brigade, Macellum and Arkhouse reportedly bring deep expertise in retail and a shared vision for Family Dollar’s growth.",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2025-07/family_dollar_2600302963_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:11:23.488061

Costco customers are being urged to inspect recent purchases after the retailer issued multiple product recalls spanning a range of household and personal items over significant safety hazards. The recall affects purchases made both in-store and through the retailer’s direct-from-manufacturer program, Costco Next.

Among the most urgent warnings are recalls for two U-shaped window air conditioners: one from Danby, sold between June 2021 and February 2022, and another from Midea, sold from June 2021 through May 2025.

According to safety notices, these units may retain water that doesn’t drain quickly enough, potentially creating a breeding ground for mold. Mold exposure may pose health risks, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions. Costco has asked owners of these units to stop using immediately and has offered free repair kits or refunds.

Portable charging devices have also been recalled. Two Anker power banks, models A1257 and A1263, have been recalled for safety risks related to overheating. Overheating may cause plastic components to melt, smoke, or catch fire.

Customers are instructed to stop using the devices and contact Anker for a replacement or refund, provided they submit photos of the unit and its serial number marked as “recalled.”

Anker's recall reminds customers that recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries, because they present a greater risk of fire. It’s recommended to check your municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center for proper disposal.

Tire safety concerns have also emerged for specific Bridgestone and Michelin tires sold at Costco.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 tires in size 235/40R19 were recalled because they lack the required Department of Transportation (DOT) certification marking on their sidewalls. While they meet performance standards, their use without proper labeling violates federal regulations.

Also recalled are the Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires in size 185/60R15C, which may experience tread separation, which could increase the risk of an accident.

Other items now under recall include:

BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells, which have had reports of weight plates detaching during use.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer, following reports that its lid may open while under pressure, risking burns.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler, which can pinch or crush fingers when the handle is in use.

Segway Ninebot Kickscooter and Sublue Underwater Scooter, both recalled over mechanical and electrical hazards.

Topo Chico Mineral Water (18-pack) sold in certain Texas and Louisiana stores, recalled for potential contamination with pseudomonas, a bacteria that may affect immunocompromised individuals.

A selection of Fresh and Ready Foods sandwiches and salads sold in business centers across four Western states due to possible Listeria contamination.

Certain Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu medications, which were pulled January 2025 for potential foreign material contamination.

Costco Gave Directions For Customers To Receive Repairs Or Refunds Following The Recalls

Customers who purchased a Danby brand U-shaped window air conditioner between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022, Midea brand U-shaped window air conditioner between June 2021 and May 2025 should stop using the units “immediately. Per Costco, they “present a risk of mold growth” from pooled water in the AC units.

Costco members who purchased Anker power banks should discontinue use due to a potential issue with the lithium-ion batteries. They can submit to receive a replacement power bank.

Costco also issued recalls for Bridgestone Blizzak 6 tires and Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires. The Bridgestone tires, “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 139.” The Michelin tires are being recalled because “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.”

BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells are also being recalled by Costco “for posing an impact hazard” if plates dislodge during use.

According to Costco, the membership-only warehouse club strives to ensure its members receive the absolute best.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of +7% to +11% for FY2026.

Immediate unlocking of value

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

Intelligent Operations – Agentic AI creates a paradigm shift that opens a strategic opportunity

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labour-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Combining the capabilities and scale required to lead in Intelligent Operations

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai[7] to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Value creation

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin6 in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

Smooth integration

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain information in this announcement, as well as oral statements made regarding the Transaction, and other information published by WNS, Capgemini or any member of the Capgemini Group contain statements which are, or may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements”, including, but not limited to, the acceleration of Capgemini and WNS’ growth and the value-additive nature of the Transaction for Capgemini shareholders. The words “anticipates”, “expects”, “believes”, “intends, “estimates”, “plans”, “projects”, “may”, “would”, “will”, “should”, “continue”, or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and on numerous assumptions regarding the business strategies and the environment in which Capgemini, any member of the Capgemini Group, including WNS and its subsidiaries following the Transaction (“Post-Transaction Group”) shall operate in the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements. The forward looking statements contained in this announcement relate to Capgemini, any member of the Capgemini Group or the Post-Transaction Group’s future prospects, developments and business strategies, the expected timing and scope of the Transaction and other statements other than historical facts. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, please refer, without limitations, to the risks identified in Capgemini’s most recent Universal Registration Document (Document d’Enregistrement Universel) available on Capgemini’s website (https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/). Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to, the following risks relating to the Transaction, including in respect of the satisfaction of closing conditions to the Transaction on a timely basis or at all, including the ability to obtain required regulatory approvals and the required scheme shareholder approval; unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to the Transaction and any related financing; uncertainties as to the timing of the Transaction; litigation relating to, or other challenges to, the Transaction; the impact of the Transaction on each company’s business operations (including the threatened or actual loss of employees, clients or suppliers); the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining cost savings and synergies from the Transaction; incurrence of unexpected costs and expenses in connection with the Transaction; risks related to changes in the financial, equity and debt markets; and risks related to political, economic and market conditions. In addition, the risks to which WNS’ business is subject, including those risks described in WNS’ periodic reports filed with the SEC, could adversely affect the Transaction and, following the completion of the Transaction, the Company’s operations and future prospects. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Capgemini and WNS to predict or assess the impact of every factor that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Specifically, statements of estimated cost savings and synergies relate to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature involve, risks, uncertainties and contingencies. As a result, the cost savings and synergies referred to may not be achieved, may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated. Due to the scale of the Post-Transaction Group, there may be additional changes to the Post-Transaction Group’s operations. As a result, and given the fact that the changes relate to the future, the resulting cost synergies may be materially greater or less than those estimated.

Forward-looking statements contained herein are only based upon currently available information and speak only as of the date of this announcement, and Capgemini expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Capgemini’s expectations with regard thereto or change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.

Dive Brief:

Food giant Kraft Heinz is recalling more than 360,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon products for possible listeria contamination.

Affected products include fully cooked turkey bacon produced from April 24 through June 11, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Products were shipped across the U.S., with some exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses have been reported, FSIS said. The possible contamination was discovered through Kraft Heinz's internal laboratory testing.

Dive Insight:

Major food companies have grappled with high-profile listeria recalls. Last September, Boar's Head closed a facility months after an outbreak led to nine deaths and more than 7 million pounds of recalled meat.

Deli meats and ready-to-eat products are among the foods most susceptible to listeria contamination, since pathogens aren't destroyed in the refrigeration process. There were 65 recalls over potential listeria contamination in 2024, compared to 47 the prior year, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

Following large-scale outbreaks last year, the USDA released a plan to ramp up listeria inspections at meat plants. However, a scientific advisory committee tasked with overseeing the regulatory strategy was terminated in March as part of the Trump administration's effort to slash costs and streamline the government.

Consuming food contaminated with listeria can lead to Listeriosis, which can be especially harmful for pregnant women, newborns and those over the age of 65. Symptoms can appear sometimes weeks after eating contaminated food, according to the FSIS.

The Kraft Heinz recall includes Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original products across a variety of package sizes. Affected products include ""use by"" dates ranging from as early as July 18 to as late as Sept. 4.

WNS brings deep industry experience and a strong digital BPS business into the mix.
Capgemini’s goal is clear: build a consulting-led, AI-native services business that can deliver outcomes across the entire value chain.
If successful, Capgemini will walk away with more than just a stronger BPS portfolio, it will have a clearer, more scalable path to lead in the age of AI-powered intelligent operations.","Capgemini is making a calculated move to reshape its business services portfolio with the $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS. It’s not just about scale, it’s about readiness for a new model of delivery. As AI adoption moves past experimentation, enterprises are under pressure to operationalize it in meaningful, measurable ways. That’s where Intelligent Operations comes in, and that’s exactly where Capgemini is aiming to lead.

WNS brings deep industry experience and a strong digital BPS business into the mix. With capabilities spanning analytics, automation, and AI-powered service delivery across sectors like banking, insurance, travel, and healthcare, WNS gives Capgemini a ready-made platform to serve clients looking to go beyond traditional outsourcing. This isn’t about cutting costs at the margins. It’s about using Agentic AI and GenAI to redesign how processes run, decisions get made, and value is created.

Capgemini’s goal is clear: build a consulting-led, AI-native services business that can deliver outcomes across the entire value chain. By integrating WNS, it strengthens its BPS revenue base (a combined €1.9 billion in 2024), opens up cross-selling opportunities across complementary client bases, and extends its presence in North America, still the largest market for managed and digital services.

Agentic AI is central to the pitch. Unlike basic automation or rule-based workflows, Agentic AI enables systems to act autonomously, adapt over time, and deliver insights with context. That’s a different level of capability, and one that demands new approaches to operations. This acquisition positions Capgemini to meet that demand head-on, with the vertical depth, tech stack, and service delivery capacity to back it up.

From a financial perspective, the deal is expected to be EPS accretive starting in 2026, with additional value unlocked through revenue and cost synergies by 2027. But beyond the numbers, this move signals a strategic pivot. Capgemini isn’t just responding to where the services market is heading, it’s trying to shape it. And in an environment where AI adoption is moving fast and client expectations are evolving even faster, that’s exactly what it needs to do.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. If successful, Capgemini will walk away with more than just a stronger BPS portfolio, it will have a clearer, more scalable path to lead in the age of AI-powered intelligent operations.",https://files.cyberriskalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/capgemini-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:12:00.953228

Under new leadership, both companies have placed a renewed focus on digital operations.

Kroger: Moving full steam ahead on omnichannel strategies to enhance both its operations and customer experiences, Kroger launched a new e-commerce business unit aimed at centralizing operations. Yael Cosset, SVP and CIO at Kroger, is heading up the e-commerce unit.

Sargent said that the move and Cosset’s appointment will propel growth in Kroger’s e-commerce operations, which took in $13 billion sales during the most recent fiscal year. “Accelerating Kroger’s e-commerce growth is a top priority,” added Sargent. “As the architect of Kroger’s digital strategy, Yael will continue to make it easier for customers to shop for our fresh, affordable food.”

“The interim CEO, Ron Sargent, has not been timid about moving forward strategically,” noted Carol Levenso, director of research at independent bond research firm Gimme Credit. “He has consolidated the companyʼs e-commerce operations, announced the closing over the next 18 months of 60 unprofitable stores and has begun a comprehensive review of the e-commerce business and noncore assets.”

On the retail media side of things, Kroger Precision Marketing (KPM) brought incremental sales reporting to self-service programmatic campaigns. Incremental sales measurement is now available for qualified campaigns placed through The Trade Desk. The new capability isolates the impact of media spend by comparing exposed audiences with a control group that mirrors the advertising audience. Progressive Grocer was able to find out more from Brian Spencer, KPM’s marketing director, this past February.

Albertsons: Meanwhile, during Albertson' Q3 earnings in January, then-CEO Vivek Sankaran observed that retail media is one of the grocer’s biggest opportunities for business reinvestment. Since then, the company’s retail media arm has revealed several advancements.

The Albertsons Media Collective launched an API that will enable advertisers to integrate Albertsons campaign performance data into their own measurement models for analysis. Complementing these efforts, Albertsons Media Collective is partnering with TransUnion to offer its advertisers TruAudience marketing mix modeling measurement to unlock ease and efficiency in comparing performance across retailers and channels.

In March, the Albertsons Media Collective extended its partnership with omnichannel advertising management platform ADvendio. The retail media arm for Albertsons first adopted the platform last year to simplify its advertising workflows, improve integration between sales and ad order management, and automate important processes.

Albertsons Media Collective also recently launched an in-store digital display network pilot through a partnership with STRATACACHE Inc. In addition to creating a more engaging shopping experience for customers, the program will help provide insights through advanced measurement capabilities for brand partners, allowing for proof of play, direct sales attribution and sales lift.

[RELATED: Albertsons Focuses on 4 Digital Platforms for Growth]

In addition, shortly following its failed merger with Kroger, Albertsons began reorganizing its regional structure. The grocer is combining its Intermountain and Denver divisions, and also reorganizing itself into three regions: East, West and California.

The region that now encompasses most of Idaho, Montana and much of Wyoming, as well as Colorado, will be known as the Mountain West Division.

An Albertsons representative confirmed the divisional consolidation to Progressive Grocer, sharing that the changes will help the company “operate in new and innovative ways as we serve our customers and communities.”

Private Label

Store brands continue to provide strength and growth opportunities for grocers. This is an area where both Kroger and Albertsons have invested their dollars.

Kroger: In Kroger’s first quarter of fiscal 2025, private label outperformed national brands for the seventh straight quarter. In March, the company’s assortment of products sold under its Our Brands umbrella added five new items: Salad Kits, Kettle Style Tortilla Chips, Restaurant Style Italian Dressing, Organic Instant Mushroom Tea, and Muffins. The retailer is on track to launch more than 900 new items in 2025.

Albertsons: For its part, Albertsons launched its latest Own Brand, Chef’s Counter. The new private label is first debuting with a selection of ready-to-cook marinated meats. Albertsons plans to expand its Chef’s Counter line next year by introducing premium selections in the deli and frozen sections, along with globally inspired products in the center store. To celebrate the launch, Albertsons partnered with renowned chef and TV personality Antonia Lofaso as the brand’s first ambassador.

Cincinnati-based Kroger employs nearly 410,000 associates who serve more than 11 million customers daily through an e-commerce and store experience under a variety of banner names. The grocer is No. 4 on The PG 100, Progressive Grocer’s 2025 list of the top food and consumables retailers in North America.

As of Feb. 22, Albertsons Cos. operated 2,270 retail food and drug stores with 1,728 pharmacies, 405 associated fuel centers, 22 dedicated distribution centers and 19 manufacturing facilities. The Boise, Idaho-based company operates stores across 34 states and the District of Columbia under more than 20 well-known banners.

The collaboration combines advanced steelmaking technologies with next-generation electrocoat solutions. The results were presented at the recent SURCAR automotive painting conference in Cannes.

The study revealed that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the steel material required to build a vehicle can be reduced by up to 30% by using ArcelorMittal’s electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking process, along with lightweighting strategies such as its ArcelorMittal Multi Part Integration (MPI) solution and the application of its third-generation advanced high-strength steels (AHSS). These innovations not only lower emissions but also enhance structural performance and design flexibility.

During the paint shop phase, PPG’s advanced electrocoat technologies provide superior corrosion protection while also minimizing environmental impact. These technologies help reduce emissions from component use by 20% and cut GHG emissions by 10%. This aligns with increasingly stringent environmental and health regulations.

The companies also highlighted the success of the PPG Zircobond thin-film pretreatment technology. PPG Zircobond technology is a benchmark for sustainable surface treatment in the automotive industry.

“This case study is more than a technical achievement, it’s a blueprint for how collaboration across the value chain can deliver real climate impact,” said Thierry Destruhaut, PPG customer sustainability business partner, Automotive OEM Coatings.

ArcelorMittal’s MPI solution helps carmakers build vehicles more efficiently. It uses strong steel and special laser-welding technology to combine multiple parts into one, reducing the number of components and simplifying assembly. MPI works with all types of powertrains and is especially useful for making battery packs, chassis and body structures in electric and small vehicles. This smart design approach cuts production time, saves materials, lowers CO2 emissions and helps manufacturers meet their environmental goals.

“We already offer solutions that can deliver significant CO2 reductions today,” said Elena Uta, product development manager for breakthrough products automotive, ArcelorMittal Global R&D. “That’s why close collaboration across the value chain is essential. Our advanced steel solutions, including third-generation AHSS and our MPI concept, help OEMs lower emissions while optimizing vehicle performance.”

The presentation also explored future areas of innovation for the ArcelorMittal-PPG partnership. These include the development of bio-based materials, next-generation curing technologies and process improvements in areas such as ovens, air intake and filtration. Additionally, the companies are investigating emerging steel grades that offer higher strength and even greater lightweighting potential.",https://s19525.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ppg-steel.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 15:07:03.656024

Rates of decline in both new orders and output accelerated in June 2025, leading to the sharpest cutback in purchasing for almost a year, S&P Global said in its latest monthly survey of around 400 companies.

The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 48.8 in June from 49.5 in May, remaining below the 50.0 neutral threshold for the fourth consecutive month. A score below 50 indicates economic contraction.

“A faster drop in input purchases combined with stalling hiring activity suggests that firms expect demand to remain low and are thereby looking to make cost savings,” said David Owen, senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

He said that the “downbeat” sentiment reflects subdued hopes for order books and concerns that geopolitical risks could cause greater economic disruption.

Originally published on U.S. Bank company blog

MINNEAPOLIS - U.S. Bank released its third Small Business Perspective survey report, revealing how owners across the country are responding to an environment defined by rapid change. The nationwide survey of 1,000 small business owners explored how they are navigating challenges ranging from economic stressors to the rise of generative AI, all while remaining focused on long-term growth, succession planning, and leaving a lasting legacy.

""This year's survey makes it clear that small business owners are committed to future-proofing their businesses in response to today's economic climate and rapid technological change,"" said Shruti Patel, U.S. Bank's Chief Product Officer for Business Banking. ""From embracing generative AI to responding to shifting economic conditions like tariffs and thinking proactively about succession, owners are serious about the future of their businesses. There is a real opportunity - and responsibility - for financial institutions to show up as strategic partners in helping small businesses navigate what's next.""

Handing the Reins to the Next Generation

With more than half of U.S. small business owners now over age 55, succession planning is becoming increasingly urgent. While many owners are not yet ready to step away - with only 54% having created a succession plan - new generations are preparing to take their place: more than one-third (36%) of Gen Z and Millennial owners say they plan to acquire a business from a retiring owner.

The report reveals a striking gap between intention and action. While 85% of surveyed participants say they originally became an owner to create something they could pass on, and 84% wanted to create generational wealth for their family, only 54% have a formal succession plan in place.

A growing number of owners (62%) have seen their retirement timelines accelerate in the past five years. But for many, navigating succession is a challenge:

* 62% find the process overwhelming

* 56% worry they won't get a reasonable price for their business when it's time to sell

* 53% lack the proper resources or guidance to plan for the future of their business

Owners with strong business performance were more likely to have a succession plan in place: 64% of those with a plan reported significant growth over the past year, compared to 50% of those without a plan.

Nearly 4 in 10 small business owners (37%) say they plan to sell their business in the next 12 months, suggesting how quickly transitions of ownership may be approaching for some businesses. However, retiring business owners are not the only ones looking to sell, with a higher number of Gen Z and Millennial owners (41%) than Boomers and Gen X (33%) saying they plan to sell their business.

While the small business landscape has changed dramatically over the years, the motivations that originally inspired owners still drive them today. Most remain deeply committed to their work: 86% want to continue running their business as long as possible, and 87% are hopeful they'll leave behind a positive legacy when they eventually step away.

Economic Pressures are Influencing How Owners Operate

The need for small business owners to make long-term plans is reinforced by the day-to-day worries they are facing. Respondents reported their top macroeconomic stressors as:

* The economic environment (98%)

* Inflation or increased costs of materials / supplies (92%)

* Competition (92%)

* The ability of consumers to maintain their spending (86%)

* Fraud or cybersecurity threats (85%)

* Obtaining enough funding to support my business (84%)

Among other stressors small business owners cited, 4 out of 5 (81%) owners felt at least somewhat stressed about tariffs.

Despite these stressors, 96% of owners reported their business as currently successful and 88% saw growth in the past year. To manage pressures and position their businesses for the future, many owners are prioritizing key steps in the year ahead, including focusing on revenue (48%), ensuring enough staff (33%), improving company efficiency and cost-effectiveness (32%), and reacting to the general economic landscape such as inflation and recession risk (29%).

To get a pulse check on the most current sentiment, U.S. Bank conducted a follow-up survey of 500 small business leaders during the month of May. While stress levels on the economic environment were similarly high, two-thirds (66%) said the country's economy is moving in the right direction, with only 18% saying it's going in the wrong direction. This sentiment was even stronger among younger business leaders (Gen Z and Millennial), with 74% saying it was moving in the right direction, vs. 52% of leaders from older generations (Gen X and Boomer).

Despite this optimism, a majority (58%) of the leaders expressed at least some concern that tariffs may impact their business operations, and 57% expect their input costs to go up as a result of tariffs with most expecting a cost increase between 1-10%. At the same time, leaders were slightly more likely to anticipate a positive rather than negative impact from tariffs across several business factors - including cost of goods, customer demand, margin profitability, capital investments, and labor/HR - but these expectations were generally modest, with most leaders expressing a neutral or only slightly positive outlook on the potential effects of tariffs.

Small Business Owners are Turning to Gen AI and Digital Tools to Stay Competitive

As small business owners look to create long-term success for their businesses, they are embracing generative AI (Gen AI) and digital tools. Nearly 6 in 10 (57%) are currently using or plan to implement Gen AI solutions in the next year. Among those using it, the top applications include content creation (44%), data analysis and information gathering (41%), and marketing and sales strategies (39%).

The majority of owners using Gen AI have found that adoption doesn't require a massive investment. Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) Gen AI users report spending less than $50 a month on it, and nearly 1 in 5 (18%) are using free tools or subscriptions. These tools allow users to spend more time on the personal connection they have with their customers (88%).

Still, the rise of AI is not without tension. Over 8 in 10 (81%) report keeping up with technological advancements such as Gen AI is stressful, and 56% worry their business (or products / services) will be replaced by Gen AI or automation.

Beyond AI, digital tools are seen as essential now more than ever. The number of owners who view digital tools as very important or essential jumped a striking 15 percentage points from last year (87% in 2025 vs. 72% in 2024). At the same time, 63% say they're overwhelmed by the number of tools needed to run their business and 82% say consolidating them is a priority.

Looking at payment methods, nearly half (48%) of owners still report cash as a primary method of in-person payment. However, newer methods of payment are catching up with 42% reporting tap-to-pay as a primary method.

Despite Challenges, Most Owners Would Do It Again

Even amid today's business challenges, most small business owners remain grounded in their original purpose that inspired them to become entrepreneurs. When asked why they launched their business, 90% say they wanted to be their own boss, 88% cited a desire to control their financial future, and 86% wanted their passions to be part of their work.

Legacy has also played a defining role. More than two-thirds (67%) of owners come from a family of entrepreneurs, and 62% took over a relative's business to carry on their family legacy. For Gen Z and Millennial entrepreneurs, however, the path to ownership has often been shaped by necessity. More than half (52%) of younger owners say they became business owners because they couldn't find a job elsewhere, compared to 44% of Gen X and Boomer owners.

When asked if they'd do it all over again, 80% of owners say they'd still start their business today. This confidence is particularly notable given challenges they see in today's environment. Almost 8 in 10 (79%) say there is greater market competition today than when they started and 70% say that securing funding and capital is more difficult now.

For investors, WNS's shares are a trap—locked into a declining BPO model while bearing the costs of Capgemini's AI ambitions.","The $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS by Capgemini, announced in July 2025, is framed as a marriage of AI innovation and BPO expertise. However, beneath the surface, this deal exposes critical misalignments between Capgemini's AI-first vision and WNS's labor-intensive business model, compounded by rising semiconductor costs and geopolitical fragmentation. For investors, the risks of overvaluation, operational dissonance, and shifting market dynamics far outweigh the perceived synergies. Here's why the deal may prove a costly misstep—and where to look for safer returns.

Strategic Misalignment: AI vs. Labor-Heavy BPO

Capgemini's push to build “Intelligent Operations” relies on advanced AI frameworks like its Resonance platform, which require cutting-edge semiconductor-driven infrastructure. WNS, however, derives 85%+ of its revenue from traditional labor-heavy BPO services—data processing, back-office operations, and IT support—for industries like healthcare and manufacturing. This model thrives on cost arbitrage, not algorithmic innovation.

The clash is twofold:

1. Cost Structure Mismatch: WNS's 18.7% operating margin in FY2025 depends on low-cost offshore labor. Capgemini's AI strategy demands high-margin, capital-intensive R&D and semiconductor-driven compute power. Integrating these could strain Capgemini's balance sheet, especially as global semiconductor costs rise due to supply chain bottlenecks.

2. Market Realities: The BPO sector is contracting as enterprises automate with generative AI. WNS's Q2 2025 revenue fell 4.4% YoY, with attrition rates near 34%—a red flag in an industry reliant on labor retention. Meanwhile, Capgemini's AI projects demand expertise in chips, cloud infrastructure, and data governance—areas where WNS has no comparative advantage.

Valuation Overreach: A 17% Premium for a Fragile Asset

The $76.50-per-share offer represents a 17% premium over WNS's pre-announcement price. Yet WNS's valuation already incorporates optimistic assumptions:

- Synergy Overreach: Capgemini projects 4-7% EPS accretion by 2027 via $100–140M cross-selling and $50–70M cost savings. But WNS's declining revenue and Capgemini's tepid 2025 targets (-2% to +2% revenue growth) suggest these synergies are overly optimistic.

- Margin Pressures: WNS's operating margin has shrunk from 21.5% in 2024 to 18.6% in Q2 2025. Integrating its BPO operations into Capgemini's AI ecosystem could exacerbate margin erosion, especially as AI infrastructure costs balloon.

Geopolitical and Semiconductor Risks

The deal's risks extend beyond financials:

- Supply Chain Fragmentation: The U.S.-China tech cold war has disrupted semiconductor supplies. Capgemini's AI ambitions require advanced chips (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs), which are increasingly subject to export controls. WNS's BPO model, meanwhile, relies on low-cost labor hubs like India and the Philippines—regions vulnerable to geopolitical instability.

- Semiconductor Cost Inflation: AI workloads demand more compute power, which is directly tied to semiconductor availability. Rising chip prices (up 12% YoY in H1 2025) could squeeze Capgemini's margins, while WNS's BPO model offers no relief.

Investment Implications: Avoid WNS, Hedge with Semiconductors

The Capgemini-WNS deal presents three clear risks for investors:

1. Overvaluation of WNS: Its premium pricing ignores structural declines in BPO demand and margin pressures.

2. Integration Pitfalls: Merging AI-driven tech with labor-heavy BPO is akin to mixing oil and water.

3. Exposure to Tech Fragmentation: The deal amplifies Capgemini's reliance on global supply chains, now at risk from sanctions and nationalism.

A Better Play: Semiconductor Leaders

Instead of betting on WNS's overvalued shares, investors should focus on semiconductor infrastructure plays:

- ASML (ASML): Dominates EUV lithography, essential for advanced AI chips. Its stock has outperformed Capgemini's by 40% over five years.

- Lam Research (LRCX): Critical for semiconductor fabrication, with pricing power amid chip shortages.

These companies benefit directly from AI's compute demands and are less exposed to BPO's headwinds.

Conclusion: A Deal Built on Shifting Sands

The Capgemini-WNS acquisition reflects a dangerous confluence of overvaluation, strategic mismatch, and macro risks. For investors, WNS's shares are a trap—locked into a declining BPO model while bearing the costs of Capgemini's AI ambitions. Instead, hedging with semiconductor leaders like ASML and LRCX offers a safer path to profiting from the AI revolution.

Dive Brief:

JPMorgan Chase is working to allow voluntary carbon markets to issue blockchain tokens at the registry level that represent ownership of carbon credits, permitting market participants to issue, transfer and retire credits, the bank announced Wednesday.

JPMorgan is currently exploring testing processes with carbon registries from S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry through its blockchain business unit, Kinexys, according to the July 2 release.

The three registries are testing the viability of carbon credit tokenization, as JPMorgan hopes its solution will bring more data transparency to the market and allow for additional market token standardization, according to a report accompanying the announcement.

Dive Insight:

Bringing carbon registries to blockchain and creating a “single, tokenized carbon ecosystem” that allows carbon credit sellers and buyers to seamlessly interact and transfer credits, JPMorgan said, could help address issues of transparency, lack of standardization and market fragmentation.

The bank is currently developing an app to allow the carbon registries to represent ownership, data attributes and rules for the assets in a digital token and directly issue and track credits on the Kinexys Digital Assets Blockchain platform. JPMorgan launched the blockchain business unit to allow for tokenization of financial assets and to utilize other blockchain benefits. The unit has processed more than $1.5 trillion in transactions in the three years since it began serving clients, according to its webpage.

J.P. Morgan Payments Head of Natural Resource Advisory Alastair Northway said in the release that the “voluntary carbon market is ripe for innovation.”

“Tokenization could support development of a globally interoperable system that adds confidence into the integrity of the underlying infrastructure,” Northway said. “This technology could support greater information and price transparency, which could ultimately lead to greater liquidity in the market.”

The bank said in its report that native tokenization projects, like the one it’s undertaking, “can be difficult to implement in use cases based around mature markets with long-established registers and system integrations.” However, JPMorgan said that given the relative nascency and concentration of the voluntary carbon markets — where a small number of registries account for “85-90% of assets issued,” according to the report — it believes there is a greater potential for faster adoption.

While the creation of a tokenization standard, with embedded project and credit attributes, would aid issues of data transparency and lack of standardization across the market, JPMorgan said its application is “not an authority on [credit] quality.” The bank said the application’s role is “to enforce standardized data structures, improve transparency, strengthen resiliency and enable users to independently assess and interpret the available information for specific projects and credits on our platform.”

The carbon registries will look to allow external stakeholders to more easily read and act on registry data. In addition to the viability of tokenization, the registries will test Kinexys’ capabilities for account, project and credit lifecycle management and include specific objectives to explore the application’s technical connectivity, compatibility with different data models and its overall functionality.

Verdict: A Worthwhile Bet on Regional Power Barclays' Middle East leadership shift is more than a managerial tweak—it's a strategic masterstroke to tap into a region where capital is abundant and demand is soaring.","Barclays has placed a bold bet on the Middle East's surging financial influence by appointing Khaled El Dabag and Walid Mezher as Co-CEOs for its regional operations. This dual leadership structure, effective July 2025, aims to capitalize on the region's growing role in global capital markets while aligning with the bank's broader three-year strategy to streamline operations and boost returns. The move underscores Barclays' ambition to turn the Middle East into a profit engine, blending the complementary expertise of two veterans whose careers have been defined by shaping the region's financial landscape.

The Co-CEO Play: Why El Dabag and Mezher?

El Dabag, with 25 years of investment banking experience in Dubai and New York, brings deep expertise in structuring deals for corporate clients, particularly in energy and infrastructure. As former head of MENA Investment Banking, he has steered Barclays' advisory role in landmark transactions, such as the privatization of Saudi Aramco's downstream assets. Mezher, meanwhile, has spent 19 years at Barclays, most recently leading Markets activities across the Middle East and Africa. His focus on sales, origination, and debt capital markets positions him to drive growth in trading and client execution—a critical edge as regional wealth surges.

Their partnership is designed to eliminate silos between Barclays' Investment Banking and Markets divisions, enabling faster decision-making and cross-selling opportunities. Stephen Dainton, BBPLC President, emphasized the strategic imperative: “The Middle East is no longer a side note—it's a linchpin of global finance. This structure ensures Barclays can act as a unified partner to clients in a region where capital flows are accelerating.”

Strategic Alignment: Efficiency Meets Ambition

The co-CEO model directly supports Barclays' three-year plan to become “Simpler, Better, and More Balanced” by 2026. Key targets include:- £500 million in cost savings by 2025 (already £150M achieved in Q1 2024), driven by operational streamlining.- Reducing the Investment Bank's share of Group RWA to 50% by 2026, freeing capital for higher-return divisions like UK retail banking.- 11% ROTE by 2025, rising to over 12% by 2026—targets already exceeded by the Investment Bank, which delivered 16.2% ROTE in Q1 2024.

The Middle East fits seamlessly into this framework. By unifying Investment Banking and Markets under one leadership team, Barclays can:1. Leverage client relationships across both divisions, from sovereign wealth funds to family offices.2. Cut costs by eliminating redundant processes, such as overlapping sales teams or technology platforms.3. Accelerate deal flow in sectors like energy transition, real estate, and tech—areas where Middle Eastern capital is flowing aggressively.

The Prize: A Region on Fire

The Middle East's financial ascendancy is undeniable. Sovereign wealth funds now hold over $3.2 trillion in assets, and private wealth is projected to grow at 7% annually through 2030. Barclays is well-positioned to benefit:- Private banking: The appointment of Farzad Billimoria as UAE Private Bank head signals a push to capture high-net-worth clients, particularly in wealth hubs like Dubai and Riyadh.- Debt capital markets: Mezher's expertise in structuring debt deals aligns with demand for infrastructure financing, from UAE's Expo City to Qatar's World Cup legacy projects.- ESG integration: Barclays' focus on sustainable investing—distinguishing between ethical, responsible, and impact investing—can attract ESG-focused capital, a priority for younger Middle Eastern investors.

Investment Implications: Risk and Reward

Barclays' Middle East pivot offers two clear catalysts for investors:1. Cost discipline: The £500M savings target, if met, could structurally improve margins. A cost-to-income ratio of 61% by 2025 would put Barclays on par with peers like HSBC.2. Regional growth: A 12% ROTE target by 2026, achievable if Middle East revenue outperforms, could lift shares. The bank's Q1 2024 results—net profit up 20% to £1.86B—hint at progress.

Risks remain, however. Geopolitical tensions, such as Iran's nuclear talks or Gulf rivalries, could disrupt markets. Additionally, Barclays' US Consumer Bank, which dragged ROTE to 4.5% in Q1 2024, demands close scrutiny. Yet the Middle East's momentum suggests Barclays is placing its best foot forward in the right market.

Verdict: A Worthwhile Bet on Regional Power

Barclays' Middle East leadership shift is more than a managerial tweak—it's a strategic masterstroke to tap into a region where capital is abundant and demand is soaring. For investors, this aligns with the bank's broader efficiency push, which could deliver double-digit ROTE by 2026. While risks persist, Barclays' early wins in cost savings and deal flow suggest it's primed to outperform in a high-growth arena. Consider this a long-term play for those betting on the Middle East's rise—and Barclays' role in it.",,N,,2025-07-07 15:07:07.215594

(Reuters) -UPS, FedEx and other private parcel carriers are busy cornering a bigger share of the nearly $17 billion Canadian delivery market, while government-owned Canada Post copes with labor turmoil.

Canada Post, the country's primary postal service, has been plagued by labor disruptions since last year, including during the peak holiday season as workers went on strike over pay.

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), representing delivery personnel at Canada Post, initiated a nationwide overtime ban in May after contract negotiations failed.

The repeated disruptions have prompted small businesses to turn to rivals and private carriers for timely deliveries, even if they are more expensive.

""For retailers who can't afford to roll the dice on labor peace, their T-shirts and iPhone cases hop over to brown or purple vans (UPS/FedEx) at the first whiff of trouble,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at wealth management company Running Point Capital.

Parcel giant FedEx told Reuters it expects ""the circumstances at Canada Post may trigger an increase in demand for FedEx services.""

The company may offer special rates, add delivery vehicles, re-work routes, reallocate resources and open temporary sorting centers to handle the additional demand.

UPS declined to divulge its plans to boost capacity.

Calgary-based Lisa Graham, who runs a small e-commerce based business called YYC Beeswax, told Reuters her business relied heavily on Canada Post's affordable small-package rates for domestic shipments.

But after the business suffered some losses during last year's holiday season strikes, Graham turned to UPS and FedEx to keep deliveries running, and enlisted local courier services to supply domestic customers, who make up 70% of her sales.

""Anything that's going to take over two days, we are spending extra to ship with them (private courier services).""

Last year's strikes cost small and medium-sized businesses over $1 billion in lost sales, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said.

Michael Cox, who imports Irish sweaters, textiles, jewelry, and other goods from the UK to his Ottawa-based shop, said he had to halt business during last year's strikes, as Canada Post was its sole logistics provider — causing significant losses.

The Canadian courier, express, and parcel market is valued at $16.74 billion and could hit $21.55 billion by 2030, according to Mordor Intelligence.

The impact of the ongoing uncertainty, including last year's strikes, has been significant on our business, a Canada Post spokesperson said.

""Since the union restarted their strike action in May 2025 once the collective agreements expired, we have lost almost 60% of our business.""

Canada Post's market share plunged to 26.7% in 2024 from 62% in 2019, according to the company's annual report, despite a post-pandemic e-commerce boom in deliveries.

It lost $208 million due to last year's 32-day strike.

""If CUPW's contract slug-fest drags on, Canada Post's share could drop into the teens by December 2026,"" Schulman added.

It was the fifth successive survey period in which the PMI has posted below the critical 50.0 no-change mark.

That was down from 46.1 in the previous month and indicative of another decline in operating conditions. It was the fifth successive survey period in which the PMI has posted below the critical 50.0 no-change mark.

Production volumes fell in June at the sharpest pace in over five years, driven by a significant drop in new orders. Tariffs were frequently cited as a key factor negatively affecting market demand, contributing to a fifth consecutive monthly decline in overall sales. International demand, particularly from the neighboring U.S., remained weak. The latest data indicated that new export orders fell in June at one of the fastest rates recorded in the survey’s history.

According to S&P Global, some panellists expressed optimism that trade uncertainty linked to tariffs may ease over the next year, while others anticipated stronger sales from domestic markets. As a result, business confidence reportedly rose to its highest level since January, showing a marked improvement compared to May.

However, compared to the survey’s historical average, confidence remained subdued. This was largely the result of difficulties in forecasting the direction of trade policies and tariff levels with the neighbouring United States.

Ongoing declines in both output and new orders led firms to continue cutting back on purchasing activity at a historically sharp rate. Input inventories also fell, marking the steepest drop in five years. In addition to intentional stock reduction, delays in receiving purchased inputs reportedly prompted firms to draw more heavily on existing inventories. Average lead times significantly lengthened again in June.

Commenting on the latest survey results, Paul Smith, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “Canada’s manufacturing economy continued to struggle in the face of tariffs and the ongoing uncertainty related to future trade policies. A lack of new orders underpinned the latest downturn and helped to explain the steepest reduction in production since the height of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. International sales unsurprisingly were especially subdued, and, against this backdrop, firms chose to make further cuts to their employment and purchasing activity.

“Although sentiment improved on hopes of some stability in the year ahead, confidence in the outlook remains subdued and uncertain. And firms continued to face pressure on their operating margins as, despite easing since May, inflationary pressures were again evident. Tariffs again drove steep rises in prices and also exacerbated supply-side delays, which intensified during June.”

Tariffs were widely reported to have also driven up input costs during June, dominating the anecdotal evidence provided by those manufacturers that experienced a rise in prices. Although the rate of inflation softened during June to a four-month low, it remained elevated compared to the survey trend. Manufacturers sought to pass on their higher input costs to clients via a rise in their own selling prices during June. Similarly, the rate of inflation remained marked, despite easing to a four-month low.

Finally, with production and new order volumes deteriorating sharply, there remained little pressure on capacity during June. This was highlighted by another steep, and accelerated, fall in backlogs of work. Manufacturers subsequently also registered a decline in staffing volumes. It was the fifth successive month in which overall employment fell and reflected a mixture of redundancies and the non-replacement of leavers.",https://www.plant.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-10.58.34 AM.png,N,,2025-07-07 15:08:37.392092

The Spyral GEMINI study Medtronic’s Spyral GEMINI pilot study will enroll up to 175 hypertensive patients in the U.S, Europe and Australia.
Physicians will use the Symplicity Spyral catheter for denervation in both the common hepatic and main renal arteries and branches.
“As a pioneer in renal denervation, Medtronic is uniquely positioned to explore the clinical potential of multi-organ denervation with Symplicity Spyral’s low profile and single catheter design, and intellectual property in this field,” Medtronic SVP and Coronary and Renal Denervation President Jason Weidman said in the news release.","Medtronic today said the first patient has been treated in its pilot study of multi-organ denervation using its nitinol-enabled Symplicity Spyral catheter technology.

The Spyral GEMINI pilot program (an abbreviation for Global pilot study of rEnal and hepatic coMbINed denervatIon) includes off-med and on-med studies investigating the safety and potential efficacy for denervation of both the renal and common haptic (liver) arteries in uncontrolled hypertension patients.

“In addition to denervation of the renal arteries — where the blood pressure lowering clinical benefit has already been established through multiple rigorously designed clinical trials — targeting other richly innervated vascular areas such as the common hepatic artery is an emerging horizon for treating hypertension,” said the study’s lead principal investigator, Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Services Chief Dr. David Kandzari, in a Medtronic news release. “We look forward to learning more about the potential efficacy of denervation in both the liver and renal arteries from Spyral GEMINI.”

Medtronic said preclinical data presented at EuroPCR in May “showed a 90% significant reduction in norepinephrine (marker of sympathetic activity) with multi-organ denervation.”

“These findings suggest that multi-organ denervation using the Spyral system can successfully denervate within both the hepatic and renal arteries,” the company continued.

Medtronic Renal Denervation (RDN) GM Jason Fontana previously explained the next-generation Project Gemini approach in an interview with MassDevice sister site Medical Design & Outsourcing.

In that interview, Fontana said the device manufacturer had fully developed a new minimally invasive catheter for wrist access that could be on the market sometime in 2026, and that the current radiofrequency (RF) generator should work for the procedure given appropriate adjustments to the RF energy delivery algorithm.

Medtronic won FDA approval for RDN in 2023 along with Recor Medical, which uses an ultrasound catheter. Those companies are waging a patent battle over their competing technologies.

Hepatic denervation has not been approved by the FDA or any other device regulator, with Medtronic saying the investigational generator and catheter used in the study is not authorized for sale or use anywhere in the world.

The Spyral GEMINI study

Medtronic’s Spyral GEMINI pilot study will enroll up to 175 hypertensive patients in the U.S, Europe and Australia.

The study will have two parallel cohorts, including patients off anti-hypertensive medications and patients with high cardiovascular risk who are taking anti-hypertensive medications. Physicians will use the Symplicity Spyral catheter for denervation in both the common hepatic and main renal arteries and branches.

Medtronic said procedural safety and efficacy evaluation will start three months after the procedures and continue for three years.

The first patient was treated by Dr. Barry Bertolet at Cardiology Associates of North Mississippi and North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo.

“As a pioneer in renal denervation, Medtronic is uniquely positioned to explore the clinical potential of multi-organ denervation with Symplicity Spyral’s low profile and single catheter design, and intellectual property in this field,” Medtronic SVP and Coronary and Renal Denervation President Jason Weidman said in the news release. “As a company, Medtronic is committed to investing in strategically important areas that hold promise for patients and the medical community.”",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Medtronic-Symplicty-Spyral-RDN-renal-denervation-ablation.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 15:08:27.258328

The agreement includes wage increases, fully funded health and pension benefits, and job security for returning workers.

All striking workers were instructed to return to their jobs by July 7.

Picket lines came down July 5 for striking Safeway and Albertsons workers in Pueblo and across Colorado after a tentative agreement was struck between the corporate grocery chain and the union representing its workers.

In a July 5 news release, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 announced the strike lines would be coming down that day.

The agreement ending the 20-day strike, which UFCW Local 7 referred to as an “all gains, no concessions agreement,” for the union, includes 45 tentative agreements, according to the UFCW Local 7 release.

Those agreements include: fully funded healthcare benefits, including improved dental and vision benefits and an increased life insurance benefit; fully funded pension benefits; no cuts to retiree health care benefits; “strong” wage increases; and a longevity bonus for all associates with at least one year of seniority.

The agreement also includes a provision for a new “test-and-learn trial” to study staffing improvements in stores and no giveaways of bargaining unit work to gig companies like DoorDash.

UFCW Local 7 President Kim Cordova did not immediately respond to a request for additional information from the Chieftain.

When the strike was announced in early June, UFCW Local 7 officials identified staffing, wages, and the need for fully funded workers' health and pension benefits as the primary drivers of the strike.

“We are pleased to have reached a fair and equitable agreement with the UFCW that will benefit our associates and allow us to continue to serve our customers in Colorado,” a Safeway spokesperson said in a written statement to the Chieftain.

As part of the deal with UFCW Local 7, Safeway agreed to terminate all temporary replacement workers, with all striking workers “guaranteed to be returned to their same position, classification, seniority, and hire date,” according to the release.

All striking workers were directed to return to work by July 7 at the latest.

More than 200 Pueblo and Pueblo West Safeway workers voted May 31 to join the strike, with 100% of meat department employees and 97% of retail employees at the two local stores — located at 1231 S. Prairie Ave. in Pueblo, and 1017 N. Market Place in Pueblo West — voting to strike.

The union went through with the strike on June 15 and Pueblo was among the first cities to participate.

UnitedHealth Leads The Downturn Amidst Guidance Withdrawal And CEO Resignation

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) led the downturn with a staggering 40.9% drop in market cap in the second quarter and a 39.6% decline year over year, triggered largely by its decision to withdraw 2025 earnings guidance.

UnitedHealth's CEO, Andrew Witty, resigned for personal reasons, and the previous CEO, Stephen Hemsley, succeeded him. The company also withdrew 2025 guidance.

Despite the significant drop, UnitedHealth retained its top spot as the largest U.S. insurer, with a market cap of $283 billion, well ahead of second-ranked The Progressive Corp. (NYSE:PGR), which stood at $156.44 billion.

Among the eight companies that saw market cap declines of more than 5%, half were managed care firms. In contrast, five of the six insurers with gains were property and casualty providers, reflecting stronger investor confidence in that sector.

Despite the significant drop, UnitedHealth retained its top spot as the largest U.S. insurer, with a market cap of $283 billion. That still puts it well ahead of second-ranked The Progressive Corp. (NYSE:PGR), which stood at $156.44 billion.

Ripple Effect: Other Health Insurers Follow Suit

Other health insurers followed UnitedHealth's downward trajectory. Centene Corp. (NYSE:CNC) saw its market cap drop 10.3% in the second quarter, while Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV) declined 10.8%. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) posted more modest losses of 7.6% and 1%, respectively.

Third-Quarter Woes Intensify With Policy Uncertainty

The pressure has extended into the third quarter. Last week, Centene also withdrew its 2025 guidance, sending the market into shock. The result was a 40.37% stock plunge in a single day. The fallout also affected peers, with UnitedHealth and Elevance falling 5.7% and 11.5%, respectively.

Investor sentiment was further rattled by President Donald Trump's proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which appears close to congressional approval.

The S&P report added that the legislation could significantly impact Medicaid access, a key business area for managed care insurers like UnitedHealth and Centene that administer the program through government funding. The policy risk triggered another selloff in the first week of the third quarter.

Broader Insurance Industry Shows Resilience

Still, the broader insurance industry has shown resilience. At the end of the second quarter, the S&P 500 insurance index climbed 19.55% year over year, surpassing the S&P 500's 15.16% gain during the same period.

The GLP-1 obesity med soared to the top of the month’s ranking of TV drug ad spenders, according to data shared with Fierce Pharma Marketing by iSpot.TV, repeating an occurrence last seen in March.

Novo shelled out just under $40 million to air one Wegovy ad throughout the month of June—quite a ways above its $24.1 million outlay in May, when it slipped to fifth place in the rankings, and almost even with the $40.4 million spend that earned it the top spot in March.

And, just like the last time it was on top, Wegovy once again capitalized on a major basketball event taking over TV screens: According to iSpot, the top TV program for the drug’s singular commercial in June was NBA coverage, as the league’s championship series played out throughout the month. In March, Wegovy’s top TV program by spend was men’s college basketball, amid the kickoff of the annual NCAA March Madness tournament.

Wegovy’s sister drug, meanwhile, stayed put toward the bottom of the top 10 list in June. Ozempic held onto its ninth-place ranking from May, with $11.5 million spent airing a pair of commercials.

Falling in line behind Wegovy was a trio of mainstays on the monthly rankings, as AbbVie’s Skyrizi and Rinvoq and Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya took the next three slots, respectively. TV ad spending for Rinvoq and Tremfya notched upward, while Skyrizi’s fell to $30.3 million for the month, compared to the $34.2 million outlay that earned it the No. 1 spot in May.

Next up, Lundbeck and Otsuka’s Rexulti, Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance and Lilly’s Zepbound each jumped one spot compared with their May rankings, thanks in large part to a major drop in spending for Dupixent’s TV advertising. In May, Sanofi and Regeneron threw more than $28 million behind the immunology med, sending it up to second place in the month’s analysis; in June, that spending was slashed by more than 50% to $13.8 million, pushing it down to No. 8.

Behind Ozempic, rounding out June’s biggest TV ad spenders was Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, which made its triumphant return to the monthly top 10 lists for the first time since May 2024, with $10.3 million spent airing a single commercial.

All together, the top 10 brands poured $219.4 million into airing their TV ads in June, continuing the steady downward trend logged almost every month this year after January’s staggering $302.5 million total.

That said, 2025’s monthly totals so far have also adhered to another, more positive trend, with each significantly outperforming the top 10 list a year prior. Last June, for example, the biggest spenders shelled out a combined $151.7 million for their TV ads, meaning this June’s results surged nearly 45% year over year, even as they dropped sequentially from May’s $221.1 million total.

BNP Paribas said it is adapting its governance, aiming to strengthen the cross-functionality between its businesses.

The French lender said Monday that its commercial, personal banking and services division will have a new unit encompassing the commercial and personal-banking businesses in the eurozone. The new unit will be led by Yannick Jung, who is currently head of corporate and institutional banking global banking.

The company is also making changes at its corporate and institutional banking division, which will now consist of an executive chairman and a chief executive. Consequently, the group's Chief Operating Officer Yann Gerardin will also become executive chairman of the business. Olivier Osty, current head of CIB Global Markets, will become deputy chief operating officer of the group and CEO of the division.

The investment and protection services business will continue to accelerate its development under the responsibility of Renaud Dumora, the group's deputy chief operating officer, helped by external growth operations, primarily the acquisition of AXA IM.

These appointments will take place from Sept. 1.

S&P Global's Q2 results are generating interest with a stronger-than-expected performance, thanks to a June surge in credit issuance that offset earlier quarter dips.

What does this mean?

Initially, S&P Global faced a cautious period with a softer credit market outlook. However, a 13% rise in June credit issuance changed the narrative. Morgan Stanley revised their outlook for S&P Global's ratings revenue to a 2% decline from a projected 5% drop. This positive shift led to a 2% increase in EPS estimates, boosting confidence in S&P Global's annual guidance and suggesting a more optimistic trajectory for the year. The firm's stock price rose to $530.90, reinforcing its reputation as a resilient player in the financial landscape.

Why should I care?

For markets: Credit markets rebound.

These developments highlight a recovering credit landscape, with major implications for market volatility and stability. S&P Global's strong performance and revised projections signal potential growth, making it a company to watch for investors focused on financial sector resilience and opportunity.

The bigger picture: Optimism in financial outlooks.

Earlier this year, Buc-ee’s sued a Florida store, accusing it of selling merchandise sporting what appears to be the beloved beaver logo with punk rock makeovers.
Buc-ee’s stores are open all day, every day.","(NEXSTAR) — It’s been a busy few weeks for Buc-ee’s, the Texas-based convenience store and gas station chain that has developed a cult following in recent years.

In early June, Buc-ee’s opened its first Mississippi location in Harrison County. Last week, the company opened its first Virginia location and its third store in Georgia.

As of early July, Buc-ee’s operates 54 stores across nine states, with other stores in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The company has undergone a major multi-state expansion since 2019, and it isn’t done yet.

Buc-ee’s has several more sites that are already under construction.

In April, work began on the Buc-ee’s location in Benton, Arkansas, at what it described as the largest groundbreaking event in company history. Another Arkansas location in West Memphis is on track to open next year as well. CEO Arch “Beaver” Aplin III hinted at a potential third location for Arkansas while speaking with Nexstar’s KLRT.

Ohio expects to get its first Buc-ee’s in 2026. Construction began in August 2024 on the location in Huber Heights, located northeast of Dayton. However, work was briefly paused amid a conflict over sewer and water services. The company confirmed to Nexstar’s WDTN that the planned opening in late 2025 had been pushed to spring of next year.

Buc-ee’s is also on track to open locations in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Ocala and Fort Pierce, Florida; Monroe County, Georgia; Ruston and Lafayette, Louisiana; and Goodyear, Arizona. Stores in Louisiana and Arizona mark the first in each state for Buc-ee’s.

The company’s Mebane, North Carolina, store — the state’s first — is expected to open in 2026 or 2027.

Three additional Buc-ee’s could open in 2027: Gallaway, Tennessee; Oak Creek, Wisconsin; and Kansas City, Missouri.

Buc-ee’s has pursued locations in eight more areas:

San Marcos, Texas

Palmer Lake, Colorado

Harbour Heights, Florida

Anderson, South Carolina

Hardeeville, South Carolina

Oak Grove City, Kentucky

Boerne, Texas

These locations are at various steps in the process, according to local reporting.

Construction has begun on the location in Boerne. No timeline for opening the store has been released.

Oak Creek, located about 10 miles south of Milwaukee, announced Buc-ee’s had submitted a proposal for a massive location after plans to build one near Madison stalled. Despite pushback from some residents, the city’s common council approved the plans in May. Construction could begin later this year, according to local outlet WISN.

In Palmer Lake, the board of trustees approved an annexation request for a proposed Buc-ee’s during a contentious meeting in May, Nexstar’s KXRM reported. Residents have also pushed back against a proposed Buc-ee’s location in southwest Florida, expressing concerns that it could exacerbate flooding in the area and encroach on a wildlife habitat.

The Buc-ee’s in Anderson was delayed earlier this year due to a nearby interchange. Local leaders told Nexstar’s WSPA it would cost about $60 million to fix the interchange, the brunt of which they believe should come from the state.

Should all these locations be built and opened before 2027, Buc-ee’s will have more than 70 locations across 17 states.

Buc-ee’s did not immediately respond to Nexstar’s request for comment or additional information.

The first store of the Texas-based chain opened in 1982, but its first true travel center opened in 2003. That location, in Luling, outside of San Antonio, was damaged in a fire last year. A month prior, that Buc-ee’s had been replaced by a new travel center in the same area.

It’s the massive travel centers — featuring everything from fuel and snacks to Buc-ee’s merchandise, hot food, kitchen items, grills, and even hunting gear — that have seemingly attracted a cult-like following to the brand. The company’s beloved mascot, Buc-ee the Beaver, receives just as much adoration.

He’s also been at the center of recent lawsuits from Buc-ee’s. Earlier this year, Buc-ee’s sued a Florida store, accusing it of selling merchandise sporting what appears to be the beloved beaver logo with punk rock makeovers.

Customers can also reach out to Costco to get a full or prorated refund, based on the purchase date or the date of the unit's manufacture.

There have been several other items recalled by Costco as well, including Anker power banks, which are used for portable charging. There is a potential risk factor with these power banks, which were sold between June 1, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2022, due to the possibility that they ""may overheat, posing a potential fire safety risk,"" which ""could lead to melting of plastic components, smoke or fire,"" per the recall. Anyone who has purchased one of these power banks can reach out for a refund or a replacement with a photo of the product showing the serial number on the back, model number, date the photo was taken, and the word ""recalled"" written on the power bank in permanent marker.

Costco has also recalled Bridgestone Blizzak 6 tires and Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires. The Bridgetstone tires were sold as replacement tires only and ""do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 139,"" per the recall, while the Michelin tires were recalled as ""chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.""

Other Costco items that have been recalled include the 18 packs of Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass, Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler, Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer, Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter and the Sublue Underwater Scooter.

Duvivier is currently serving as president, international and has worked at Krispy Kreme since 2019.

Prior to Krispy Kreme, he held various positions in global finance, development and operations at Restaurant Brands International.

“[Duvivier’s] deep understanding of the Company coupled with his strong finance background will enable a smooth transition as we focus on achieving sustainable, profitable growth,” Josh Charlesworth, Krispy Kreme’s CEO, said in a statement.

Ashukian informed the company of his intent to leave on June 27, as did Chief Growth Officer David Skena, according to an 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.

Food giant Kraft Heinz is recalling more than 360,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon products for possible listeria contamination.

Affected products include fully cooked turkey bacon produced from April 24 through June 11, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Products were shipped across the U.S., with some exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses have been reported, FSIS said. The possible contamination was discovered through Kraft Heinz's internal laboratory testing.

Dive Insight:

Major food companies have grappled with high-profile listeria recalls. Last September, Boar's Head closed a facility months after an outbreak led to nine deaths and more than 7 million pounds of recalled meat.

Deli meats and ready-to-eat products are among the foods most susceptible to listeria contamination, since pathogens aren't destroyed in the refrigeration process. There were 65 recalls over potential listeria contamination in 2024, compared to 47 the prior year, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

Following large-scale outbreaks last year, the USDA released a plan to ramp up listeria inspections at meat plants. However, a scientific advisory committee tasked with overseeing the regulatory strategy was terminated in March as part of the Trump administration's effort to slash costs and streamline the government.

Consuming food contaminated with listeria can lead to Listeriosis, which can be especially harmful for pregnant women, newborns and those over the age of 65. Symptoms can appear sometimes weeks after eating contaminated food, according to the FSIS.

Earnings forecasts for Greggs PLC (LSE:GRG) for this year and next were cut by Barclays following weaker-than-expected trading and a recent unscheduled update, where the company had blamed hot weather for its poor performance.

Discussions with the company indicate that hot weather was the single largest reason for the downgrade, as the company had bemoaned. However, analysts noted that some investors had questioned this, as not all parts of the UK experienced a heatwave.

""Our analysis of previous Greggs trading updates during hot weather suggests that the heat wave is a credible explanation of weaker trading, but we believe that as the business sells more cold drinks vs much earlier in its history, the impact of warm weather has become less severe.""

Raising broader concerns about pricing strategy, over-expansion, and dependence on a recovery in consumer spending, Barclays now expects FY25 LFL sales growth of 2%, down from 3% previously.

The broker noted a potential shift in consumer behaviour away from food-to-go and questioned whether recent price increases have softened volumes.

The deal marks one of the largest buyouts in the BPM space and underscores the growing demand for AI-powered, digitally integrated business solutions. Both companies have a strong footprint in India, together employing over 200,000 people across 24 locations in the country.

With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in business process services, the transaction will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys, said the company.

Scale, sector edge

“Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,” said Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini, adding that WNS’s high growth, margin accretive Digital Business Process Services will increase the company’s exposure to the US market, unlocking immediate cross-selling opportunities.

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, said, “WNS’ complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini’s rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.”

Finding synergies

One of the key challenges could be finding synergies between employees of the two companies. During an analyst call, Capgemini said there is currently no “refined plan” for integrating the two companies, but confirmed that post-merger management teams will include leaders from both Capgemini and WNS. The company also noted that its European headcount will decline from 35 per cent to 30 per cent, while its offshore workforce is expected to rise from 58 per cent to 63 per cent as a result of the merger.

Ashutosh Sharma, VP & Research Director, Forrester, said the acquisition demonstrates the impact of AI in reshaping business processes. “Capgemini gains scale and process depth, while WNS taps into cutting-edge AI capabilities. While there may be no immediate disruption to the workforce or their India operations, the long-term trajectory is clear: automation will drive significant efficiency gains which in turn will inevitably lead to workforce optimisation,” said Sharma.

Similarly, Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO and Chief Analyst at Greyhound Research, argued the move should be seen as a control-layer acquisition where it can use WNS’s operational foundation, trusted by over 600 clients across banking, healthcare, travel, utilities, and more.

“Capgemini is betting that in a GenAI-led market, the differentiation will come from who can embed the models into real processes, in real-time, across real industries. That’s where WNS’s BPO playbook — historically focused on outcome-based pricing, F&A maturity, and embedded analytics — provides a ready-made testbed for Capgemini to deploy its AI stack,” said Gogia.

Bob Bastian: Because we're a regulated business, we give a lot of thought to how we're using AI.
On the sales side, we're using agentic AI to help with call logging.
What advice do you have for your peers experimenting with or evaluating agentic AI?","Prudential Financial might have been founded in 1875, but its IT stack is definitely next-generation.

The 150-year-old company has 38,000 employees who serve 50 million customers in more than 50 countries. Bob Bastian, chief information and technology officer, leads the company's agentic AI initiative, which is built on Salesforce's Agentforce for Financial Services.

We discussed with Bastian the company's deliberate approach to rolling out AI services for its various insurance, retirement products and mutual funds.

How would you describe Prudential's AI strategy?

Bob Bastian: Because we're a regulated business, we give a lot of thought to how we're using AI. Our main strategy is thinking about how to build governance so it does exactly what we need it to do for our customers and stakeholders, but at the same time, it's protected, it's governed and we think about data management right out of the gate.

Then we say, ""Where would it provide the most value for our customers or advisors?"" We've created various use cases that help us understand that value proposition. Or, in the case of something like underwriting -- something we've been doing for quite a while -- we have multiple tests [of AI tools] against our underwriting to make sure that we're getting valid results.

When you saw generative AI for the first time, did you immediately see use cases?

Bastian: I enjoy technology overall. I just love to understand how things work. My first thought was, ""Okay, I need to understand more about how this is coming together.""

After understanding about LLMs [large language models] and RAG [retrieval augmented generation] and all the other technical details that go into it, I started to think about how this can apply itself to the insurance, annuity and advisor spaces. Everything that we've come up with focuses on a human in the loop, just because of how GenAI is structured. It's important for us to make sure that we still have humans thinking about what is happening. We are a company that generates a lot of documentation. We want to ensure that we get the right policy, contract and type of products out there in production. It necessitates a lot of information, and GenAI can help pull that information together. Many of our use cases are set up around that.

What are examples of operational use cases?

Bastian: We have a use case for group insurance claims. They're different based on each company's contract and the company's state regulations. So if I'm on the phone with a customer, I have to go out to different places to pull that information together. With what we've done with GenAI, we know who the customer is, we know what company they work for, and we know what state they're coming from. We gather all that information so that, instead of trying to find different documents, CSRs [customer service representatives] can focus on the customer and be very empathetic.

We also have another use case for advisors. It pulls together information about who they're meeting. We have wholesalers [who support financial advisors] as well as advisors. In the wholesaler space, we're pulling together information about the people they're meeting with so that they can come well prepared. That makes them a lot more productive.

Do you employ multiple LLMs for different functions, or are you a one-LLM shop?

Bastian: We are not a one-LLM shop. Different LLMs are optimized for different things. We give a lot of thought to what the right LLM is for the job. We also give thought to how we're going to apply it; what is the right risk for our customers, stakeholders, advisors, whomever else. So we're very protective how we're using LLMs, which ones we're using and which ones are the best for any given use case.

What are you doing with Salesforce agents and Financial Services Cloud?

Bastian: They have done some great things in our wholesaler space, as mentioned above. We consolidated our customer service across all our businesses onto Salesforce. We consolidated all our claims -- except for disability claims -- onto Salesforce. Our retirement business, our U.S. life insurance business, group insurance business and everything is on Salesforce.

On the sales side, we're using agentic AI to help with call logging. If a CSR meets with a customer or a wholesaler meets with an advisor, it logs what happened during that meeting. The agents can go off and deal with follow-ups. Agentic is great at summarizing how we met with [an advisor], how they want to do these types of cases in the future and what follow-ups are needed, then it will set those up in Salesforce and deal with those background pieces. We think we can save at least half a day per week, just on different follow-ups and setting up other things in Salesforce. So that's a great use case beta that we're starting.

On the service side, there's a lot that goes on after a call. When a customer calls up and has a service request, there are a bunch of other things, different follow-ups, different background things that happen with administration systems and others. We're in a beta there where an agent can do some of those things. [This allows] the CSR to get on the next call and be more empathetic to the conversation that they're having -- as opposed to having to think about the call log, follow-ups or the things that they have to do in the background. This agentic force helps us get through many of the background [tasks] so that our advisors or CSRs can stay focused on the customer.

What advice do you have for your peers experimenting with or evaluating agentic AI?

Bastian: One thing is to keep customers at the heart. How do you make your CSRs better with the customer? How do you make them more empathetic? How do you make it a great relationship, so when a client calls up Prudential, they feel like the agent is listening to them? Design your agents keeping in mind how to enable better interactions.

The other thing, especially for our industry -- whether it be bank, financial services or asset management -- is that we're regulated, so you've got to think that through first. Don't go off and create a bunch of agents that do a bunch of things that could get you into trouble. Think through the governance before you get down the path of thinking about agentic.

If you focus on a customer at the heart of it and you really balance yourself with governance and regulatory, that space in the middle that allows the human to do the best that they can when they're on the call or when they're meeting with an advisor. That's the path to greatness on some of this.",https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/money_g1250581414.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:14:23.427426

McDonald’s breakfast traffic has been declining, with many customers opting to skip the meal or eat at home.","Spice meets tradition as McDonald’s revamps its breakfast icon for summer.

The chain is rolling out two seasonal items aimed at capturing morning and midday customers.

Starting July 8, participating US restaurants will debut three Spicy McMuffin options: Egg, Sausage, and Sausage with Egg.

This launch coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, which has remained a morning staple since its nationwide rollout in 1975.

In its latest ""USA Menu Spotter,"" McDonald’s described the new item as a spicy update to a classic AM offering.

""This limited-time glow-up includes everything you already love about the iconic Egg McMuffin sandwich—melty cheese, a freshly cracked egg (now sourced 100% cage-free in the U.S.), Canadian bacon and a perfectly toasted and buttered English Muffin—plus a fiery, delicious twist: a shot of McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce.""

McDonald’s confirmed that the new Spicy McMuffin lineup features the same ingredients customers recognize: cheese, freshly cracked eggs from 100% cage-free sources in the US, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a toasted English muffin.

Each sandwich includes McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce, previously seen only on its lunch offerings, now applied to morning meal for the first time.

Sweet Spot for Seasonal Sales

The fast-food giant also quietly brought back its Blueberry & Crème Pie on June 30.

Served warm, the seasonal dessert features a dual filling of sweet blueberries and vanilla-flavored crème inside a flaky crust.

It’s currently available at locations nationwide while supplies last.

While McDonald’s has not confirmed end dates for either item, the short-term availability encourages quick customer trial.

The timing also aligns with peak summer travel and holiday dining, where morning meals and quick-service desserts often see increased demand.

For brand leaders and marketers, this signals a clear seasonal approach: refresh core products with small ingredient updates that can create marketing momentum without changing operations.

McDonald’s continues to maintain menu familiarity while offering just enough novelty to create interest.

This is especially important across morning menu, where competition for traffic remains high.

Recent earnings reports also reveal deeper business implications.

McDonald’s breakfast traffic has been declining, with many customers opting to skip the meal or eat at home.

The financial backdrop adds urgency to McDonald’s latest menu moves.

In Q1 2025, the company reported a 3% drop in both net income and revenue compared to the same period last year, with global comparable sales also declining 1%.

These figures highlight the need for initiatives that can bring back traffic without requiring heavy investment.

Exclusive run breakfast and dessert items are one way to address that.

CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that this drop reflects economic pressures, not competitive losses.

“Morning now is a place that you’re seeing people who are choosing either to skip breakfast or they’re choosing to eat at home,”

In that context, the Spicy McMuffin isn’t just a seasonal offering.

It’s a calculated effort to re-engage customers while keeping operations consistent.

Our Take: Does This Limited Breakfast Drop Really Matter?

It does, and here’s why I see it as a smart move.

Early-day lineup has long been a high-margin, underleveraged part of quick-service, but momentum in the category has slowed.

Spicy McMuffins give McDonald’s a way to re-engage regulars without overcomplicating prep or ingredients.

Adding flavor variety to a familiar item invites repeat visits and keeps marketing teams talking without putting strain on operations.

It’s a practical update that supports both sales goals and brand consistency.

74434, Dec. 30, 2021) and “Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles” (89 Fed.","H.R. 1, President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” primarily targets EV funding but also takes aim at clean diesel emissions efforts. Section 42104 repeals the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program (DERA), Section 60104 of Public Law 117–169 (the Inflation Reduction Act). This EPA program helped fleets pay for the retrofitting or replacement of older diesel trucks. Because many state programs rely on DERA funding, this repeal could trigger ripple effects on local emissions compliance incentives.

Additionally, the bill rescinds Inflation Reduction Act funding originally intended to reduce emissions near freight corridors, schools, and ports (Sections 42105–42108). Without these resources, efforts to mitigate localized pollution from diesel traffic may fall short, putting more pressure on municipalities—and ultimately, fleets.

Regulatory Rollbacks for Diesel Emissions Standards

Perhaps most consequential for future truck development, Section 42201 repeals greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emission standards issued by the EPA. These rules included long-term limits targeting 2027-plus model year heavy-duty engines, particularly NOx and particulate matter. While repeal could offer near-term regulatory relief for manufacturers and fleets, it also introduces uncertainty for companies that have already invested in technology to meet the upcoming standards.

The section states:

The final rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to “Revised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards” (86 Fed. Reg. 74434, Dec. 30, 2021) and “Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles” (89 Fed. Reg. 27842, April 18, 2024) shall have no force or effect.

Additionally, Section 42301 repealed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rules relating to CAFE Standards, stating:

The final rules issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration relating to “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years 2024–2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks” (87 Fed. Reg. 25710, May 2, 2022) and “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond” (89 Fed. Reg. 52540, June 24, 2024) shall have no force or effect.

Let’s be clear here: That rule does not apply to heavy-duty Class 7–8 trucks. It applies to:

• Light-duty vehicles

• Medium-duty vehicles, including some commercial diesels (Class 2b–6).

EPA’s Phase 3 GHG rule for heavy-duty trucks, which covers 2027–2032 model years, is a different rule published separately. At this time, H.R. 1 does not explicitly repeal EPA’s heavy-duty GHG Phase 3 rules, but it does grant itself broad authority to roll back climate and emissions regulations elsewhere in the bill.

As a reminder, EPA’s Phase 3 rule was finalized in March 2024. It covers heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7–8) and model years 2027 through 2032, and it sets both carbon-dioxide and pollutant standards for long-haul tractors and vocational vehicles.

Fewer Reporting Requirements

Also worth noting is Section 42111, which repeals funding for corporate greenhouse gas reporting. While this doesn’t directly change emissions requirements, it could relieve some of the compliance pressure on large fleets who were beginning to measure and disclose carbon outputs.",https://s18391.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Volvo-Engine-Service1-1400.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:15:54.161272

Along the way, Decathlon sets more achievable goals, starting with the classics in general and the Paris-Roubaix, the classic at home.
A first objective for which the French team is already reinforcing by incorporating experienced cyclists like Olav Kooij and Tiesj Benoot for 2026.","The 40 years that a Frenchman has been waiting, since Bernard Hinault did it in 1985, the Tour de France is a great wound to the pride of this country that Decathlon wants to solve with a medium-term commitment that begins with the renovation of its structures that has just been announced.

AG2R-La Mondiale leaves sponsorship after 28 years in the peloton and hands over to Decathlon

The transition in the veteran AG2R team is consolidated, a paradigm shift that began with Decathlon's sponsorship last year. Now, the French sports multinational remains solely in charge of the cycling team with a clear intention, to increase its contribution and strengthen it to bring it to the highest level. All with a clear objective, to bring French cycling back to the forefront, including the assault on the yellow jersey of the Tour de France.

A growth process that, obviously, begins with the search for a secondary sponsor with the intention of having a budget of more than 40 million euros for the next season, a significant increase considering that this year they had 28 million.

However, it does not seem to be a problem as indicated by the words of team director Dominique Serieys who pointed out that negotiations with the new sponsor are very advanced ""We trust that we can announce the name before the end of the Tour de France"" while being clear about the trajectory they intend to follow ""Our goal is to enter the Top 5 and then the Top 3 in the world and win the Tour de France by 2030"".

Decathlon's bet to achieve this milestone seems to fall on young Paul Seixas who, at 18 years old, is completing his first season as a professional in the French team after coming from the development team. In his debut season, he has left good impressions after several honorable positions in the Tour of the Alps or the 8th place he occupied in the general classification of the Critérium du Dauphiné.

Dominique Serieys is clear about it ""When he was a junior, I met him at his parents' house; I spent a whole afternoon there. He was the only one who told me that his ambition was to win the Tour de France"". A bet on young cyclists that is more of an obligation than a choice ""all the great leaders have contracts until 2030, not to mention the value of their contracts. Our job is to identify and train"".

Boston Scientific has raised the bar - by winning FDA approval for Farapulse PFA to be used in the treatment of drug refractory, symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), an arrythmia in which the heart beats abnormally for at least seven days.

The Marlborough, MA-based company said FDA approval for expanded labeling was supported by clinical evidence from phase one of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial.

Results were presented at AF Symposium 2025 and recently published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and met both the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints. In the prospective, single-arm trial, 260 patients who were drug intolerant to at least one Class I/III anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) were enrolled at 43 global sites.

""We look forward to studying the system in new clinical trials, including patients in need of re-do ablations and those with more complex arrhythmias, which account for a large portion of the procedures today still using thermal ablation.""

The company said it anticipates CE mark and approval in China and Japan in the coming months.

The expanded approval follows two firms raising about $285 million in the PFA space. Field Medical closed an oversubscribed $35 million in a series B round. In June, Kardium announced it raised about $250 million.

Cheaper compounded drugs are still being sold Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs.
That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.
Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.
She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.","Prices are falling for the popular obesity treatments Wegovy and Zepbound, but steady access to the drugs remains challenging.

The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance — out of reach for many patients. And even for people with insurance, coverage remains uneven.

“The medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,” said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.

Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there’s hope that prices may fall more in the future.

The drugs are still in high demand

Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.

Zepbound brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year’s first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly’s best sellers.

Novo Nordisk says Wegovy has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.

Insurance coverage is increasing — for some

The benefits consultant Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.

And Novo says 85% of its patients who have coverage in the U.S. pay $25 or less per month.

Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro from Novo and Lilly that are approved to treat that condition.

But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don’t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.

Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.

Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.

“Coverage is not the same as access,” said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.

But coverage remains inconsistent

Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.

Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.

One of the nation’s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.

That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.

Dr. Courtney Younglove’s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer’s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.

“Then some of them just cancel their appointment because they don’t have coverage,” the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.

Cheaper compounded drugs are still being sold

Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined earlier this year that the shortage had ended.

That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.

The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.

It’s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.

Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.

Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.

Prices have dropped

Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.

Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.

There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.

Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.

She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.

“I think price wars are going to drive it down,” she said. “I think we are in the early stages. I have hope.”

The union letter shared that a fully recommended tentative agreement had been reached with Safeway/Albertsons, bringing picket lines down and allowing workers to prepare for their return. The strike, which began in mid June, expanded to include more than 45 stores statewide and lasted for nearly three weeks.

According to a UFCW Local 7 Facebook post on Saturday, July 5, striking workers were not required to report to work until Monday, July 7, but could contact their store director if they wanted to return earlier. All employees who participated in picketing for at least one day last week and have not yet received their full strike benefit will be paid for an eight-hour day on July 5.

The letter stated, “The provisions of the all gains, no concessions agreements include 45 tentative agreements.” There will be fully funded healthcare benefits and improvements to dental and vision coverage. Workers will now receive double the lens allowance for vision care and an increase in life insurance benefits under the healthcare plan.

Retiree healthcare remains protected, with no cuts or changes and fully funded pension benefits are secure for another contract cycle. The agreement also states that healthcare contributions will be made for striking employees who didn’t work enough hours in June or July to qualify for coverage, to qualify for health coverage.

The deal includes “strong” wage increases and a longevity bonus for associates with at least one year of service, the letter states. Attendance points will be fully reset, and employees will have access to expanded vacation cash out options. The agreement also introduces a test-and-learn trial designed to study meaningful staffing improvements in stores.

While Rybrevant is an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, Zegfrovy is a first-in-class selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
Since the FDA signed off on Zegfrovy last week, Dizal’s share price has increased by 10%.
Supporting the FDA approval of Zagfrovy is the WU-KONG1B trial, which showed the treatment shrunk tumors in 46% of patients and provided an 11.1-month median duration of response.
Dizal has completed enrollment in the study which will evaluate Zagfrovy versus chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients in 16 countries.","Eight years after it was established partly by AstraZeneca, Dizal Pharmaceuticals has gained its first FDA approval, winning an accelerated nod for Zegfrovy (sunvozertinib) to become the only U.S.-endorsed oral treatment for those with a rare type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients in the U.S. with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose cancer has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy are now eligible for Zegfrovy.

The blessing comes 16 months after the FDA signed off on Johnson & Johnson’s infused Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in the indication. While Rybrevant is an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, Zegfrovy is a first-in-class selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

“(Zegfrovy) offers a more effective treatment option with enhanced safety and ease of administration for NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions,” Dizal CEO Xiaolin Zhang, Ph.D., said in a release.

Zhang, who served at AstraZeneca for 20 years before taking the reins at Dizal, told Fierce Pharma last year that he was in discussions with multiple drugmakers who were interested in partnering with the Shanghai-based company on Zagfrovy. Dizal already commercializes the drug in China, where it was approved in August of 2023.

Since the FDA signed off on Zegfrovy last week, Dizal’s share price has increased by 10%.

Dizal will try to succeed where another oral EGFR inhibitor failed in the indication. Takeda’s Exkivity, which received an accelerated FDA approval for second-line use in 2021, was withdrawn from the U.S. market two years later after it failed to beat out chemotherapy in a confirmatory trial.

Supporting the FDA approval of Zagfrovy is the WU-KONG1B trial, which showed the treatment shrunk tumors in 46% of patients and provided an 11.1-month median duration of response.

These figures compare to a 40% objective response rate (ORR) and an 11.1-month median duration response, which backed the accelerated nod for Rybrevant in 2021. Meanwhile, the trial supporting conditional approval of Exkivity showed a 28% ORR.

Additionally, in WU-KONG1B, Zagfrovy showed an anti-tumor effect regardless of prior treatment with Rybrevant. The WU-KONG1B trial enrolled patients in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

“Findings from WU-KONG1B have demonstrated Zegfrovy's significant therapeutic effects with consistent efficacy across both Asian and non-Asian patient populations,” Pasi Jänne, M.D., Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School and the lead principal investigator, said in the release. “Its convenient once-daily oral dosing substantially improves administration convenience and patient adherence, which is an increasingly critical factor as lung cancer care shifts toward chronic disease management.”

Along with the approval, the FDA simultaneously signed off on Thermo Fisher’s Oncomine Dx Express Test as a companion diagnostic to identify patients with EGFR Exon 20 insertions.

Roughly 2% of NSCLC patients have the genetic type, though it is the third most common type of EGFR mutation.

Treating this type of NSCLC is “particularly challenging” because of its “unique spatial conformation, diverse mutation subtypes, and high heterogeneity,” according to Mengzhao Wang, M.D., Ph.D., the principal investigator of the WU-KONG1B study. “As a result, patients face a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.”

As for the progression of Zagfrovy, much will depend on its multinational phase 3 WU-KONG28 trial. Dizal has completed enrollment in the study which will evaluate Zagfrovy versus chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients in 16 countries.

At the 2023 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference, Dizal reported that Zegfrovy as a solo treatment in the first-line setting achieved an ORR of 79% and a median progression-free survival of 12.4 months.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercepharma/1644327351/greenlight.jpg/greenlight.jpg?VersionId=LhMxhJMPbJ2t8xpkYyIRznMdcYZPYi7U,N,,2025-07-07 12:14:12.866992

The company's Q2 2025 results mark a pivotal moment for its $36 billion MedTech business, which accounts for 36% of total revenue. Despite challenges in China and tariff pressures, JNJ is positioned to accelerate growth in the second half of the year, fueled by strategic acquisitions and a robust pipeline. Here's why investors should consider this stock as a “Buy.”

Asia Pacific Struggles: China's VBP Program and No Near-Term Relief

The MedTech segment's performance in Asia Pacific, particularly China, remains a drag. The government's volume-based procurement (VBP) program—a cost-containment initiative—has slashed sales volumes and prices for medical devices. Anticorruption campaigns have further stifled demand. J&J has explicitly stated it expects no improvement in China's market conditions in 2025 as the VBP program expands to more provinces and product categories.

While Asia Pacific accounts for roughly 30% of MedTech sales, the segment's outlook in this region is grim. Competitors like Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are also grappling with these pressures, but J&J's exposure to China's MedTech market makes it particularly vulnerable.

U.S. Innovation: Growth Engine for MedTech's Turnaround

The U.S. market is where JNJ's MedTech strategy is paying off. Key drivers include:

1. Acquisitions: Newly acquired businesses like Abiomed (cardiovascular solutions) and Shockwave (vascular therapies) contributed significantly to Q1's 4.1% operational sales growth. These firms are now integral to JNJ's cardiovascular portfolio.

2. Electrophysiology Momentum: Despite competitive pressures from rivals like Abbott (ABT) and Boston Scientific in PFA ablation catheters, JNJ is advancing its VARIPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation Platform (approved in early 2025). While sales dipped in Q1 due to one-time orthopedic issues, this segment is expected to rebound as the VARIPULSE gains traction post-U.S. regulatory reviews.

3. Robotic Surgery: The OTTAVA system, a next-gen robotic surgical platform, is on track for FDA approval in 2026. Early trials suggest it could disrupt the $5 billion robotic surgery market dominated by Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).

The U.S. MedTech market grew 5.1% operationally in Q1, driven by cardiovascular and general surgery products. With fewer one-time disruptions in Q2, this momentum is poised to accelerate.

Second-Half Acceleration: Easing Comparisons and New Product Lift

JNJ's guidance points to stronger MedTech performance in the second half of 2025. Key catalysts include:

- Easing Comparisons: The first quarter faced tougher year-over-year comparisons, but Q2 and beyond should see easier benchmarks.

- Pipeline Execution: The OTTAVA system's FDA approval timeline and expanded use of Shockwave's lithoplasty technology in peripheral artery disease (PAD) will drive growth.

- Global Diversification: While China's issues persist, markets like Europe and Japan are stable, offsetting regional risks.

Management also highlighted that tariff-related costs, though a near-term profit headwind, are factored into full-year guidance. The company's adjusted EPS is expected to grow 6.2% in 2025, with the MedTech segment's operational sales forecasted to expand 2.5%–3.5%.

Valuation and Zacks Metrics: Undervalued with a Strong Buy Signal

JNJ's shares are trading at a forward P/E of 14.43, below both the industry average (14.99) and its five-year historical mean (15.73). The stock has outperformed the sector YTD, rising 9.7% versus a 0.6% decline for healthcare peers.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS is $10.62, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Analyst upgrades and a robust dividend yield of 2.3% further bolster its appeal.

Investment Thesis: Buy on Undervaluation and Turnaround Potential

JNJ's MedTech segment is transitioning from a China-dependent model to one fueled by U.S. innovation and diversification. The second-half acceleration narrative, supported by new products and easing comparisons, justifies a “Buy” stance. Key risks include:

- Tariff Costs: Could compress margins unless offset by pricing power.

- Regulatory Delays: The OTTAVA system's FDA timeline is critical.

However, the stock's valuation discount and Zacks' bullish rating suggest the market underestimates JNJ's ability to navigate these challenges. Investors seeking a resilient, dividend-paying stock with growth catalysts should consider JNJ a top pick in the MedTech space.

Actionable Takeaway: Accumulate JNJ shares on dips below $175, with a 12-month price target of $195–$200.

While some drivers remain satisfied and willing to pay for features like navigation and infotainment, adoption rates are declining due to pricing, privacy, and subscription fatigue. OEMs are under pressure to improve transparency, user experience, and affordability as they expand digital offerings to boost post-sale revenue.

Here’s why it matters:

Dealers play a critical role in introducing connected services to consumers, often during the vehicle delivery process. As OEMs seek to monetize post-sale subscriptions, dealers are expected to facilitate activations and promote services. However, declining interest and rising skepticism make this a harder sell. Dealers must be prepared to address consumer concerns about data privacy, long-term costs, and usability if they are to help OEMs succeed in building recurring revenue streams through connected technologies.

Key takeaways:

Willingness to pay is declining

The percentage of consumers willing to pay for connected car services decreased from 86% in 2024 to 68% in 2025, primarily due to concerns about cost and value.

Data privacy remains a major barrier

Consumers are growing increasingly concerned about how their data is collected, stored, and utilized, particularly as automakers expand their monetization efforts.

Fewer buyers know about connected features

A fifth of non-subscribers say they were never offered or made aware of connected car services, highlighting a communication gap at the point of sale.

Subscription fatigue is setting in

Buyers are frustrated by recurring fees, fragmented service tiers, and hardware-based features that require separate payments to activate.

Opportunity still exists with satisfied users

Among consumers who use connected services, satisfaction and word-of-mouth remain strong, especially in navigation and infotainment categories.

As OEMs roll out more connected service offerings, dealers should prioritize education, simplify onboarding, and clearly explain long-term value to retain interest and build customer trust.

Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson’s Abiomed has recalled automated controllers for its Impella heart pumps over a fault linked to three deaths, the Food and Drug Administration said last week.

Abiomed’s controllers can fail to detect a pump when connected. No visual alarm is triggered by the fault, which can lead to inadequate hemodynamic support that puts patients at risk.

The FDA released an early alert about a week after Abiomed contacted customers because the fault is a potentially high-risk issue. Abiomed has advised users on how to mitigate the risk.

Dive Insight:

Healthcare professionals use the Impella pump to provide temporary full or partial heart support. The device pumps part or all of the patient’s blood circulation during certain procedures or when a person’s heart needs time to recover from an acute condition.

Abiomed provides an automated Impella controller with the heart pumps. The device is the primary user control interface for Impella pumps. Information about the use of the pump, including error messages when needed, are shown on the controller’s screen.

The company has identified two situations in which the controller may fail to detect the Impella pump when connected. During a console-to-console transfer, the controller can freeze on a screen that tells users to anticoagulate once the sheath is in place.

Abiomed has asked users to check if the screen freezes for more than 20 seconds and does not advance after connecting the pump to the transferred console. If that happens, users should immediately switch the pump to the previous console to restore support to the patient. Abiomed has advised users to switch to a different console if the previous console displays an alarm message.

The other fault happens during the case start process, when the screen can freeze on information about connecting up the controller. Abiomed has asked users to switch the pump to a different console if the screen freezes for more than 20 seconds after connecting the pump and does not progress to indicate “Detecting Impella.”

To mitigate the risks, the company has told users to have a back-up controller available. Abiomed said device failure is unlikely. The FDA is yet to classify the recall but has published an early alert, which the agency reserves for potentially high-risk issues.

When FDA classifies the recall, the affected controllers will add to the list of 46 products that Abiomed has recalled since being acquired by J&J in December 2022.

The run of post-takeover regulatory actions began in April 2023 with a Class I recall that was triggered by complaints that purge fluid had leaked from the purge sidearm of the pump.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nzcbnYrvivroHpNaclT3RVM4JE8nuguAMWN7D44-NQU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BYmlvbWVkX2hlYXJ0X3B1bXBfcmVzaXplZC5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-07-07 12:14:20.624854

The deal may trigger a new consolidation in the tech industry, he said.
According to tech industry observers, Capgemini, with WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points.
In some cases like procurement services, Capgemini acquires a well-established strategic sourcing capability built on WNS’s 2017 Denali acquisition, strengthening Capgemini’s F&A and procurement capabilities.
Earlier in the day, Capgemini and WNS had entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which Capgemini would acquire WNS for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.","Capgemini, the Paris-based technology and digital transformation major, made the Big 4 – Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG – sit up globally on Monday with its announcement of buying the India-grown business process management firm WNS for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion, said global analysts.

“This acquisition will give Capgemini a new positioning in the global tech market against the Big 4 comprising Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG, which have traditionally dominated the consulting and technology services,” Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research, a Cambridge-based analyst firm told The Hindu.

Mr. Fersht said, from a competitive perspective, a potential big win for Capgemini was its new positioning against the Big 4, which have traditionally dominated consulting and technology services.

“With Capgemini’s global scale and depth of technical capabilities, the addition of WNS could create an ideal incubation business to develop leading-edge Services-as-Software solutions to attack this huge $1.5 trillion emerging marketing opportunity,” Mr. Fersht said.

“The long-rumoured acquisition of WNS is finally here. Capgemini is returning to its acquisition lead growth model and acting as a major force in industry consolidation.,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and executive chairman of Dallas-based Everest Group.

According to the Everest Group’s chief, Capgemini is betting that the WNS book of business will provide a fertile ground for AI-driven transformation and allow it to develop new transformative AI-powered platforms. “The potential is clearly there, but the journey will require significant additional investment and a resolute leadership team,” Mr Bendor-Samuel cautioned.

The deal may trigger a new consolidation in the tech industry, he said.

Mr. Bendor-Samuel said BPO (BPM) as a space has held up well in a world rocked by AI which has yet to have a significant impact on the space. “However, this deal could be the start of a significant industry consolidation,” he opined.

“This may well kick off another round of industry consolidation as the large strategics look to grow inorganically and prepare for the massive changes that AI is starting to bring,” he forecast.

According to tech industry observers, Capgemini, with WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points.

In some cases like procurement services, Capgemini acquires a well-established strategic sourcing capability built on WNS’s 2017 Denali acquisition, strengthening Capgemini’s F&A and procurement capabilities. Also, WNS’s North American and U.K.-centric client base allows Capgemini to expand its geographic footprint.

To a firm like Capgemini, Mr. Fersht further said, WNS’s client base was a gold mine of sales opportunities where its client operations executives could easily explore to replace BPO services with Services-as-Software. “Further, WNS’s deep domain expertise, the cornerstone of its client growth rate, provides Capgemini, which has historically lagged behind other companies in terms of domain-specific operational BPO delivery,” he added.

Earlier in the day, Capgemini and WNS had entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which Capgemini would acquire WNS for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.

The French tech major said it would US-listed WNS for a cash consideration of $76.50 per WNS share, which represents a premium of 28% to the last 90-day average share price, of 27% to the last 30-day average share price and a premium of 17% to the last closing share price on July 3, 2025.

The transaction would be accretive to Capgemini’s normalised EPS by 4% before synergies in 2026 and 7% post synergies in 2027, it said. “Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,” said Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini.

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS said, “Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy.”

In sum – what to know:

AI operations – new Danone AI academy in Poland aims to upskill 20,000 factory staff in AI by 2026.

Industry 5.0 – push includes AI-driven decision-making, digital twins, and a 10-site innovation network

Digital change – ongoing Renew Danone strategy ties digital training to productivity and sustainability.

French food and beverage manufacturer Danone has opened a so-called ‘Industry 5.0 Academy’ to train 20,000 operational staff in digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI) by next year (2026). The academy is part of its digital manufacturing strategy, geared to improve the productivity, sustainability, resilience, and flexibility of its global operations. Danone has 183 production sites around the world; the new academy cohort will be taken from all.

The new facility is located at the company’s Nutricia factory in Opole, in southern Poland. (The Nutricia brand specialises in therapeutic food and infant formula.) The site in Opole is listed as one of the World Economic Forum’s ‘global digital lighthouse’ venues. Training will cover advanced automation, AI prompt writing, and data-enabled decision-making; modules will be delivered in person and online.

Indeed, the Paris-based firm has a burgeoning reputation as a digital progressive. It is using AI – or data analytics and machine learning, marketed as AI – variously for predictive maintenance (“smart sensors detect vibrations and temperature changes to anticipate machine issues before they occur”), generative AI agents (“AI assistants analyse production line data”), ‘AI decision-making’ (“to optimise processes, such as spray drying in baby formula production”), and digital twins (“AI powered simulations… to test new recipes and production scenarios virtually”).

It will also create a “new network of 10 pioneering factories” to pilot disruptive smart manufacturing (“digital factory of the future”) models, it said. “The academy is just the beginning,” said Vikram Agarwal, chief operations officer at the firm. “Our ambition is to set new industry standards for human-machine collaboration, so we can better service our customers, consumers, and patients around the world.”

A year ago, Danone signed with US software giant Microsoft to “explore” a multi-year collaboration to integrate AI throughout its operations. It said at the time, the pair would launch a ‘Danone Microsoft AI Academy’, dedicated to upskilling all Danone employees to ensure that all Danoners are equipped with the AI and digital tools they need to thrive in the new AI-driven economy. Presumably, the new academy is the upshot, in some fashion.

There was no reference to Microsoft in the latest release. But the original remit, from a year ago, talked about upskilling or reskilling around 100,000 Danone employees “to the jobs of the future”, as well as attracting new AI talent. The duo talk about AI solutions and use cases for “all of Danone’s functions”, as well as for an “AI-enabled supply chain”. As many as 50,000 staff are already in position to leverage AI in their day-to-day work, they said – with Microsoft Copilot, and suchlike.

Danone employs around 90,000 people, and sells products in around 120 markets. Its 2024 sales revenue was €27.4 billion. Its brands include Actimel, Activia, Alpro, Aptamil, Danette, Danio, Evian, Nutricia, Nutrilon, and Volvic.

Vikram Agarwal, chief operations officer at Danone, said of the new initiative: “The global manufacturing sector faces a significant shortfall of skilled workers. It’s a commercial imperative for us to train existing talent… to be active participants in Industry 5.0. Technologies like AI and robotics are already reshaping how we operate – but their true potential lies in the hands of our people. The [academy] is about how we bring that vision to life… Our ambition is to set new industry standards for human-machine collaboration.”

It’s a key pillar of our Renew Danone strategy and will create long-term value for all our stakeholders.

Meanwhile, Danone is investing in a Digital Lab (D-Lab) in Singapore, focused on ‘digital science, data analytics, and AI-driven health solutions’. Danone has a partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), with a joint initiative around ‘digital health’ since 2018. Danone’s research and innovation network spans multiple continents, anchored by flagship centres in Paris, France, and Utrecht, Netherlands.

It has a concerted co-innovation programme with partners, with a whole bunch of strategic agreements (19, as of September) and joint business development plans (eight) across ingredients, packaging, manufacturing, agriculture, and indirect suppliers. It said it wanted to double its number of partnerships over the next two years, as part of this Partner for Growth (P4G) scheme.

Like the new academy, and its tyre-kicking on AI with Microsoft, its partner programme is part of its so-called Renew Danone strategy, which is based around “science and technology, precision capacity creation, cost competitiveness and sustainability”. New digital technologies and techniques are a core part of the whole plan – to enable its staff to bring higher efficiency, productivity, and sustainability to its operations, as it repeatedly notes.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/danone.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:15:38.795896

In the MedTech segment, newly acquired cardiovascular businesses, Abiomed and Shockwave, as well as continued uptake of its new products, are likely to have driven growth in the second quarter. However, sales in J&J’s MedTech business continue to face headwinds in the Asia Pacific, particularly in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program and the anticorruption campaign. VBP is a government-driven cost-containment effort in China. J&J does not expect any improvement in its business in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, in 2025. JNJ expects continued impacts from VBP issues in China in 2025 as the program expands across provinces and products.

Competitive pressure is also expected to continue to hurt growth in some MedTech businesses, such as PFA ablation catheters in U.S. electrophysiology. In the first quarter, MedTech sales were hurt by several one-time events, mainly impacting orthopedics. This one-time impact is not likely to have hurt sales in the second quarter.

Nonetheless, sales are expected to be higher in the second half of 2025 than in the first half as the business moves past tougher first-quarter comps and new products gain momentum throughout 2025. However, tariff-related costs are expected to hurt profits in the MedTech segment

J&J’s Key Competitors in the Medical Devices Market

J&J’s MedTech unit faces strong competition from several major players in the medical device industry like Medtronic MDT, Abbott, Stryker SYK and Boston Scientific BSX.

While Medtronic has a strong presence in cardiovascular, neuroscience and surgical technologies, Stryker is a global leader in medical technology, specializing in innovative solutions across surgical, neurotechnology, orthopedics and spine care. Boston Scientific markets products for cardiovascular, endoscopy, urology and neuromodulation. Abbott is known for its medical device products across cardiovascular, diagnostics, and diabetes care.

JNJ’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates

J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has risen 9.7% in the year-to-date period compared with a 0.6% increase of the industry.

From a valuation standpoint, J&J is reasonably priced. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 14.43 forward earnings, lower than 14.99 for the industry. The stock is also trading below its five-year mean of 15.73.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $10.60 per share to $10.62 per share for 2025 and from $10.98 per share to $11.00 per share over the past 30 days.

In a recent Reddit thread, one user noted that this McDonald's dining room, located on Third Avenue, has been made ""inaccessible for guests."" Apparently, this change occurred a few years ago, with customers noting that the location is not necessarily in a safe area.

""That's the sketchiest corner in the entire Seattle Metropolitan Area,"" one customer wrote. Another social media user agreed, writing, ""It's a safety thing. Locations with a violence and/or drug problem. The handful of people who go in there to cause problems, ruin it for everyone.""

A second Reddit thread user who worked at the location for four years described it as a ""cultural hub,"" and ""amazing,"" but not without its pitfalls. ""I was fascinated by this location,"" the former employee wrote. ""Every day I was learning how to calm the chaos.""

McDonald's had originally rid itself of dining rooms in mid-March 2020 amid the COVID-19 guidelines, National Restaurant News reported. By 2022, dining rooms had largely re-opened, but certain locations, like Seattle's, are just order-by-window restaurants due to possible staffing shortages, safety concerns, and overall efficiency. With the franchise being independently owned, available dining rooms are up to the discretion of the location owner.

""That's probably the corporate dream,"" one customer said. ""The remodels already have few employees and drinks behind the counter.""

McDonald's to find 'restaurant gaps' across Australia, open dozens of new stores

In an interview with local news outlets, McDonald's Australia CEO Joe Chiczewski said the chain plans to open between 30 and 50 new locations across the country by the end of 2026.

""We’re going to open more restaurants over the next 12 months,” Chiczewski told News.com.au, adding that the goal is to find ""restaurant gaps"" in different parts of the country. ""That is a key priority for our growth strategy. Not just the next 12 months, but over the next few years.""

Chiczewski added that the chain is setting its sights on Perth in the western part of the country and framed it as ""continuing to invest in the Aussie community.""

At the start of July, McDonald's Australia announced that it will lock in the prices of certain meal deals and items on its Loose Change Menu at a respective $7 ($4.55 USD) and $4 ($2.60 USD), as many customers expressed concerns with the rising cost of living.

In announcing the upcoming openings, Chiczewski also said the higher demand is fueled by customers choosing to forgo traditional restaurants due to expense.

""My commitment to Australian customers is clear: 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, you can count on us for great value at Macca's,"" he said further.

ID4,ArcelorMittal,2025-07-07 15:10:13+00:00,Citinewsroom - Comprehensive News in Ghana,ArcelorMittal unveils $1.8B Iron Ore facility in Liberia - CitiNewsroom.com,Citi Newsroom,,,,,https://citinewsroom.com/2025/07/arcelormittal-unveils-1-8b-iron-ore-facility-in-liberia/,"ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel producer, has officially opened a cutting-edge iron ore concentrator at the Tokadeh mine in northern Liberia, marking a defining moment in the country’s post-war economic transformation.
The new concentrator is engineered to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade iron ore into a high-grade product, adding substantial value before export.
By processing the ore on African soil, Liberia will ship a higher-value product rather than just raw ore, aligning with broader African goals of industrialization and value addition.
These upgrades mean Liberia’s mining corridor now meets international operational and environmental standards, paving the way for multi-user access and regional integration.
ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and, through this expansion, has supported over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs over its two decades in the country.","ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel producer, has officially opened a cutting-edge iron ore concentrator at the Tokadeh mine in northern Liberia, marking a defining moment in the country’s post-war economic transformation.

The inauguration event, held in Nimba County and attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai alongside ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, showcased one of Africa’s largest iron ore beneficiation plants.

This new concentrator – the first of its kind in West Africa – is the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a US$1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total investment in Liberia to about US$3.5 billion. It is one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war, cementing ArcelorMittal’s role as the nation’s biggest foreign investor.

President Boakai hailed the project as a “turning point” for Liberia’s industrial future, calling it a symbol of the country’s resilience and a vote of confidence in its stability.

The new concentrator is engineered to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade iron ore into a high-grade product, adding substantial value before export. Using advanced beneficiation technology, the plant upgrades raw hematite ore (~35% iron content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate.

This higher-grade concentrate commands a better price on global markets and is in growing demand for efficient, lower-emission steelmaking processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). By processing the ore on African soil, Liberia will ship a higher-value product rather than just raw ore, aligning with broader African goals of industrialization and value addition.

“The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai said at the ceremony. This emphasis on local beneficiation echoes the African Union’s vision for mineral-led industrialization, demonstrating how African countries like Liberia (and by extension Ghana and others) can leverage natural resources to spark homegrown industrial development instead of exporting commodities in their lowest form. ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi Mittal noted that the concentrator will significantly improve product quality and “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” securing the country’s position as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

IArcelorMittal’s expansion has been just as much about building Liberia’s infrastructure as boosting output. Alongside the concentrator, the company has invested heavily in modernizing critical transport and energy facilities. The 243-kilometer railway linking the Tokadeh mines to the coastal port of Buchanan has been completely overhauled, with hundreds of thousands of new sleepers laid, track geometry improved, and new passing loops added to handle long, heavy trains.

These upgrades mean Liberia’s mining corridor now meets international operational and environmental standards, paving the way for multi-user access and regional integration. ArcelorMittal has publicly endorsed an open access policy for the railway, working with the Liberian government on a practical operational framework to allow other mining companies to utilize the rail and port under fair agreements.

This sets the stage for Liberia to serve as a regional minerals hub: iron ore deposits from neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone could potentially be transported via Liberia’s infrastructure in the future, strengthening West African economic integration. “These projects are essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people,” President Boakai noted, underscoring how improved infrastructure will connect Liberia – and West Africa – more deeply to international trade networks.

The scale of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II expansion has delivered an immediate boon in employment and training opportunities for Liberians. During the construction of the concentrator and associated infrastructure, over 5,000 jobs were created on site, the majority filled by Liberian workers.

Now that the plant is operational, it is expected to generate roughly 1,000 permanent new jobs in mining, processing, rail operations, and port logistics. “This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” President Boakai said, highlighting the tangible impact on families and communities.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and, through this expansion, has supported over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs over its two decades in the country. In addition to job creation, a strong emphasis has been placed on skill development to ensure Liberians are at the helm of the industry.

The company’s Training Academy in Yekepa has been expanded and modernized, offering a fully funded multi-year technical training program for youth. Dozens of young Liberian engineers and technicians are being trained in disciplines such as mechanical maintenance, electrical systems, heavy equipment operations, and ore processing, gaining the expertise needed to operate the sophisticated new concentrator and related facilities. “I saw young men and women being trained to run this complex facility.

They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai remarked, referring to the new cadre of skilled workers emerging from these programs. This transfer of knowledge and skills is expected to have a long-term multiplier effect, empowering a new generation of Liberian professionals to lead not only in mining, but also to apply their expertise in other sectors.

The expansion has also invigorated local businesses: Liberian contractors were engaged for civil works, trucking, camp services and more, meaning thousands of indirect jobs and a stimulus to local enterprises in Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

As Liberia’s largest taxpayer, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s enlarged operations will contribute increased tax revenues and royalties to the government, enabling greater public investment in development projects across the country.

ArcelorMittal Liberia’s current mining infrastructure has been built with future expansion in mind: the upgraded rail and port can handle up to 30 million tonnes of ore annually, leaving room for a further increase beyond the initial 20 Mt target. In fact, company officials disclosed ambitions for a phased ramp-up to 30 Mt per year and possibly building a pelletizing plant down the line. Such expansions would not only boost output but could also enable more in-country processing (like making direct-reduced iron pellets), which would be a game-changer for West Africa’s role in the global steel supply chain.

The project’s social sustainability is also underlined by ArcelorMittal’s community development commitments. The company contributes about $3 million annually to a community development fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihood programs in local communities.

President Boakai emphasized the importance of this partnership approach, stating that large investments must “enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope” so that communities feel the benefits “not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets”. He urged ArcelorMittal to continue its support for education, healthcare, and small businesses in Liberia, reinforcing that sustainable development should be a mutually beneficial endeavor for both the investor and the nation.

The successful commissioning of this world-class concentrator in Liberia carries broader implications for Africa’s development trajectory. It demonstrates that with a stable investment climate and forward-looking policies, African countries can attract and absorb multibillion-dollar investments in heavy industry.

“We would not have invested this scale of capital of nearly $3 billion if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” ArcelorMittal’s Lakshmi Mittal commented, stressing the company’s long-term confidence in the country.

Such an endorsement from a global industry leader sends a positive signal to international markets about West Africa’s potential as an investment destination. For African governments, the Liberia project highlights the importance of creating a conducive environment for investors while also negotiating agreements that ensure local benefits.

The expansion’s regional integration angle also resonates with continental initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which aims to bolster cross-border infrastructure and industrial supply chains. By developing a mining and transport corridor that could eventually service multiple countries, Liberia is helping lay the groundwork for West African economic corridors that could link mines, power plants, ports, and cities across borders. The project’s focus on value addition and skills transfer aligns with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

It offers a case study to other resource-rich nations – such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Ghana, on how investing in local processing facilities and infrastructure can amplify the economic impact of natural resources. For investors and companies, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s venture underscores the opportunities in Africa’s drive toward industrialization: building mines and plants not only to extract resources, but to refine and export higher-value products and ultimately, finished products. It also shows that strong ESG practices and community engagement can go hand-in-hand with profitability, thereby de-risking large projects.

In sum, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress, a shining example of resilience, ambition, and partnership. Liberia has emerged from the shadows of conflict and crisis to reclaim its place on the global mining map, this time with a focus on sustainable growth and shared prosperity. The nation is now poised to export not just raw materials, but innovation, skills, and a narrative of success.

As the first high-grade iron ore shipments from the concentrator set sail later this year, a powerful message reverberates across the continent: Africa is open for business and ready to lead in transforming its natural wealth into lasting development.",https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ore-.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:14:50.666368

The biggest story? Tariffs, again.

On Wednesday, a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs expires, and President Donald Trump has made it clear: no extensions. Instead, he’s expected to begin sending out letters detailing new tariff rates for trading partners—an announcement he’s teased for 12pm ET on Monday via his Truth Social account.

Markets have taken it in stride—so far. But Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, warns that the calm may not last. “The market remains sanguine about the prospect of tariffs,” she said. “But that raises the risk of a deeper selloff. This is a crucial week for the dozens of countries trying to reach trade agreements with the US.”

In other words, headline risk is back on the table. And this time around, it may be more targeted. Analysts expect tariff impacts to be sector- and region-specific, with autos and metals among the likely focal points. That means risk aversion could hit hardest in countries—like Japan and Canada—that have struggled to make progress in negotiations.

Still, some argue that the broader market may prove resilient. “The macro story remains strong,” Brooks added, pointing to last week’s jobs report showing a still-solid US labor market. That strength is helping prop up confidence, even as investors brace for what could be a bumpy start to the week.

Trade twists and the Fed’s fog

Deutsche Bank analysts echoed a similar tone, noting that while the administration may impose new tariffs on lagging trade partners, a return to “Liberation Day” levels (north of 20%) seems unlikely. Treasury Secretary Bessent has hinted at progress in negotiations, and the Senate’s removal of a contentious “revenge tax” provision from last week’s newly passed budget bill could help reduce friction.

Still, as Swissquote’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya put it, “you can’t count on the tariffs announced in the next few hours staying unchanged for more than a day. That’s just the reality.” And with Trump threatening extra duties for countries aligning with BRICS, the geopolitical drama is unlikely to ease.

Adding to the mix is Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting. The Fed has been sharply divided over whether rate cuts are needed this year, and last week’s labor market data did little to push consensus in either direction. The minutes will be closely watched for clues on how deep those divisions go.

Only two Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week—both non-voters—so the market will likely key off the minutes and bond market signals, especially after the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which includes an extension of tax cuts, more defense spending, and Medicaid cuts. The bill is expected to add over $3 trillion to the US debt over the next decade—raising concerns about borrowing costs.

Oil slips, energy stocks sputter

Meanwhile, oil is under renewed pressure as OPEC+ agreed to boost production by an additional 548,000 barrels per day—well above expectations—with more increases likely in September. Shell is down over 2.8% after warning of a weak second quarter, citing underperformance in its trading division and refining losses. The company also recently ruled out a bid for rival BP, adding to investor concerns.

Musk moves markets again

Tesla is back in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Shares dropped more than 7% in pre-market trading Monday after Elon Musk announced the launch of a new political party aimed at challenging Democrats and Republicans alike. The move, which drew immediate backlash from Trump, is renewing investor worries that Musk is distracted from the core business, even as EV sales slide and competition ramps up.

Earnings season kicks off—softly

While the Q2 earnings season doesn’t ramp up in earnest until mid-July, Thursday brings results from Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Conagra Brands Inc (NYSE:CAG), and Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI), offering early clues on consumer demand and corporate profitability.

For now, US equity markets remain near record highs, but with tariffs looming, oil under pressure, and earnings season kicking off against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, it’s shaping up to be a test of investor confidence—and nerves.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzA3XC9zaHV0dGVyc3RvY2stMjc1MjA4ODc1LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-07-07 13:16:21.013777

ID13,CVS Health,2025-07-07 14:49:10+00:00,The Indianapolis Star,CVS drops Zepbound. What that means for people using weight loss drug - IndyStar,Alysa Guffey,,,,,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2025/07/07/cvs-drops-zepbound-what-that-means-for-people-using-the-weight-loss-drug-wegovy-novo-nordisk/84418152007/,"As of July 1, CVS dropped Zepbound from preferred coverage for those covered by its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark.
Here's what to know if you are affected by the CVS Caremark formulary change.
What to do if you get Zepbound through CVS Caremark First, check your mailbox.
Those using weight loss drugs on coverage plans different from the standard formulary are not impacted.
CVS Caremark estimates between 25 to 30 million people use its standard formulary template, comprising about 30% of its entire membership base.","When Zepbound, Eli Lilly's highly anticipated weight loss drug, hit the market a year and a half ago, it marked a turning point for the accessibility of weight loss drugs.

Since then, Zepbound, the brand name for tirzepatide, has nearly become a household drug brand. Lilly estimates 4.5 million people take one of the Indianapolis drugmaker's GLP-1 medicines to lose weight or curb other health concerns like sleep apnea.

But a recent coverage change by a major pharmacy benefit manager may force many to decide how much they're willing to pay for the drug or whether they want to try another weight loss option.

As of July 1, CVS dropped Zepbound from preferred coverage for those covered by its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark. Novo Nordisk A/S's Wegovy, a semiglutide injectable medicine, is now the primary weight loss drug offered on CVS's standard formulary, a list of medications an insurance plan covers.

The news was not only a blow to Lilly but also a surprise to millions using Zepbound on Caremark plans, who are now questioning how to move forward.

Here's what to know if you are affected by the CVS Caremark formulary change.

What to do if you get Zepbound through CVS Caremark

First, check your mailbox. Those affected should have received a letter with additional information and next steps that could vary person to person.

Generally speaking, under the formulary change, CVS Caremark will now cover Wegovy for patients prescribed GLP-1 drugs, and patients on Caremark insurance plans should be able to switch easily.

Those who currently use Zepbound on an insurance plan negotiated by Caremark should have received a letter stating the date their transition goes into effect. Some transitions may happen later than July 1, depending on the plan's sponsor.

The coverage change only applies to employer and union insurance plans that choose the standard formulary template, about one-third of the population Caremark covers. Those using weight loss drugs on coverage plans different from the standard formulary are not impacted.

Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about switching. Caremark offers a medical exceptions process for patients to gain access to off-formulary medications if the preferred alternative is ineffective.

Or, talk to your employer. Some employers negotiate their own coverage plans so they may be able to switch to a non-standard formulary.

Lilly also offers resources online to those on Zepbound.

How much does Zepbound cost out of pocket?

The list price for Zepbound sits at $1,086 for a 28-day supply, for those without insurance.

Lilly estimates patients who have insurance that covers Zepbound pay as little as $25 for a one or three-month supply. Those with commercial insurance plans that do not cover Zepbound may be eligible for a 1-month supply that runs $650. One month equates to 28 days, or four injectable pens.

Can you get Zepbound directly from Lilly?

Yes. Lilly sells vials of Zepbound to consumers through its online sales portal, LillyDirect.

The lowest dose of 2.5 milligrams starts at $349 for four single doses that will last four weeks. Higher dose packs start at $499.

The Indianapolis drugmaker expanded access through LillyDirect, and providers will be able to prescribe 12.5 and 15 milligram doses starting July 7.

How many people use Zepbound and Wegovy through CVS Caremark?

CVS Caremark estimates between 25 to 30 million people use its standard formulary template, comprising about 30% of its entire membership base. However, not all of those members take weight loss drugs.

Weight loss drugs represent about 10% of what Caremark clients spend, up from 1% just a couple of years ago, a CVS executive said.

Wegovy and Zepbound use is pretty evenly split for those on weight loss drugs through Caremark plans.

Are Wegovy and Zepbound the same drug?

Not entirely.

Zepbound and Wegovy come from the same class of GLP-1 drugs and deliver significant weight loss through a once-weekly injection. But the two medications have different main active ingredients.

Zepbound's main ingredient is tirzepatide and is approved for weight loss and obstructive sleep apnea. Wegovy is a semiglutide medication and helps manage weight loss and cardiovascular health.

Though the two drugs are both approved for weight loss, a study published in May funded by Eli Lilly found that patients on Zepbound were more likely to experience weight loss. It was the first time the drugs were compared head-to-head.

Why is CVS Caremark excluding Zepbound from coverage?

Caremark says it is dropping Zepbound from preferred coverage to ultimately lower the cost of the drug for its clients.

Since Wegovy and Zepbound are clinically similar products approved for weight loss, Caremark encourages the drug manufacturers to compete against each other for preferred insurance coverage for millions of patients. Doing so, Caremark says, can significantly lower prices for employers and unions.

""Our decision to prefer Wegovy over Zepbound will deliver significant cost savings for our clients in this therapy class, and the lower net price we were able to negotiate for Wegovy will enable more employers to provide coverage for the weight loss category,"" CVS Health Vice President of External Affairs David Whitrap told IndyStar in a written statement.

Caremark expects employers and unions to expand access to Wegovy as a result of the change in policy.

Are there other GLP-1 drugs?

Two other GLP-1 injectables exist on the market, though each varies slightly from Zepbound and Wegovy.

Ozempic, the original blockbuster semaglutide injection developed by Novo Nordisk, is used to treat type 2 diabetes. Mounjaro, a Lilly tirzepatide drug, is approved to treat type 2 diabetes when combined with diet and exercise.

Eli Lilly is also well into clinical trials for the development of orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug for type 2 diabetes and weight management.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/11/26/USAT/76580679007-20241117-t-161843-z-1687233784-rc-26-x-7-akpelv-rtrmadp-3-healthobesitymedicaid.JPG?crop=2091,1176,x0,y0&width=2091&height=1176&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-07 14:14:27.108890

Earnings season is more than just a calendar—it’s the ultimate corporate report card, where a company’s promises are put to the test. This week, a fascinating mix of high-flyers, household names, and hidden gems will step into the spotlight, and their results could ignite explosive rallies or trigger painful slides.

To find the best opportunities, savvy investors look for companies with strong fundamentals that are poised for a positive surprise. Here’s your guide to the most compelling earnings reports to watch this week, along with the full calendar for your own research.

1. The High-Growth Powerhouse: Progressive (PGR)

All eyes are on insurance giant Progressive this week, and for good reason. The company is forecast to deliver a stunning 62% year-over-year surge in earnings per share (EPS). In an economy where growth can be hard to find, that number is a blockbuster.

With a strong Composite Rating of 81, Progressive already has solid fundamentals. The key question for investors: can it meet or beat these sky-high expectations? A strong report could confirm its market leadership and send the stock soaring, while any sign of weakness could be punished severely.

2. The Tech Paradox: Aehr Test Systems (AEHR)

Here’s a fascinating puzzle. Aehr Test Systems, a semiconductor equipment maker, boasts an elite Composite Rating of 97—a score reserved for the market’s top growth stocks. Yet, Wall Street expects its earnings to collapse by a jaw-dropping 103%.

This is a high-stakes test. Will the company’s guidance for the future outweigh the disastrous quarterly results? Investors will be digging through the report to understand this disconnect. This is a prime example of why you must look beyond a single metric; a high rating doesn’t guarantee a smooth ride.

3. The Consumer Bellwethers: Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Levi Strauss (LEVI)

Want a read on the American consumer? Look no further than Delta and Levi’s. Both iconic brands are facing headwinds, with Delta expected to report a 14% drop in earnings and Levi’s a 16% decline.

These reports will offer crucial clues about consumer spending habits. Are people pulling back on travel? Are they buying fewer discretionary items like new jeans? The answers could have ripple effects across the entire retail and travel sectors.

Packaging Spotlight: Plastic Leads with a Sustainable Twist

Plastic remains the dominant packaging material in the Consumer Packaged Goods market due to its cost-effectiveness, versatility, and durability. However, the focus is now on sustainable plastic innovation.

Nestlé is working toward making over 95% of its plastic packaging recyclable by 2025 and aims to cut virgin plastic usage by one-third from 2018 levels.

Unilever has already reduced its virgin plastic use by 23% and now uses 21% recycled plastic. More than half of its plastic packaging is now recyclable, reusable, or compostable.

These companies are investing in circular economy models, refill schemes, and alternative materials—ensuring that plastic remains viable without compromising environmental goals.

Product Growth Focus: Cosmetics and Personal Care

Among all product segments, cosmetics and personal care is projected to grow at the fastest rate. The skincare sub-segment, in particular, is thriving due to rising interest in natural, organic, and sustainable ingredients.

Consumers are increasingly drawn to:

Anti-aging and hydration-focused products

Vegan and cruelty-free beauty lines

Inclusive products that cater to all skin types and tones

Regional Insights: North America Maintains Leadership

North America continues to lead the global consumer packaged goods industry, supported by high consumer purchasing power and a growing preference for health-conscious and sustainable products.

Leading companies are spearheading innovation:

In October 2024, Vaseline launched a recyclable, non-metal-spring pump in the United States and Canada—part of Unilever’s commitment to reducing plastic waste.

These efforts are helping reduce the environmental impact of packaging while aligning with consumers’ desire for eco-friendly solutions.

From wellness-focused food to new-generation personal care products, the region remains a hub of product development and consumer-first thinking.

Recent Developments in the Consumer Packaged Goods Market

May 2025: Procter & Gamble launched Always Pocket Flexfoam, a discreet, resealable pouch for convenient, on-the-go protection.

March 2025: Unilever released a premium line of body washes and soaps that combine skin benefits with germ protection, housed in attractive, ergonomic packaging.

This past week, bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings, the parent company of CharterCARE, sold off arguably its most valuable remaining asset to Astrana.

Prospect sold off its 11,000 provider network to Astrana — the healthcare company formerly known as Apollo Medical Holdings, which describes itself as “a physician-centric, AI-powered healthcare company committed to delivering high-quality, patient-centered care.”

GET THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS HERE -- SIGN UP FOR GOLOCAL FREE DAILY EBLAST

The provider groups involved in the deal are located in Southern California, Texas, Arizona, and Rhode Island.

The sale by Prospect to Astrana may make it more difficult to sell the bonds necessary to save Rhode Island’s third-largest hospital group.

Bond Sales Stagnated

For the past two months, the Rhode Island Health and Education Building Corporation (RIHEBC) has been attempting to sell bonds totaling $140,665,000. The money from the bonds is to fund the deal in which Georgia-based Centurion Foundation would take over the CharterCARE hospitals from bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings. The hospitals include Roger Williams and Fatima.

Centurion has never run a hospital.

Josh Nemzoff, a top national hospital executive, said this latest development is a potential blow to the sale of the CharterCARE bonds.

“[The provider network is one of] the only profitable assets that Prospect owns, and they just sold them, which means that all those profits go to the new owner,” said Nemzoff.

The bonds were pre-marketed for weeks, which included roadshows, online presentations, and one-on-one investor meetings. The marketing started on May 7.

S&P rated the bonds as BB- with a negative outlook.

The sale of the bonds was scheduled to close on May 29; the bonds did not close, and the deal has been floundering. It is now six weeks later.

The Wall Street firm Barclays, the deal's underwriter and the group leading the marketing of the bonds, has been unable to sell a significant amount of the bonds.

“That means everything that’s left is losing even more money than before, because it’s not offset by these profitable entities. My guess is this will put even more pressure on Prospect and force them to close CharterCARE's sale as quickly as they can. If the Barclays [sale of the bonds] doesn’t go through quickly, there is significant trouble. Now that Barclays has had more than two months to market these bonds, at some point, someone’s gonna say, “This is not working,’” Nemzoff added.

According to Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for RIHEBC, the bonds are still being marketed.

The Deal

According to the press announcement on the deal, “The Company completed the acquisition of Prospect Health for a total purchase price of $708 million, a reduction from the originally announced $745 million in accordance with the terms of the executed Purchase Agreement. The updated purchase price underscores the Company's commitment to disciplined capital deployment, while maintaining full conviction in the value creation potential of the asset. The acquisition of Prospect Health will deepen Astrana's capabilities in providing access to high-quality and high-value care to communities across the country.”

""We are excited to welcome Prospect Health's physicians, providers, and team members to Astrana Health,"" said Brandon Sim, President and CEO of Astrana. ""Together, we will further accelerate our mission to drive consistent, coordinated, high-quality patient outcomes at scale, ultimately driving greater value across the healthcare ecosystem.""

Potential Big Impact

Rhode Island's healthcare system is now even more stressed.

Layoffs and closures have hit Thundermist, Providence Community Healthcare Centers, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, and Anchor Medical, to name but a few. Anchor, the primary care group that served 25,000 Rhode Islanders, closed last month.

Health insurers in Rhode Island are requesting premium increases of 20% or more.

This past week's passage of the Trump budget legislation, the so-called ""big beautiful bill,"" is expected to adversely impact the Medicaid coverage for tens of thousands in Rhode Island.

CharterCARE employs 2,400 full and part-time employees. Just over 1,100 of those jobs are union.

If the bonds do sell and Centurion takes control, CharterCARE would change from for-profit to not-for-profit, and the respective host cities, Providence (Roger Williams Hospital) and North Providence (Fatima), would lose approximately $6.5 million combined in tax revenues.

The two hospitals, combined, have 552 beds, conducted over 17,000 surgeries in 2024, and saw over 377,000 visits last year.

Olo is being sold. The giant online ordering provider has a deal to be acquired by investment firm Thoma Bravo for $2 billion, or $10.25 per share. The deal will take Olo private after four years as a public company, during which its share price declined by about 65%. Olo said joining Thoma Bravo will help accelerate its goal of digitizing more restaurant transactions.

Small independent restaurants saw minimal sales growth of 0.4% in June 2025 compared to June 2024, but concerning month-over-month declines in transactions, at -2.6%, and foot traffic, at -2.5%, signal weakening consumer activity. Fiserv's Small Business Index shows that only 13 states experienced positive foodservice performance in June, which is down from 34 in May. Fiserv attributes this to economic uncertainty causing cautious consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items.

Companies exempt from reporting on non-material activities—defined as under 10% of revenue, CapEx, or OpEx.

Reporting templates streamlined—datapoints cut by 64% for non-financial firms and 89% for financial firms.

New measures apply from January 2026, with an option to delay until the 2026 financial year.

The European Commission has adopted a Delegated Act to streamline the EU Taxonomy framework, significantly easing the compliance load for financial and non-financial companies. The changes are part of a broader effort under the Omnibus I package to reduce administrative and reporting burdens across sustainability regulations.

“Today we take a decisive step towards a more growth-friendly, usable and proportionate sustainable finance framework,“ said Maria Luís Albuquerque, Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union.

“Our measures simplify the application of the EU Taxonomy and strike the right balance between reducing excessive administrative burden for our companies, while keeping our longer-term goals in focus, including the transition to a sustainable economy.”

Key Changes in the Simplification Package:

Materiality Thresholds Introduced:

Companies will no longer be required to assess EU Taxonomy eligibility or alignment for economic activities that are not financially material to their operations.

For non-financial companies, activities are non-material if they make up less than 10% of revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx), or operational expenditure (OpEx).

For financial companies, the same threshold applies to financial assets financing specific economic activities, provided the use of proceeds is known.

OpEx Reporting Relief:

Non-financial firms may now omit Taxonomy alignment assessments for total operating expenditures if these are not material to their business model. They are only required to report the total OpEx value along with a justification of non-materiality.

Simplified Reporting Templates:

Non-financial companies: 64% reduction in required datapoints.

Financial institutions: 89% reduction in datapoints, including simplified disclosure of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR).

“Do No Significant Harm” Criteria Adjusted:

Rules under the pollution prevention and control objective—especially those involving chemicals—have been clarified and simplified to ease compliance while maintaining environmental integrity.

RELATED ARTICLE: European Commission to Withdraw Greenwashing Regulation

Timeline and Implementation:

The changes are formalized in a Delegated Act amending the Taxonomy Disclosures, Climate, and Environmental Delegated Acts. Following a four-month scrutiny period by the European Parliament and Council—extendable by two additional months—the updated rules will:

Apply from 1 January 2026, covering the 2025 financial year.

Allow companies the option to delay implementation to the 2026 financial year if preferred.

These measures aim to align Europe’s green transition with its competitiveness goals by reducing bureaucratic friction in sustainable finance disclosures, without compromising environmental ambitions.

The world's largest coffee chain teased the July arrival of four new Starbucks drinks last month. One of them, the Firework Frappuccino, aptly made its shortly before the Fourth of July.

The other three were new variants of the Strato Frappuccino, which replaces the standard whipped cream with a layer of cold foam.

According to a report from People's Erin Clements, Starbucks announced Monday that it plans to roll out the three Strato flavors – Salted Caramel Mocha, Strawberry Matcha and Brown Sugar – on Tuesday, July 8. The ""Strato"" name is derived from the Italian word for ""layer,"" with all three drinks staying true to the label.

The Brown Sugar Strato tops off the classic Frappuccino roast coffee, ice and milk with a layer of brown sugar foam and sprinkle of cinnamon.

The Salted Caramel Mocha uses a layer of salted caramel foam with mocha sauce and additional caramel drizzle on top.

Originally published on U.S. Bank company blog

U.S. Bank released its third Small Business Perspective survey report, revealing how owners across the country are responding to an environment defined by rapid change. The nationwide survey of 1,000 small business owners explored how they are navigating challenges ranging from economic stressors to the rise of generative AI, all while remaining focused on long-term growth, succession planning, and leaving a lasting legacy.

""This year's survey makes it clear that small business owners are committed to future-proofing their businesses in response to today's economic climate and rapid technological change,"" said Shruti Patel, U.S. Bank's Chief Product Officer for Business Banking. ""From embracing generative AI to responding to shifting economic conditions like tariffs and thinking proactively about succession, owners are serious about the future of their businesses. There is a real opportunity - and responsibility - for financial institutions to show up as strategic partners in helping small businesses navigate what's next.""

Handing the Reins to the Next Generation

With more than half of U.S. small business owners now over age 55, succession planning is becoming increasingly urgent. While many owners are not yet ready to step away - with only 54% having created a succession plan - new generations are preparing to take their place: more than one-third (36%) of Gen Z and Millennial owners say they plan to acquire a business from a retiring owner.

The report reveals a striking gap between intention and action. While 85% of surveyed participants say they originally became an owner to create something they could pass on, and 84% wanted to create generational wealth for their family, only 54% have a formal succession plan in place.

A growing number of owners (62%) have seen their retirement timelines accelerate in the past five years. But for many, navigating succession is a challenge:

62% find the process overwhelming

56% worry they won't get a reasonable price for their business when it's time to sell

53% lack the proper resources or guidance to plan for the future of their business

Owners with strong business performance were more likely to have a succession plan in place: 64% of those with a plan reported significant growth over the past year, compared to 50% of those without a plan.

Nearly 4 in 10 small business owners (37%) say they plan to sell their business in the next 12 months, suggesting how quickly transitions of ownership may be approaching for some businesses. However, retiring business owners are not the only ones looking to sell, with a higher number of Gen Z and Millennial owners (41%) than Boomers and Gen X (33%) saying they plan to sell their business.

While the small business landscape has changed dramatically over the years, the motivations that originally inspired owners still drive them today. Most remain deeply committed to their work: 86% want to continue running their business as long as possible, and 87% are hopeful they'll leave behind a positive legacy when they eventually step away.

Economic Pressures are Influencing How Owners Operate

The need for small business owners to make long-term plans is reinforced by the day-to-day worries they are facing. Respondents reported their top macroeconomic stressors as:

The economic environment (98%)

Inflation or increased costs of materials / supplies (92%)

Competition (92%)

The ability of consumers to maintain their spending (86%)

Fraud or cybersecurity threats (85%)

Obtaining enough funding to support my business (84%)

Among other stressors small business owners cited, 4 out of 5 (81%) owners felt at least somewhat stressed about tariffs.

Despite these stressors, 96% of owners reported their business as currently successful and 88% saw growth in the past year. To manage pressures and position their businesses for the future, many owners are prioritizing key steps in the year ahead, including focusing on revenue (48%), ensuring enough staff (33%), improving company efficiency and cost-effectiveness (32%), and reacting to the general economic landscape such as inflation and recession risk (29%).

To get a pulse check on the most current sentiment, U.S. Bank conducted a follow-up survey of 500 small business leaders during the month of May. While stress levels on the economic environment were similarly high, two-thirds (66%) said the country's economy is moving in the right direction, with only 18% saying it's going in the wrong direction. This sentiment was even stronger among younger business leaders (Gen Z and Millennial), with 74% saying it was moving in the right direction, vs. 52% of leaders from older generations (Gen X and Boomer).

Despite this optimism, a majority (58%) of the leaders expressed at least some concern that tariffs may impact their business operations, and 57% expect their input costs to go up as a result of tariffs with most expecting a cost increase between 1-10%. At the same time, leaders were slightly more likely to anticipate a positive rather than negative impact from tariffs across several business factors - including cost of goods, customer demand, margin profitability, capital investments, and labor/HR - but these expectations were generally modest, with most leaders expressing a neutral or only slightly positive outlook on the potential effects of tariffs.

Small Business Owners are Turning to Gen AI and Digital Tools to Stay Competitive

As small business owners look to create long-term success for their businesses, they are embracing generative AI (Gen AI) and digital tools. Nearly 6 in 10 (57%) are currently using or plan to implement Gen AI solutions in the next year. Among those using it, the top applications include content creation (44%), data analysis and information gathering (41%), and marketing and sales strategies (39%).

The majority of owners using Gen AI have found that adoption doesn't require a massive investment. Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) Gen AI users report spending less than $50 a month on it, and nearly 1 in 5 (18%) are using free tools or subscriptions. These tools allow users to spend more time on the personal connection they have with their customers (88%).

Still, the rise of AI is not without tension. Over 8 in 10 (81%) report keeping up with technological advancements such as Gen AI is stressful, and 56% worry their business (or products / services) will be replaced by Gen AI or automation.

Beyond AI, digital tools are seen as essential now more than ever. The number of owners who view digital tools as very important or essential jumped a striking 15 percentage points from last year (87% in 2025 vs. 72% in 2024). At the same time, 63% say they're overwhelmed by the number of tools needed to run their business and 82% say consolidating them is a priority.

Looking at payment methods, nearly half (48%) of owners still report cash as a primary method of in-person payment. However, newer methods of payment are catching up with 42% reporting tap-to-pay as a primary method.

Despite Challenges, Most Owners Would Do It Again

Even amid today's business challenges, most small business owners remain grounded in their original purpose that inspired them to become entrepreneurs. When asked why they launched their business, 90% say they wanted to be their own boss, 88% cited a desire to control their financial future, and 86% wanted their passions to be part of their work.

Legacy has also played a defining role. More than two-thirds (67%) of owners come from a family of entrepreneurs, and 62% took over a relative's business to carry on their family legacy. For Gen Z and Millennial entrepreneurs, however, the path to ownership has often been shaped by necessity. More than half (52%) of younger owners say they became business owners because they couldn't find a job elsewhere, compared to 44% of Gen X and Boomer owners.

When asked if they'd do it all over again, 80% of owners say they'd still start their business today. This confidence is particularly notable given challenges they see in today's environment. Almost 8 in 10 (79%) say there is greater market competition today than when they started and 70% say that securing funding and capital is more difficult now.

The key takeaway: Marketers must move beyond siloed systems and embrace connected data to understand better, engage, and retain consumers in an increasingly complex omnichannel world.

“The consumer journey is happening across digital and physical spaces,” Neely writes. “Yet most brands are still unable to connect the dots because their data is disconnected.”

Connected Data Powers Real-Time Personalization

By adopting platforms like SAP S/4HANA and SAP Emarsys, Neely says, brands can unify customer data, develop more accurate profiles, and activate AI-driven personalization at scale. This enables capabilities like:

Triggered mobile offers that drive in-store purchases

Progressive profiling to gather valuable customer insights over time

Real-time product recommendations powered by AI

Unified customer data across departments from marketing to supply chain

SAP cites candy maker Ferrara—owner of brands like NERDS and Jelly Belly—as a case study in transformation. The company integrated SAP tools to modernize legacy systems, create unified profiles, and turn casual buyers into brand fans.

Neely offers several practical steps for marketers aiming to grow their consumer database and boost engagement:

Create omnichannel opt-in experiences using progressive profiling to collect data gradually.

Use personalized incentives to re-engage former subscribers via web forms and email.

Leverage AI and automation to scale personalized campaigns and free up creative teams.

Align digital and in-store messaging to close the engagement loop.

The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers.
Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.","WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump's current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.

The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president.

The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump's import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.

The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.

Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.

Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: ""Everything's going well.""

The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework.

Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent ""into our Territory"" and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods.

In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. ""TOTAL ACCESS"" to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning ""we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff."" He added he thinks SUVs ""will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.""

There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses' inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.

The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers.

The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel's ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.

The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate.

The findings are presented in our report: Mastering the Sale: 2025 Insights for Private Business Owners. With its candid, first-hand accounts and expert advice from BNY specialists, this report offers unique perspectives on the business of selling a business.

Smart sellers plan ahead

A business owner who begins deal preparations today won’t be selling into the market we have now, but the market of tomorrow. Indeed, 38% of owners in this study expressed regret they didn’t devote enough time to deal preparation. Ideally, a two-year runway ensures a smoother deal process. While the timing of a sale depends on each business owner’s unique circumstances, dedicating more time to developing the right strategy beforehand can ultimately result in a successful exit.

Make it less taxing

Tax and estate planning can make or break the overall success of a sale. In fact, 40% of study participants wished they had engaged in tax and estate planning earlier. Trusts, such as Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs), Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs), Dynasty Trusts, and other wealth planning strategies may be essential for managing and protecting sale proceeds, reducing income and estate taxes, and transferring wealth across generations.

Build your team

To effectively navigate a sale, business owners will need to assemble their ‘deal team’ of expert advisors. This team will likely include an investment banker, wealth manager, certified public accountant, mergers & acquisitions attorney and a trust & estate attorney. Access to well-connected professionals with strong industry expertise provides sellers with essential guidance, advice and greater peace of mind throughout the deal process.

“You want advisors close to you who know your business and your family. Set this team up early. Establish regular meetings, so everyone knows each other and can work well together. You’re leveraging your team’s expertise, and that team is greater than the sum of its parts. Setting up this team early will allow the most success during and post-sale.”

Heather B. Cheney

Senior Wealth Strategist, BNY Wealth

Add AI to your deal team

A larger than expected 75% of respondents said they used or plan to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist them with selling their business. As AI technology rapidly evolves, it is expected to play a growing role in ways that assist the sale of a business, including compliance, valuation, accounting and financial preparation.

Life beyond the sale

Preparing for a sale can take years, making it easy to overlook the importance of what comes afterward. Sellers often leave behind longstanding relationships with employees and customers and are worried about carving out a new identity. To ease the transition, 90% remained involved temporarily as consultants or advisors, while 70% maintained an ownership stake in the business.

We understand that navigating the sale process can appear to be a formidable challenge. With careful planning, strategic guidance and the right support, a successful business sale can be a catalyst for unlocking new opportunities and securing a lasting legacy.

Employees are no longer content with just a paycheck—they demand environments that prioritize their mental and physical health, flexibility, and work-life balance. Companies that fail to adapt risk losing top talent, enduring higher turnover costs, and falling behind peers. Conversely, organizations investing in employee well-being are reaping rewards: higher productivity, stronger retention, and superior stock performance. This article explores why ""well-being-driven"" enterprises are becoming must-hold investments and how to identify them.

The Productivity Payoff: Well-Being as a Profit Multiplier

Recent data reveals a clear link between employee well-being and productivity. A McKinsey Health Institute report (2025) found that companies embedding holistic well-being programs—covering mental health, flexible work, and boundary-setting tools—achieve up to 20% higher productivity than peers. This isn't just about avoiding burnout; it's about fostering creativity and resilience. For instance, firms using AI-driven analytics (e.g., Microsoft's Viva Insights) to monitor workloads and stress levels report 15% faster problem-solving and 30% higher innovation output.

Microsoft's focus on hybrid work flexibility and employee wellness correlates with a 25% stock gain since 2023, outperforming Exxon's flat trajectory.

Retention: The Ultimate Cost-Saving Tool

High turnover is a silent killer of profitability. The 2024 Global Talent Retention Index estimates that replacing an employee costs 1.5–2x their annual salary. Companies prioritizing well-being slash this risk. A Deloitte study shows firms with robust well-being programs retain employees 10% longer, reducing recruitment costs and maintaining institutional knowledge.

Unilever's adoption of ISO 45003 psychosocial risk standards correlates with a 40% lower turnover rate compared to industry averages.

The Stock Market's Love Affair with Well-Being

Wall Street is catching on. A 2025 S&P analysis reveals that S&P 500 companies with top-tier well-being scores (as measured by employee satisfaction, DEI metrics, and health programs) have delivered 18% higher total returns over five years than those in the bottom quartile. This outperformance isn't accidental: well-being-driven firms attract top talent, stabilize labor costs, and avoid productivity-draining burnout.

Tech giants like Salesforce (CRM), which invest in mental health days and flexible work, have surged 35% since 2023, while healthcare laggards like CVS Health (CVS)—still grappling with outdated workplace policies—lag behind.

Risks for Laggards: Stagnation and Talent Exodus

The cost of resistance is steep. Companies clinging to 9-to-5 rigidities or ignoring burnout face a triple threat:

1. Talent Drain: A 2024 Glassdoor survey found 68% of workers would leave a job without mental health support.

2. Legal Pushback: The “Right to Disconnect” laws in 20+ countries (e.g., France, Japan) and the EU's Work-Life Balance Directive penalize non-compliance.

3. Reputation Damage: Social media and employee review sites amplify criticism of toxic workplaces, deterring customers and investors alike.

How to Invest: Spotting Well-Being Champions

Focus on firms demonstrating three pillars of well-being leadership:

1. Flexibility: Look for hybrid work models, remote options, and compressed workweeks (e.g., Microsoft's 4-day trials in Japan).

2. Health Investment: Prioritize companies offering mental health days, sleep programs, and preventive care (e.g., IBM's partnership with Headspace).

3. Accountability: Seek transparency via ESG reports or certifications like ISO 45003.

Top Sectors to Watch:

- Tech: Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM)

- Healthcare: UnitedHealth (UNH), Cigna (CI)

- AI/Analytics: NVIDIA (NVDA), Veeva Systems (VEEV)

Conclusion: Well-Being is the New Competitive Edge

The data is unequivocal: companies that invest in employee well-being aren't just doing good—they're doing well. From productivity gains to stock outperformance, the ROI is clear. For investors, the path is straightforward: allocate capital to firms prioritizing work-life balance, and avoid those clinging to outdated models. The well-being economy isn't a trend—it's the future of work.

High employee satisfaction (90+ scores) correlates with 20-30% higher stock returns over five years.

The BHRRC is calling for major fashion brands to respect the people who work for them.
Reports like The Missing Thread are pressuring fast-fashion companies to do better.","A report from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre has called out many major fashion brands for their harmful labor practices.

What's happening?

Al Jazeera stated that the report, titled The Missing Thread, looked at 65 global fashion brands. Forty-four of them had previously pledged to reduce carbon emissions, but none of them created a ""just transition"" policy.

Just transition policies aim to protect workers while companies shift to cleaner energy. Of the 65 analyzed, only two companies are doing anything to protect their workers. One was Inditex, which owns Zara, and the other was Gucci's parent company, Kering.

Companies that have the least worker protections in conjunction with environmental policies include Hermes, Nike, and H&M.

Why should the fast-fashion industry change its ways?

The BHRRC is calling for major fashion brands to respect the people who work for them. Otherwise, their environmental policies are greenwashing.

As Natalie Swan, BHRRC's labour rights programme manager, said in a news release: ""The fashion industry's climate targets mean little if the people who make its products are not taken into consideration. It's not enough to go green. It has to be clean and fair.""

The United Nations Development Programme says that the concept of a just transition was first discussed in the 1980s. U.S. trade unions embraced it so workers weren't left behind when new pollution regulations took effect.

Just transitions value the public and local solutions. They also strive to create green jobs with living wages and health benefits.

Fast-fashion companies notoriously mistreat their workers, but a just transition could reverse some of the damage. If companies do this effectively, they could drastically reduce the dirty energy they use and the textile waste they produce every year.

What's being done about the lack of worker protections?

""Decarbonisation strategies, done right, protect workers and communities, reduce long-term risk and lay the foundation for stronger, fairer, and more resilient supply chains,"" Swan said in BHRRC's news release.

Reports like The Missing Thread are pressuring fast-fashion companies to do better. If we keep the pressure up, it's more likely that companies will change their ways.

In the meantime, breaking up with fast fashion can help. Minimizing what you consume can also be an effective action to take.

“Hybrid automation with agentic AI is a key priority for enterprise decision-makers in the next three years,” said Charlie Dai, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.

The global business process outsourcing (BPO) market, including BPS, was valued at $300 billion in 2024 according to Grand View Research, which projects the market will surge to $525 billion in 2030, driven by demand for new technologies such as generative AI.

Capgemini has reached a definitive agreement to acquire WNS, and plans to it into its Global Business Services portfolio when the deal closes some time before the end of the year. It expects the deal to help it serve enterprise clients seeking intelligent automation and digital transformation.

Forrester’s Dai said WNS’s domain-specific AI agents and agentic AI platforms, especially the AI.Agentic suite and WNS Expirius, will effectively help Capgemini enhance its agent-driven business process services and offer the same to its existing customers.

For Gartner vice president analyst DD Mishra, WNS’s investments in intelligent automation, analytics, and agentic solutions including its TRAC analytics suite and Malkom knowledge management platform will complement Capgemini’s existing technology and consulting strengths.

Sharath Srinivasamurthy, research vice president at IDC, pointed to the acquisitions WNS has itself made in recent months, including Kipi.ai, Smart Cube, and OptiBuy to enhance its data, analytics, and procurement stack and extend its proficiency in business process operations, said.

However, Rajesh Ranjan, managing partner at Everest Group, views the WNS acquisition as more of a strategic play rather than being focused on garnering more agentic tools or capabilities.

“The key driver behind the acquisition is less to do with the tools or software but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table, a pre-requisite to develop and deploy real-world AI solutions,” Ranjan said, adding that agentic AI is still in its infancy and are largely locked in pilot stages across enterprises.

WNS’s 600 clients should expect to receive sales calls Capgemini once the deal closes, said IDC’s Srinivasamurthy: “This a huge opportunity for Capgemini to cross-sell technology services to them and position as a true technology driven end-to-end service provider.”

However, recent quarters have tested its resilience, with margin pressures, leadership upheavals, and regulatory scrutiny casting a shadow over its stock performance. Despite these challenges, the company's strategic focus on complex patient cohorts, AI-driven efficiency, and vertical integration positions it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. This analysis argues that UNH's current underperformance is a buying opportunity for investors with a multi-year horizon.

The Near-Term Storm: Margin Pressures and Leadership Transitions

UnitedHealth's Q2 2025 results revealed significant margin compression in its Optum Health division, driven by higher utilization in senior care (orthopedics, cardiology) and behavioral health. While CEO Andrew Witty's exit and a 45% market cap decline since Q1 2025 have spooked investors, these challenges are not existential. The margin squeeze stems from a deliberate strategy to acquire complex patient cohorts—those requiring intensive outpatient care—which carry higher upfront costs but promise long-term value.

The illustrates the divergence: UNH's shares have stagnated, while broader markets rose. This underperformance reflects short-term concerns, not structural flaws. Meanwhile, the shows medical loss ratios remain stable at ~85%, underscoring that cost pressures are concentrated in specific segments rather than systemic.

Strategic Investments: Building for the Future

Complex Patient Cohorts: UnitedHealth's focus on seniors and behavioral health patients aligns with an aging population and rising mental health needs. While these groups initially strain margins, their long-term retention and improved care coordination will boost profitability. As CEO Stephen Hemsley stated, “The challenges we face are largely within our control,” emphasizing the company's ability to refine benefits and pricing.

Vertical Integration: Acquisitions in home health (LHC Group, Amedisys), ambulatory care (SurgeryCenter.com), and behavioral health (Refresh Mental Health) are critical to its integrated care model. These moves reduce reliance on third-party providers, allowing UNH to control costs and improve care continuity—a key differentiator in value-based care.

AI and Operational Efficiency: UnitedHealth's AI initiatives—automating medical appeals, optimizing provider networks, and enhancing fraud detection—are already reducing G&A expenses. The could cut operating expenses by 15–20% over the next two years, offsetting margin pressures.

Leadership Stabilization and Compliance Focus

The departure of Andrew Witty and the return of veteran CEO Stephen Hemsley mark a shift toward operational discipline. Hemsley's track record of turning around UNH during prior crises instills confidence. Additionally, the appointment of Dr. Patrick Conway to lead Optum signals a focus on clinical expertise and compliance. Former Optum CEO Heather Cianfrocco's new role in governance and cybersecurity underscores a commitment to addressing regulatory risks, such as the ongoing DOJ investigation into Medicare Advantage practices.

Risks and Mitigations

Regulatory Scrutiny: Investigations into Medicare fraud and PBM legislation pose risks, but UNH has already begun adjusting its benefit designs and compliance protocols.

Market Competition: Peers like Elevance Health and Centene are outperforming UNH due to its self-inflicted margin issues. However, UNH's scale and diversified revenue streams (insurance, pharmacy, digital health) provide a moat.

Investment Thesis: Buy with a 3–5 Year Horizon

While near-term EPS guidance has been lowered, UnitedHealth's raised 2023 EPS target ($26.50 vs. $26.00) and stable MLR suggest resilience. The stock's current P/E of ~14x (vs. a 5-year average of 18x) reflects pessimism about its ability to navigate challenges. However, the could rebound to 8–10% annually as margin pressures ease and AI savings materialize.

Conclusion: A Leader in Transition

UnitedHealth's current struggles are a test of its strategic vision, not its viability. The investments in complex patient cohorts, AI, and vertical integration are bets on the future of healthcare—where integrated, data-driven care models dominate. For investors willing to overlook short-term volatility, UNH offers a compelling entry point at a valuation discount. Buy the dip.",,N,,2025-07-07 13:15:43.766636

The chain is introducing premium features across these locations, including lounge-style seating, warmer lighting, and locally inspired wall art, in an effort to cultivate a traditional coffeehouse feel and encourage customers to spend more time in stores.

Newsweek has contacted Starbucks outside of regular working hours via email for comment.

Why It Matters

The major changes come after Starbucks took a hit when its baristas went on strike before Christmas, waiting times for orders grew longer, and its Q4 earnings report for the last fiscal year showed a 7 percent decline in global sales.

Since stepping in as CEO in September 2024, Niccol launched the ""Back to Starbucks"" initiative to try to encourage customers to come back to the stores.

When he was appointed as the new leader of the major chain, Starbucks' shares leapt up 18 percent after two consecutive quarters of sale slumps, Fortune reported, suggesting there are lot of expectations weighing on Niccol's shoulders to bring the company's sales back up to speed.

What To Know

The first remodeled locations, including stores in Bridgehampton and East Hampton, New York, now showcase cozy chairs, hardwood floors, and artwork on the walls that capture the spirit of the areas' local communities.

Starbucks has also brought back ceramic mugs for some in-store orders and reintroduced the self-service condiment bar. Baristas were also instructed to be welcoming to customers and leave hand-written notes on cups.

The redesigns are part of a comprehensive strategy to reverse the downward slope in sales by enhancing the customer experience and reestablishing Starbucks as a welcoming ""third place,"" a space of respite over coffee away from home and work—a vision first championed by former CEO Howard Schultz.

Alongside the aesthetic updates, Starbucks has focused on operational changes such as streamlining its food and beverage menu, by reducing some options for customizations, and introducing a new order sequencing algorithm to reduce wait times.

The company said that the measures enabled three-quarters of orders at test locations to arrive in under 4 minutes during peak hours, Fortune reported.

In June, Starbucks also hosted over 14,000 coffeehouse leaders from across North America at its Leadership Experience 2025 in Las Vegas in June, as part of the initiative. At the event, leaders had the chance to engage in workshops, connect and network, and hear directly from company leaders.

What People Are Saying

Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol said in June: ""'Getting 'Back to Starbucks' means refocusing on what has always set us apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. We are bringing together our coffeehouse leaders from across North America to celebrate, empower and equip them to accelerate our transformation.

""The coffeehouse experience defines the Starbucks brand, and these leaders and their teams bring that experience to life for millions of customers every day.""

Starbucks' Chief Operating Officer (COO) Mike Grams said in June: ""This isn't just a reset—it's a recommitment to who we are when we are at our best. We're making progress, have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan and are on the right track to turn the business around.

""Our turnaround is rooted in listening—to partners and customers—and taking action on what we hear. We're listening and testing in the coffeehouse, and then applying our learnings to scale quickly and enhance the customer and partner experience.""

But the candy industry, led by M&M’s maker Mars, resists, citing costs, taste challenges, and lack of natural alternatives.

States like Texas and West Virginia plan independent bans and warnings, potentially forcing nationwide change.

Less than three months after declaring war on synthetic food dyes, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has scored significant wins in reshaping America’s food landscape. Major manufacturers—including Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Nestlé, ConAgra, and PepsiCo—have agreed to remove petroleum-based dyes from popular items like Jell-O snacks, Kool-Aid drinks, and Lucky Charms cereals by the end of 2027.

The pledges come amid growing concern over links between synthetic dyes and behavioral issues in children, highlighted by studies like California’s 2021 review concluding that artificial dyes can trigger neurobehavioral problems in some kids.

Yet a vibrant and powerful opponent remains: the candy industry.

M&M’s resist change

Despite Kennedy’s momentum, candy companies are digging in. Mars, the privately held maker of M&M’s and Skittles, insists its products are safe and says sweeping changes would be costly and technically difficult. Mars previously attempted to drop artificial colors in 2016 but reversed course after finding American consumers still craved brightly colored candies—even as European customers shifted toward natural hues.

Some candy makers say that the dyes not only add color, but also taste. Without them, candy can end up tasting like raw vegetables or worse, they say. The National Confectioners Association has signaled that candy companies won’t reformulate without federal mandates.

State laws may force the issue

Kennedy’s voluntary approach has critics, but it’s producing progress where federal regulation might stall. The FDA is moving to revoke certain dye approvals and has cleared new natural colors for use, avoiding lengthy court battles but that's a slow process prone to court intervention.

Meanwhile, states are stepping in. Texas will require warning labels on foods containing dyes starting in 2027, and West Virginia plans broader bans in 2028. Consumer advocates predict that industry holdouts, including candy makers, will eventually bend under state-by-state pressure.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/mandms-ca-2025.webp,N,,2025-07-07 11:11:54.711460

The latest closure notice impacts the Rite Aid located in the Summit Square shopping center along the Newtown Bypass in Middletown Township.

The new closure adds to a growing list of local Rite Aid shutdowns, including locations on New Falls Road in Bristol Township’s Levittown section, in the Shoppes at Flowers Mill on North Flowers Mill Road in Middletown Township, on Pond Street in Bristol Borough, and on Lincoln Highway in the Fairless Hills section of Falls Township.

Employees have been informing customers of the upcoming closures.

The closings are part of a nationwide wave as the Philadelphia-based company continues to grapple with significant financial challenges.

Rite Aid initially filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and emerged in 2024, but recently announced it is “pursuing a strategic and value-maximizing sale process for substantially all of its assets.”

Retail locations in Bristol Borough and Falls Township closed during the 2023 bankruptcy.

In spring, Rite Aid sold its pharmacy assets to several companies, including CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Albertsons and Kroger.

Despite its prior restructuring, local Rite Aid stores have reportedly faced issues with bare shelves for the past two years.

A court document filed in New Jersey bankruptcy court indicated that Rite Aid’s post-bankruptcy plan was contingent on vendors returning to less restrictive payment terms and assurances of credit from capital providers, which the company claims did not materialize.

Rite Aid also cited macroeconomic pressures and reduced consumer spending as contributing factors to its financial woes.

Customers are advised that Rite Aid stopped honoring gift cards and accepting returns or exchanges after June 5.

Earlier this year, Rite Aid operated more than 1,000 stores nationwide, with hundreds now slated for closure.

Whether ceramic mugs and cushy seating can reignite the café culture that made Starbucks iconic remains to be seen.","Starbucks is rolling out a major redesign of its stores, and founder Howard Schultz says it made him want to do a cartwheel.

Led by CEO Brian Niccol, the coffee giant is testing a new wave of “coffeehouse of the future” features, starting in New York and Southern California, Fortune reported. The move is part of a broader initiative called “Back to Starbucks,” aimed at reimagining the store experience and encouraging customers to spend more time—and money—inside the café.

The redesigned stores feature cozy chairs and couches, Starbucks’ signature green tones, hardwood floors, and regionally inspired wall art meant to give each location a more local, personal feel. A Bridgehampton, NY location leans into darker tones and plush seating, while a store in East Hampton nods to the town’s nautical roots.

Starbucks is also bringing back the once-retired condiment bar, offering ceramic mugs for some in-house orders, and instructing baristas to create a warmer, more personalized experience. The idea? Make Starbucks feel less like a fast-coffee chain and more like a true neighborhood hangout.

Operationally, the company is also tightening up. It has trimmed menu options, limited drink customizations, and piloted a new order sequencing algorithm that’s already reduced peak-time wait times to under four minutes at test stores.

Founder Howard Schultz, who stepped away from day-to-day operations, praised the effort, saying the new direction made him so happy he “did a cartwheel.”

The changes come as Starbucks works to regain momentum. Sales dipped slightly below Wall Street expectations in the second quarter, but Niccol isn’t backing down. “We have a lot of work ahead, but we are on the right track and moving quickly,” he said in April.

Starbucks isn’t just updating furniture. It’s trying to rewire how customers think about the brand. Whether ceramic mugs and cushy seating can reignite the café culture that made Starbucks iconic remains to be seen.

The initiative pairs women studying business, engineering, art, and fashion with Dior employees in their same concentrations.

Art Nouveau architect and Paris Métro designer Hector Guimard will get his own museum.

Paris will open a museum dedicated to Art Nouveau architect Hector Guimard—best known for designing the city’s iconic Métro entrances—inside one of his own architectural landmarks, the Hôtel Mezzara. Located in the 16th arrondissement, the 1910 townhouse will undergo restoration under a 50-year lease agreement and is slated to open as the Musée Guimard by late 2027 or early 2028. The initiative, spearheaded by private backers and preservation advocates, comes after years of campaigning to save the building and honor Guimard’s legacy.

Hoping to raise funds, Albright College moves to auction its 500-piece art collection.

To address a $20 million budgetary deficit, Albright College plans to auction more than 500 works from its art collection, including pieces by Jasper Johns and Jacob Lawrence, through Pook & Pook on July 16. The move has drawn criticism from donors, including the family of Doris C. Freedman, who argue the sale undermines the collection’s educational purpose and offers limited financial relief.

Not everyone is happy about Wimbledon shifting from human judges to A.I.-assisted line calls.

British tennis player Jack Draper criticized Wimbledon’s use of A.I.-assisted line calls, saying the system lacked full accuracy, and lamented the removal of human line judges. Tournament director Jamie Baker defended the shift, noting that live electronic line calling is now standard across the tour and has become more sophisticated over time. Despite pushback, officials maintain the system improves reliability and allows for later match play.

Beltone launches Robin AI unit to drive MENA digital transformation and enterprise automation from Cairo headquarters.

Robin offers AI-powered dashboards, predictive analytics, and strategic tools to boost business efficiency across key MENA sectors.

Dalia Khorshid steers Beltone’s tech-driven shift beyond investment banking with strong earnings and impact-focused capital injections.

Beltone Holding, the Cairo-based financial services group led by Egyptian business executive Dalia Khorshid, has unveiled Robin, a new data science and artificial intelligence subsidiary aimed at accelerating digital transformation across the MENA region.

The wholly owned unit, headquartered in Cairo, is positioned to deliver intelligent, scalable AI solutions tailored to large enterprises, startups, and key sectors across Egypt and the broader Middle East and North Africa. “We’re turning data into decisions and decisions into impact,” said Basma Rady, Chief Data Scientist at Beltone and Managing Director of Robin.

Robin’s offerings include real-time market monitoring tools, intelligent dashboards, predictive analytics, and automated strategic reporting. These tools are designed to enhance operational efficiency, support data-driven decision-making, and unlock measurable business value.

The company’s team blends deep technical expertise with cross-sector insights to build customized AI solutions. Rady emphasized the unit’s human-first approach: “Transformation begins with people. Our strength lies in the diverse minds behind the innovation.”

Beltone’s broader shift beyond investment banking

The launch of Robin is part of Beltone Holding’s strategic expansion under Khorshid, who has rapidly repositioned the company into one of MENA’s most diversified financial services groups. Since her appointment, Beltone has scaled operations across leasing, factoring, asset management, venture capital, and non-banking financial services (NBFIs).

In Q1 2025, Beltone reported operating revenues of EGP2.8 billion ($56.73 million), more than doubling from EGP1.34 billion ($27.15 million) in Q1 2024, a 111 percent year-on-year growth driven by strong performance in its NBFI and investment banking segments. Net profit reached EGP 703 million ($14.24 million).

Capital infusion and impact investment

Beltone recently secured $20 million from impact-focused funds SANAD and the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to expand access to finance for MSMEs and green energy projects across the region. In addition, the group raised EGP 10.5 billion ($212.7 million) through a highly subscribed capital increase, further fueling its regional expansion strategy.

Both Mixue and Starbucks opened their first stores in China in 1999.
The same process may take much longer for Starbucks’ 7,800 stores in China.
Starbucks China, meanwhile, may be worth several billion dollars, Bloomberg reported in May, citing sources.
As of the end of March the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain was operating 7,758 stores in China.","Fast-food provider Mixue's 2097 success is adding a bitter taste to Starbucks' SBUX attempts to sell a stake in its business in the People's Republic. The Chinese company has grown into the world's biggest food and beverage chain by selling sub-$1 drinks and adapting quickly as domestic consumers spend less. That's hard for the $107 billion premium-brand U.S. coffee icon to compete with.

Both Mixue and Starbucks opened their first stores in China in 1999. For the latter the challenge was to introduce coffee culture to a nation obsessed with tea. This turned out to be a smooth blend. Chinese consumers have become more picky and cost-conscious of late, though, and the Seattle-based heavyweight's market share has dropped to 14% from 34% in 2019, per market data provider Euromonitor.

Starbucks is trying to fight back. It announced its first-ever price cut in China last month, although its offerings are still far more expensive than those from Mixue and other rivals like Luckin Coffee.

But Starbucks cannot compete on pricing alone. Its problems run deeper than that. Amid all the talks about China’s weak consumer demand, some of the best-performing stocks in the past year have been the so-called new consumption plays, which include trendy toy maker Pop Mart International 9992 and handcraft jewellery retailer Laopu Gold 6181. These are brands that resonate deeply with the shifting spending preferences of young Chinese to focus on intangibles such as convenience, experience or personalization.

Mixue’s robust supply chain, for instance, allows it to reduce costs and introduce new beverages – or even new interior designs – to its more than 45,000 outlets within weeks. The same process may take much longer for Starbucks’ 7,800 stores in China. And a similar strategy caused problems at its U.S. stores in the past. Boss Brian Niccol even told shareholders in March that Starbucks can learn from ""several lessons"" in its China supply chain and improve its North American business.

Shareholders have rewarded Mixue's strategy: its market value has soared almost 80% to some $25 billion since its Hong Kong listing in March.

Starbucks China, meanwhile, may be worth several billion dollars, Bloomberg reported in May, citing sources. Its same-store sales have at least levelled off recently, halting the earlier slump. And Niccol has emphasised the need to find ways to grow. That would seem to require having a local partner - and buyer - with a Mixue-style understanding of how to take advantage of China’s new consumer logic.

CONTEXT NEWS

Starbucks has received “a lot of interest” in the sale of a stake in its China business as it explores a partnership with an outside investor to restore growth there, CEO Brian Niccol told the Financial Times in an interview published on June 11. As of the end of March the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain was operating 7,758 stores in China.

Mixue has surpassed Starbucks and McDonald's as the world's largest food and beverage company by store count, with 46,479 in 11 countries by December, according to the bubble tea retailer's listing prospectus.

However, they bounced back and were able to overtake Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in China in 2023 despite being delisted from NASDAQ just three years prior.
In the case of Luckin Coffee it also does not hurt that their drinks in China are generally around 30% cheaper than Starbucks.","It is almost undeniable that when we think coffee shop chain we think of Starbucks. The Seattle based company has managed to become a phenomenon worldwide and has had little competition thanks to its uniform but still tailored approach to coffee (and social media worthy seasonal drinks) but it seems like their supreme reign may be coming to an end, as many people are looking for something different, and that seems to be coming from China. The company Luckin Coffee is still not as well-known, but two locations in Manhattan and they are changing the scene already.

They still would have a very long way to go, as there is a reason why no other chain has overtaken Starbucks in about 40 years, and it is not the quality of the coffee, although that has helped.

The new Starbucks coming straight from China, will they be able to compete?

Luckin Coffee’s history seems familiar when we compare it to the American empire Starbucks, although about 50 years later. Founded in 2017, the coffee shop opened multiple locations in a few short years and was able to survive not just the pandemic, but an additional accounting scandal in 2020 which should have brought the company to its knees. However, they bounced back and were able to overtake Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in China in 2023 despite being delisted from NASDAQ just three years prior.

Part of this is, of course, glocalization, which is not something that is taken seriously despite it being a massive driving force in the market nowadays. Starbucks attempts to force the American standard everywhere it goes, and while it has been well received thanks to the expansion of American culture, as people get used to the novelty, they begin to crave other things that are closer to home. Local chains then get the opportunity to apply some of the expansion techniques but with a local flavor and suddenly they are thriving.

In the case of Luckin Coffee it also does not hurt that their drinks in China are generally around 30% cheaper than Starbucks. This is managed by using a mobile-app-based store model, which has allowed them to cut costs while maintaining quality, but the model may not translate as well as they hope into the US market.

There are two strikes working against them in this transition to the US market. The first one is that it seems like they will not be able to offer their products at the same price differential than in China, and the fact hat the products will only be marginally cheaper will likely not help them grow as fast as they expect. The second one is that the app model that they operate with is not exactly something they can do in the States, as in New York, cashless businesses have been prohibited since 2020.

While in China the cashier less experience is one of the features of the company, which can make clients feel less awkward, in the US that will not be an option, and the ambiance is not the same. Even so, the app remains central to the company’s U.S. strategy.

In its two New York locations, users have been offered their first beverage for just $1.99 and the chance to win a year’s worth of free coffee through a raffle. Those who downloaded the app ahead of the opening also gained early access to limited-time deals. The company is also taking advantage of their Social Media savviness and have recently opened a new account specifically for the American market where they will undoubtedly publish new trends and discounts for their potential and current customers to benefit from.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/luckin-coffee-starbucks-china.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:13:08.227335

Lloyds topped the list at £12.6m, with Barclays second at just short of £9m, official figures seen by City AM show.
This came as the motor finance row, which Lloyds and Barclays have historical exposure to, dragged total complaints to the FOS to the highest levels since the PPI scandal.
The regulator said the increase had mainly been focused on credit affordability and car finance complaints.","Lloyds and Barclays were among top UK banking giants paying millions to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) in administrative fees in the last year.

The banking industry’s ‘Big Six’ – Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Natwest, Santander and Nationwide – paid the FOS a combined £38.8m in admin fees for the year ending March 31.

Lloyds topped the list at £12.6m, with Barclays second at just short of £9m, official figures seen by City AM show.

This came as the motor finance row, which Lloyds and Barclays have historical exposure to, dragged total complaints to the FOS to the highest levels since the PPI scandal.

Motor finance complaints jumped by near-500 per cent to north of 70,000 which triggered an over 50 per cent spike in the FOS’ total caseload to 305,726.

The Supreme Court is expected to give its verdict on whether it was unlawful for banks to pay a commission to a car dealer without the customer’s informed consent in the summer.

Lloyds leads the pack for deepest provisions at £1.2bn, with Barclays setting aside £90 and Close Brothers £165m

Analysts have warned the sector’s total payout for the scandal could top £30bn.

Santander, which has reserved £295m for car finance payouts, faced a surge in provisions in its first-quarter report in April. The Spanish-based lender recorded a 69 per cent increase to £140m for liabilites and charges.

The bank said £42m was driven by “charges relating to changes to our branch network”. The lender is set to close 95 branches this year.

Santander paid £5.14m in FOS admin fees for the financial year.

FOS faces crackdown

City minister Emma Reynolds has remained open to clipping the wings of the ombudsman after accusations the watchdog had become a quasi-regulator.

Reynolds told an audience of bankers and investors that the end of a review on the FOS could lead to a winding down of powers.

Banking officials have hoped the Chancellor will use the July 15 Mansion House speech to introduce a series of reforms to the sector, particularly around regulation.

The FOS introduced changes to its administrative fees system in April with it beginning to charge professional representatives £250 for each case referred to the FOS beyond the first ten cases per financial year.

The new system will also not charge banks for the first three complaints they receive in the financial year. From the fourth complaint forward a case fee of £650 is applied, but reduced to £475 if the complaint is dismissed, withdrawn, or abandoned, or if it is found to be outside the FOS’ jurisdiction.

Banking industry body UK Finance had previously sounded the alarm on the FOS fees system and said it opened the door to penalising firms “disproportionately, particularly in the context of mass-generated complaints driven by professional representatives”.

The European Commission said EU AI laws would be rolled out on schedule, after tech companies in Europe and abroad had called for delays of years while criticising the rules as onerous.

“Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock. There is no grace period. There is no pause,” Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier told a press conference.

“We have legal deadlines established in a legal text,” he said, recapping that some provisions began in February, with obligations for general purpose AI models beginning in August and obligations for high-risk models beginning in August 2026.

Simplification

The Commission has said it plans to submit proposals for simplifying the rules, such as reducing reporting obligations for small companies, toward the end of this year.

European companies including chip manufacturing tools maker ASML, aerospace firm Airbus and AI start-up Mistral were amongst 45 organisations who signed a letter last week asking EU president Ursula von der Leyen to postpone rules targeting the most powerful AI models and calling for a more “innovation-friendly” regulatory approach.

The letter called for the EU to show that it is “serious” about simplifying AI rules and boosting competitiveness in the sector.

Other signatories included Mercedes-Benz Group, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Lufthansa, Publicis Groupe, Prosus and Siemens Energy.

They called for delays to rules targeting general-purpose and high-risk AI models.

The EU promised a code of practice for May but code has been delayed, and in the meantime has been criticised by tech companies and the US government.

AI regulations

The AI Act requires developers to provide information about how their models are trained and to have policies in place that comply with copyright law.

Facebook parent Meta said in February that the draft code of practice was “unworkable” and that the company wouldn’t sign it, while Google has criticised upcoming requirements for third-party AI testing and copyright compliance.",https://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/programming-jobs-computers-ai-artificial-intelligence.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:12:25.094577

PARP inhibitors are already approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but J&J is currently in pole position in the bid to advance their use in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), thanks to a positive readout from the AMPLITUDE study reported at this year's ASCO congress.
J&J has rights to niraparib in prostate cancer, and views the drug as a successor to Zytiga, once a $2.5 billion-a-year blockbuster, which has been hit by generic competition and saw sales fall nearly 29% to $631 million last year.
With its new filing, J&J seems to have set aside concerns about activity in non-BRCA patients, submitting Akeega for approval with a broad HRR-positive label claim.
AstraZeneca currently leads the PAP market with MSD-partnered Lynparza (olaparib), but is developing a next-generation PARP1 inhibitor, saruparib, for HRR-mutated mCSPC patients in the phase 3 EvoPAR-PR01 trial.","Johnson & Johnson's fixed-dose combination of a PARP inhibitor and anti-androgen therapy, Akeega, has been filed for a new indication in prostate cancer that could broaden use of the drug into hormone-sensitive disease.

PARP inhibitors are already approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but J&J is currently in pole position in the bid to advance their use in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), thanks to a positive readout from the AMPLITUDE study reported at this year's ASCO congress.

Akeega, which combines the active ingredients in GSK's PARP inhibitor Zejula (niraparib) and J&J's androgen blocker Zytiga (abiraterone), has been submitted for approval in the EU, its first regulatory filing for the new indication.

The drug has been approved for mCRPC since 2023, and while sales are not yet being broken out by J&J, it has been tipped by GlobalData to reach annual revenues of around $676 million by the end of the decade – assuming it gets approval as the first PARP inhibitor for mCSPC.

J&J has rights to niraparib in prostate cancer, and views the drug as a successor to Zytiga, once a $2.5 billion-a-year blockbuster, which has been hit by generic competition and saw sales fall nearly 29% to $631 million last year.

AMPLITUDE enrolled mCSPC patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations, and showed that Akeega significantly reduced the risk of tumour progression or death by 37% compared to Zytiga, both given on top of prednisone or prednisolone. There was also a trend to improved overall survival – a 25% gain for BRCA patients and 21% for the overall group – which is being tracked to see if it becomes significant with further follow-up.

When the results were released at ASCO, there was some debate about whether J&J would be able to file for approval on the strength of the study, as there was a disparity in the data between two patient subgroups – those with and without BRCA mutations

The greatest benefit was observed in the BRCA-positive subgroup, with a 48% reduction in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), which decreased to approximately 20% in non-BRCA patients.

At ASCO, AMPLITUDE lead investigator Gerhardt Attard of University College London (UCL) said the non-HRR result showed clear efficacy, but also exposed the highly heterogeneous nature of HRR-positive mCSPC, which also includes mutations in other genes like CHEK2 and PALB2, that can lead to diverse responses to therapies.

With its new filing, J&J seems to have set aside concerns about activity in non-BRCA patients, submitting Akeega for approval with a broad HRR-positive label claim.

Competition from other PARP inhibitors in mCSPC could be on the way, though. AstraZeneca currently leads the PAP market with MSD-partnered Lynparza (olaparib), but is developing a next-generation PARP1 inhibitor, saruparib, for HRR-mutated mCSPC patients in the phase 3 EvoPAR-PR01 trial.

Meanwhile, Pfizer's Talzenna (talazoparib) is in the late-stage TALAPRO-3 study in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide) as a treatment for patients with DNA damage response-deficient mCSPC.",https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/2025-07/JandJ_signage_1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:09:54.326498

Since around 2010, major blockbusters including Boehringer Ingelheim International’s Flomax, Pfizer’s Lipitor, and Merck’s Cozaar/Hyzaar have all lost market exclusivity.
Although both are forecast to remain in the top 10 selling drugs in 2030, their revenue is expected to decline.
While several blockbuster drugs are set to lose market exclusivity, only a few big pharma companies are positioned to grow revenue sustainably through 2030.
El-Helou adds: “To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies to offset losses and strengthen their long-term position.","The pharmaceutical industry is bracing for one of its most financially significant patent cliffs in over a decade, with multiple blockbuster drugs set to lose exclusivity by 2030. As biosimilars and generics flood the market, pricing pressures will intensify—particularly in oncology—challenging pharma companies to rethink revenue strategies, pipeline investments, and lifecycle management to safeguard long-term growth, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

Since around 2010, major blockbusters including Boehringer Ingelheim International’s Flomax, Pfizer’s Lipitor, and Merck’s Cozaar/Hyzaar have all lost market exclusivity.

According to GlobalData’s latest report, “Blockbuster Drugs on Patent Cliffs,” there is set to be a smaller proportion of global drug sales which will have patent protection in 2030, a sharp drop compared to previous years. As patents expire, the number of biosimilars and generics entering the market will increase, and subsequently originator pharma companies are going to be faced with aggressive pricing competition. As a result, the US market is set to lose over $230 billion between 2025 and 2030.

One of the key therapy areas that will be affected is oncology, with major drugs including Merck’s Keytruda and Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex/Faspro both losing US exclusivity by 2029. Both drugs were among the top selling drugs in 2024, with Keytruda leading by generating over $29 billion. Although both are forecast to remain in the top 10 selling drugs in 2030, their revenue is expected to decline.

While several blockbuster drugs are set to lose market exclusivity, only a few big pharma companies are positioned to grow revenue sustainably through 2030.

George El-Helou, Strategic Intelligence Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “More than half of the top 15 pharma companies are expected to face challenges in managing the impact of the upcoming patent cliff. However, some companies have pipeline drugs forecast to offset part of these losses.”

Bristol Myers Squibb is among the companies expected to be hit hardest by the upcoming patent cliff, with two major blockbuster drugs, Eliquis and Opdivo, losing exclusivity. These drugs accounted for a significant share of the company’s 2024 revenue, and their patent expirations could significantly weaken its overall financial performance.

El-Helou adds: “To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies to offset losses and strengthen their long-term position. These may include acquiring early-stage biotechs developing promising therapies and increasing investment in R&D, targeting diseases with high unmet needs. Additionally, life cycle management and patent thickets can be effective tools to extend market exclusivity and defend against generic competition.”

Strategies to manage loss of exclusivity need to be considered early on in development, with effective portfolio management which plays a critical role.

Hannah Hans, Head of Pharma Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData, comments: “It is critical to plan from both a patent and regulatory perspective, while also embedding lifecycle management strategies early on in development. This integrated approach will help optimize long term value.”

The current patent cliff implications on pharma companies include loss of revenue and pricing pressures, however there are several opportunities for companies to focus on innovative therapies and re-defining their portfolio.

Hans concludes: “This opens up a significant opportunity for biotech companies to partner with pharma on next generation therapies, novel delivery platforms and differentiated formulations as companies look to strengthen their pipeline.”",https://www.pharmalive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cliff-mountain.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:11:09.009094

Launching today (7 July) during the UK’s Youth Employment Week, the company is opening applications for its Accelerated Leadership Programme, a fast-track route from entry level to store manager in just 13 months, a journey that would typically take around three years.

This year’s programme will recruit over 20 participants. No previous hospitality or work experience is required; just passion, potential, and a drive to grow. Training for each participant is free, with Starbucks investing £5,000 (£100,000 in total) in their professional development, helping to set them up for success in the early stages of their career.Whilst the programme offers trainees the opportunity to grow and accelerate their career within Starbucks, the skills gained are designed to open doors wherever their journey leads. There’s no requirement to stay with the company for any length of time, nor are any of the costs of training required to be repaid.

Throughout the programme, delivered by Starbucks training partner Corndel, participants will gain hands-on experience in stores and learn about every aspect needed to become a successful, well-rounded hospitality manager, as well as gaining a professional accreditation from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).Across the 13 months, participants will:

Gain essential hands-on in-store experience

Build core leadership and team management skills

Strengthen their commercial and strategic understanding

Develop their decision-making

Improve their time management skills

Learn how to deliver standout customer experience

Understand how to resolve conflict and deescalate

Have the opportunity to network with existing partners across the UKThey’ll graduate with a Level 3 apprenticeship qualification (equivalent to an A Level), fully equipping them for a role as a Starbucks store manager by the end of the programme.This is the second intake for the newly formed Accelerated Leadership Programme, with 14 partners currently progressing through the scheme after the first round of applications opened earlier this year in April. In total, Starbucks will invest more than £170,000 across the two cohorts.

Alex Rayner, General Manager, Starbucks UK said: “We’re delighted to open further applications for our Accelerated Leadership Programme. Our success starts and ends with our Green Apron Partners and whether you’re just leaving school or exploring a fresh start, Starbucks is a place where you can be yourself, work with great people, craft your path and spread joy every day through the power of coffee.”

Reina, a Green Apron Partner who is currently enrolled in the scheme, said: “When my manager suggested I should apply to the Accelerated Leadership Programme, I was excited to try something new. My favourite lesson so far has been learning about happiness at work – things like managing your time or finding strategies to improve your wellbeing. I didn’t realise that would be something we’d be taught as store managers, but it is important – for ourselves and our team. I don’t know what the future holds for me but now I’ll have the skills to succeed no matter where life takes me.”

The initiative is part of Starbucks UK’s ongoing commitment to provide young people with meaningful career opportunities. It runs alongside a year-round apprenticeship scheme offering 150 new roles across the business, from entry-level baristas to degree-level positions in the support centre.Applications open on 7 July and close on 21 July.

The deal equips Capgemini to create a consulting business service focused on helping companies improve their processes and cost efficiency with the use of artificial intelligence, namely generative AI and agentic AI, which it expects to attract significant investments.

The purchase price translating to $76.50 per WNS share represents a 17% premium compared to their last closing price on July 3 and does not include WNS’s financial debt, Capgemini said.

“WNS brings … its high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services … while further increasing our exposure to the US market,” Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said in a press statement.

WNS’s customers include large organizations such as Coca-Cola, T-Mobile and United Airlines.

On a conference call with media and analysts, Ezzat said the acquisition would immediately create cross-selling opportunities between the two companies, mainly in the U.S. and Britain.

Capgemini expects the deal to be closed by the end of 2025 and be immediately accretive to its revenue and operating margin.

However, its shares fell around 5% following the news, the biggest losers on Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index as of 1024 GMT, with Morgan Stanley analysts saying the deal would limit its balance sheet flexibility while not having a major impact on financials.

Some investors are also concerned that Gen AI could impact the typically staff-intensive business process outsourcing (BPO) market, which could bite into Capgemini’s revenues and expose it to new competition, the analysts said in a research note.

A massive advertisement featuring the Indiana Fever guard now adorns the JW Marriott building in downtown Indianapolis, just in time for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Weekend.

The ad, which showcases Clark mid-shot with the tagline “From downtown in my town,” is a record-breaking installation, covering nearly the entire building.

This striking visual not only welcomes fans to Indianapolis but also celebrates Clark’s impact on the sport.

The ad has been confirmed as the largest sports graphic ever installed on the JW Marriott, a testament to Clark’s growing influence both on and off the court.

That follows the NCAA March Madness bracket being on their when the tournament was hosted strictly in Indianapolis due to Covid-19 restrictions.

Fans have been buzzing about the ad’s sheer size and bold design, with one commenter likening it to “a giant cereal box.” Another fan shared, “Literal chills every time I walk past.”

The timing of the ad’s unveiling is significant, as the WNBA All-Star Game is set to take place in Indianapolis on July 19.

However, Clark’s participation remains uncertain due to a groin injury that has sidelined her for five games.

What happens with prices after the summer sales events is anyone’s guess.
Home Depot and Target saw the most price hikes, affecting 39% and 37%, respectively, of those tracked since March.
At Amazon, by contrast, just one of seven toys saw price hikes, and all six apparel purchases held flat.","This summer’s big sales events could offer some of the best bargains before the ongoing trade war threatens to scramble fall and winter shopping.

President Donald Trump’s springtime pause on his sweeping global tariffs is set to expire Wednesday. He has indicated the July 9 deadline isn’t set in stone, and his treasury secretary said Sunday that higher rates would kick in Aug. 1 if agreements aren’t reached by then. So without a flurry of trade deals with dozens of countries in the coming weeks, the import taxes are set to drive up the prices of numerous overseas goods for businesses and consumers alike.

In the meantime, major retailers are rolling out deep midseason discounts to keep customers spending despite widespread pessimism. Consumer sentiment has improved from its dismal levels months ago but remains sharply lower than this time last year. The promotions could run as much as 40% off during Home Depot’s 4th of July Sale (June 19-July 9), Target’s Circle Week (July 6-12) and Best Buy’s Black Friday in July Sale (July 7-13), and up to 50% off during Amazon Prime Day (July 8-11) and Walmart Deals (July 8-13).

What happens with prices after the summer sales events is anyone’s guess. Retail executives, including at Walmart, and major consumer brands have warned that tariff-fueled price increases are likely as the year wears on and the inventories they’ve built up dwindle. Some analysts are already seeing signs of those hikes picking up, particularly at department stores, CNBC reported last week.

To reduce some of the guesswork for shoppers, NBC News is tracking online price levels for dozens of items at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Home Depot to determine when and how much they may fluctuate throughout the rest of the year.

Rather than sweep up hundreds or thousands of items across these retailers’ sprawling e-commerce marketplaces, the tracker zeroes in on a basket of 230 items that tend to be purchased less frequently than, say, groceries or household staples. They range from appliances like dishwashers and toasters to jewelry, smartphones and running shoes.

The NBC News Price Tracker is powered by the e-commerce price-tracking platform Bright Data, which is monitoring 27 to 61 items for each of the five retailers.

The Price Tracker can’t identify what causes prices to rise or fall, so it’s impossible to determine whether any changes reflect retailers passing along tariff expenses to shoppers. But the tool can help consumers plan their purchases at a time when goods from certain countries, such as China, or with specific components, like steel or aluminum, are disproportionately subject to steeper levies.

The summer sales period offers something of a starting line, coinciding with broader trade policy changes and representing the last major discounting spree before back-to-school shopping around Labor Day, followed by early-bird holiday sales leading up to Black Friday.

Since Bright Data began tracking prices of 230 items for NBC News on March 2, about 29% of them saw price hikes, with an average increase of nearly 6%. Home Depot and Target saw the most price hikes, affecting 39% and 37%, respectively, of those tracked since March. And over roughly the last month, price increases have been more common than reductions: In all but one week since May 30, twice as many products increased in price than decreased across the four major retailers.

(A Home Depot spokesperson said the company hasn’t taken tariff-related pricing actions and attributed any price swings to routine promotional cycles. Target didn’t comment.)

So far, there are few signs of broad-based pricing changes that clearly correspond to tariff policy moves.

“It’s been hard to draw a line connecting the dots between things that have been said, things that are happening in the world, and certain items that we know are manufactured in those areas,” said Jennifer Burns, Bright Data’s director of public relations and communications.

But a few patterns are emerging in the run-up to this month’s discounting sprees:

Kitchen appliances: It might not be the best time to make major upgrades in the kitchen. Prices on larger appliances like freezers, stoves and ovens are up, particularly at Home Depot, where 39% of the items we tracked increased in price. The highest individual price increase was 53.1% on a freezer and refrigerator unit. At Best Buy, prices took a sharp dive from mid-April to mid-June but have since rebounded to slightly above their springtime levels.

Water bottles: The prices of three popular stainless-steel water bottles — by Hydro Flask, Stanley and Owala — are each ticking up at Amazon and Walmart, potentially a sign that the 25% tariff on global steel is having an impact. (Owala declined to comment; Hydro Flask and Stanley didn’t respond to requests for comment.)

Electronics: Smartphones saw a sharp price spike, increasing by an average of 15% at Best Buy, but other gadgets such as speakers, headphones and accessories like charging docks stayed flat across the five retailers. (A Best Buy spokesperson said the retailer offers high-quality tech at a range of competitive price points that can fluctuate for reasons including sales, seasonality and device upgrade cycles.)

Apparel: Clothing price changes vary by retailer. In May, Walmart warned shoppers could start seeing tariff-driven price hikes within weeks, and apparel is one of several areas where that may be happening. Of the six clothing items NBC News is tracking at Walmart, four saw price hikes — together rising by an average of more than 57% over the past month. Four of the six Walmart toys NBC News tracked got pricier, up 37% during the same period. At Amazon, by contrast, just one of seven toys saw price hikes, and all six apparel purchases held flat. (A Walmart spokesperson said the company aims to “keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can.” An Amazon spokesperson said the retailer offers industry-leading low prices across hundreds of millions of items and pointed to CEO Andy Jassy’s recent remarks on CNBC that the company has “so far not seen prices appreciably go up.”)

Beauty and jewelry: These prices largely haven’t changed, despite 30% tariffs on goods imported from China, where many such products are made.

Economists warn that consumers haven’t felt the full weight of tariffs at checkout just yet.

“I expect the inflation associated with tariffs to be felt later this year,” the National Retail Federation’s chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz, said in a press release last month. “Consumers remain very price sensitive, and those costs are likely to weigh heavily on consumer budgets.”

But fluctuating prices aren’t expected to deter people from chasing summer deals. Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce spending, projects consumers will shell out $23.8 billion online from Tuesday to Friday — up $9.6 billion from last year’s summer sales.

“You have some consumers who just see really strong deals, and that’s enticing enough for them to do that spontaneous purchasing,” said Vivek Pandya, lead digital analyst at Adobe. “You also have consumers who are cognizant of the broader pricing environment globally, and are kind of trying to stockpile goods in anticipation.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250703-Amazon-package-aa-1221-39bb6d.jpg",N,,2025-07-07 13:15:06.122370

Despite challenges encountered along the way, Best Buy's procurement transformation stands as a compelling example of how procurement can evolve from a transactional function into a strategic business enabler.","Best Buy stands as a major player in the consumer electronics retail space, generating over US$40bn in annual revenue. While its core activity and brand recognition are strongest across North America, the company also maintains operations in India and China.

Beyond its traditional retail footprint, Best Buy is actively expanding its business model.

""We are an organisation that's focused on expanding its footprint beyond traditional retail,"" explains Anna Barej, Vice President of Procurement at Best Buy.

""Best Buy is heavily focused on growing our retail media presence like many other retailers in the industry. We’re also focusing on elevating our omnichannel experience and introducing marketplace as a virtual shopping mall for our customers”

These strategic growth initiatives require significant procurement support, positioning the function as a critical enabler of the company's future success. The procurement team at Best Buy is now at the heart of driving the company forward following a successful transformation mission – spearheaded by Anna.

From reactive to strategic: The procurement transformation journey

When Anna joined Best Buy in 2021, she inherited a procurement function that was fundamentally transactional in nature. While the team was competent in executing core sourcing and contracting activities, it lacked the strategic vision and capabilities needed to drive competitive advantage.

""I was recruited to transform the organisation,"" she explains. ""The organisation at that point in time was more of a reactive, transactional team who did really good work servicing the business. What was missing was innovation and insights that enabled our businesses to actually have a competitive advantage.""

Anna’s mandate was clear: transform procurement from a reactive function into a strategic partner through improvements in people, processes and technology. This comprehensive transformation would require significant changes to how the function operated, from redefining its core value proposition to revolutionising its technological infrastructure.

Redefining procurement value

The first and perhaps most critical step in Best Buy's procurement transformation, labelled ‘Propel’, was redefining what value meant for the function.

While cost optimisation remained a core objective with specific targets, the transformation expanded procurement's value proposition significantly.

""The traditional definition of procurement value is cost transformation and cost optimisation,"" Anna shares. ""That, for us, is still one of our goals and we are measured against it, but we're not doing that at the cost of trade-offs.”

“We want to make sure we provide spent optimisation for quality and for benefit to the business, but that’s only a very small sliver of what we do.""

Best Buy's procurement team now delivers value through strategic insights, innovation, technology enablement and building genuine strategic partnerships – rather than managing transactional engagements. This comprehensive value proposition has become the foundation of the function's new identity.

“Value was definitely the first thing we needed to redefine,” Anna emphasises.

Managing change

While technology and processes were critical components of the transformation, Anna found people and change management to be the most challenging aspects of the journey.

The scale of change required was significant and not everyone was prepared to embrace the new direction.

""Change is the hardest part of transformation,"" Anna reflects. ""I've answered this question quite frequently, ‘what was your biggest challenge?’. It was people’s reaction to and embrace of change.""

The transformation initially triggered some major shifts, with some team members who weren't aligned with the new vision opting to depart Best Buy.

While challenging, Anna views this as ultimately beneficial for both the individuals and the function.

She continues: “We had significant turnover during the first two years of the transformation, primarily because many individuals didn't necessarily believe in the future or they weren't comfortable with the approach, so they self-selected themselves out of the organisation.

“Ultimately, I think that was a good thing – for them and for us.""

Successful change management required a dramatically different leadership approach, focused on keeping team members informed and involved in decision-making, as well as providing them with genuine ownership of the transformation journey.

Anna adds: ""The approach to change management required a very different way of working on my part and on my leadership team's part. We focused on ensuring our team played a role in the transformation, leading change versus being expected to only react to it.”.""

Technology as a transformation enabler

Best Buy's procurement transformation has been heavily enabled by technology, with solutions from multiple partners, including SpendHQ, playing crucial roles.

A particularly challenging aspect was consolidating data from dozens of disparate legacy systems into a unified view.

Anna was faced with taking 38 systems which had existed in the legacy environment and folding most of that data into one view - something she has described as being “a tremendous benefit for the whole company""

""SpendHQ has been a great partner for us,"" Anna notes. ""They are providing us with procurement and performance management capability, a tool we use to manage all our initiatives, from intake to forecasting and planning and reporting.""

“SpendHQ sits at the center of everything we do and allows us to manage all our work in one place. It's a great way for category managers and their leaders to track progress, provide forecasts, prioritise work and manage workload.""

The technology transformation has delivered significant benefits, particularly in terms of data visibility and decision-making capabilities. This has elevated procurement's standing within the organisation and enabled more strategic conversations with business leaders.

""The primary benefit that I see is the ability to provide full visibility into data,"" Anna explains.

""Digitising all of our spend and all of our procurement activities is helping us to not just make better decisions and plan more effectively but is truly helping the enterprise understand how they behave.""

Measurable results and strategic impact

Best Buy's procurement transformation has delivered impressive quantifiable results, with Anna helping to double procurement’s financial contributions within the first year of the Propel program.

""What we delivered to the enterprise doubled during the initial couple of years and we're keeping that momentum going,” says Anna. “It's been sustained by the transformation.”

However, the strategic impact extends far beyond financial metrics. The transformation has fundamentally changed how the procurement function is perceived within the organisation, creating deeper partnerships with business stakeholders and enabling procurement to influence strategic decisions.

The cultural shift has opened new opportunities for procurement to contribute.

""Stakeholders begin to reach out differently,” Anna explains. “They begin to ask different questions, which allows us, in turn, to insert ourselves into the most critical moments of opportunity.

""The partnership elevated us to a different level, unlocking opportunities and literally unlocking rooms for us. We began being invited into business strategy sessions and long-term planning sessions – now that is a significant pivot from the reactive role that we once played.""

Expanding beyond traditional procurement boundaries

Perhaps the most significant indicator of procurement's elevated status is that it has been asked to expand beyond its traditional remit.

The function now plays a central role in driving optimisation.

""Our recent success in delivering incremental value and providing new levels of data visibility to the enterprise has resulted in expansion of our role to include facilitation of operating income optimisation efforts for the company,"" Anna reveals.

""Procurement has been asked to integrate commercial and business operational efficiency strategies into one enterprise governance process. This approach enables visibility to all opportunities for allocation decisions in growth priorities.

""Being a lever of insights and information in a very proactive structured way is driving different levels of discussions and enabling us to be at the forefront of growth through reinvestment strategies,"" celebrates Anna.

""I'm very proud that procurement is not only contributing to the bottom line, but ultimately top-line growth as well.""

Key victories and lessons learned

Reflecting on the transformation journey, Anna identifies three significant achievements:

Redefining procurement's value proposition and becoming a genuine strategic partner to the business.

Building an entrepreneurial culture within procurement that encourages innovation and constructive challenge.

Expanding beyond traditional procurement boundaries to directly contribute to Best Buy's growth strategies.

However, given the chance to do it all again, Anna admits she would have paid more attention to change management: ""I would definitely pay more attention upfront to the change aspect and how people react to it.

""I assumed that, if I were to communicate effectively multiple times, it would be enough. But what I've learned over time is that you have to dedicate much more time to the change conversation.

""You need to have different types of conversations with a variety of audiences. Some people require more attention than others. The differences in approach to change really have to be top of mind. I have not seen a standard playbook that works for all. Considering current state organisational culture, level of functional maturity and differences in how individuals process information are critical and require time to execute effectively.""

The evolution continues

While the Propel transformation program is nearing completion, Anna is clear in her belief that the evolution must continue: “The Propel transformation may soon be complete, but the spirit of transformation will not go away. It will change to an ongoing capability evolution. Propel helped us create a culture comfortable with change and challenges.

Her team is now focused on new opportunities, including leveraging AI, expanding their supplier relationship management capabilities and continuing to build on their operating income optimisation role.

""The idea is that we should never lose the transformational mindset. We must always be challenging ourselves to do things differently, more efficiently for better outcomes, focusing on creating competitive advantage for the company"" Anna concludes.

Despite challenges encountered along the way, Best Buy's procurement transformation stands as a compelling example of how procurement can evolve from a transactional function into a strategic business enabler.

Analysts expect health insurers to find it more difficult to keep Americans signed up for Medicaid and ACA plans because the Trump-approved bill requires more eligibility checks and bureaucratic hurdles.
AHIP represents some of the biggest providers of individual coverage including Centene, Oscar Health, Elevance Health, Cigna and an array of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
In Centene’s case, the actuarial firm Wakely found subscribers to ACA plans, also known as Obamacare, were sicker and needed more healthcare services that what the company planned for.
Mizuho’s Hynes is already hinting Centene will “reprice” its 2026 plans and they will be more expensive for buyers.","The problems Centene appears to be having managing the costs of low-income Americans covered by Medicaid and individual plans under the Affordable Care Act could only be the beginning of what’s to come for more health insurers.

Centene last week pulled its financial forecast for the rest of this year after an outside firm’s review of data that showed subscribers in its ACA plans are sicker and need more care than the company anticipated. In addition, Centene is also seeing higher cost trends in its Medicaid business -- coverage for low-income Americans the insurer helps more than two dozen states manage.

In the future, the management of Medicaid patients may get even trickier for health insurers after President Donald Trump last week signed into law legislation that cuts $1 trillion from Medicaid and ACA plans that is expected to eliminate coverage for nearly 12 million Americans over the next decade, data from the Congressional Budget Office shows.

Analysts expect health insurers to find it more difficult to keep Americans signed up for Medicaid and ACA plans because the Trump-approved bill requires more eligibility checks and bureaucratic hurdles. These eligibility checks in the Medicaid program are called “redeterminations” and they are already to blame for millions of Americans falling off of Medicaid coverage following the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2023.

“Due to new red tape and barriers to enrollment and re-enrollment, people losing eligibility for Medicaid will find an individual market with less choice and higher premiums,” the trade group and lobby America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) said. AHIP represents some of the biggest providers of individual coverage including Centene, Oscar Health, Elevance Health, Cigna and an array of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.

In the individual market, millions more Americans face the possibility of losing coverage because the legislation written by Republicans in Congress doesn’t extend tax credits signed into law by former President Joe Biden beyond this year. As the bill Trump signed into law takes effect, the reduced spending on these tax credits, or subsidies, means buyers of ACA plans will face higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.

In Centene’s case, the actuarial firm Wakely found subscribers to ACA plans, also known as Obamacare, were sicker and needed more healthcare services that what the company planned for.

“We believe a key issue could be a structural shift in the cost profile of the (ACA health insurance exchange) population due to Medicaid Redeterminations,” Ann Hynes and colleagues at Mizuho Securities USA wrote in a report last week. “We would not be buyers on weakness and look for increased clarity on Centene's ability to reprice (health insurance exchange plans) for 2026 and increased visibility on the extent of Medicaid (medical loss ratio) pressures.”

Analysts see sicker patients buying health plans while healthier people will go without, leaving the risk pools filled with those needing more services, costing health insurers even more. Mizuho’s Hynes is already hinting Centene will “reprice” its 2026 plans and they will be more expensive for buyers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68682d117531d6751f428003/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-07 09:09:28.133813

Inforum, a professional development organization for women, has evolved since it was founded in 1962 as the Women's Economic Club.
Under Barclay's leadership, the organization shifted from a 501(c)6 membership nonprofit — the Women’s Economic Club — to a 501(c)3 education and research nonprofit now operating as Inforum.
You know, they want to have the very best people working at their companies, and our goal was to make those opportunities accessible to qualified women,” Barclay said.
Beyond Inforum’s programs, Barclay recalled invitations to edit women's leadership books and once, to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.","The Inforum Board of Directors began succession planning a year ago, Barclay said, noting there are internal candidates for the position. But the search will also expand to include external candidates, with the goal of naming her successor by the year’s end. An interim leader will be named if needed.

The time is right to depart, Barclay said.

Inforum has strong leadership and is in a strong financial position with $3.8 million in assets at the end of last year, one of her proudest accomplishments. The assets helped the organization weather the Great Recession of 2008 and the three-year COVID-19 pandemic.

“When I arrived back in ‘01 there was really no cash reserve, and so we've built up over time because of our business model and our work,” she said.

Inforum, a professional development organization for women, has evolved since it was founded in 1962 as the Women's Economic Club.

Under Barclay's leadership, the organization shifted from a 501(c)6 membership nonprofit — the Women’s Economic Club — to a 501(c)3 education and research nonprofit now operating as Inforum.

That enabled it to seek and receive donations and grants from private and corporate foundations to grow its leadership development programs, in-demand networking events and other efforts like the Michigan Women’s Leadership Report, which tracks the representation of women in top roles on the boards and in the C-suite of Michigan’s public companies.

“Our focus has always been on supporting companies in their war for talent. You know, they want to have the very best people working at their companies, and our goal was to make those opportunities accessible to qualified women,” Barclay said. “Forming the 501(c)3 allowed us to raise the revenue to do that.”

Over the past 20 years, Inforum has served more than 12,000 women and men through its leadership development programs.

Inforum reported $2.18 million in total revenue and an operating loss of just over $93,000 on its 2024 990 form filed with the Internal Revenue Service, with slightly less revenue year over year and an increase in compensation costs.

Beyond Inforum’s programs, Barclay recalled invitations to edit women's leadership books and once, to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.

It feels like the right time to pursue other interests, like her service on the boards of the Nature Conservancy of Michigan, where she serves as vice chair, and on the boards of the Cranbrook Education Community and Cranbrook Institute of Science, Barclay said.

(MOH) today announced preliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2025 and updated its full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance. The Company’s announcement of preliminary results was driven by recent market dynamics and off-cycle disclosures from others in the managed health care sector.

The Company now expects its second quarter 2025 adjusted earnings to be approximately $5.50 per share(1), which is modestly below its prior expectations. This preliminary result reflects medical cost pressures in all three lines of business. The Company expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year. As a result, the Company now expects its full year 2025 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share(1), reflecting a consolidated pre-tax margin of just under 4%, the low-end of its long-term guidance range.

“The short-term earnings pressure we are experiencing results from what we believe to be a temporary dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend which has recently accelerated,” said Joseph Zubretsky, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As we are still performing near our long-term target ranges, nothing, including the potential impacts of the budget bill, has changed our outlook for the long-term performance of the business.”

As previously announced, the Company expects to report its full second quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the earnings release on Thursday, July 24, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The fashion retailer told The Mail on Sunday that it is testing the technology in one store in Edinburgh and two in London.

“We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers,” an H&M spokesperson told This is Money over the weekend.

The move comes as retailers across the UK explore a range of security measures to tackling rising retail crime.

In May, Currys has announced its largest ever investment in in-store security with the rollout of headsets at stores nationwide.

The move follows a successful trial of the VoCoVo developed technology in 20 stores.

The headsets aim to help staff stay better connected and therefore safer on the shop floor amidst the rise in shoplifting and abuse incidents across the retail industry.

In February, Tesco unveiled a new multimillion-pound security hub in Daventry, Northamptonshire, as part of a major investment to tackle the growing problem of retail crime across its UK stores.

The high-tech centre, which operates 24 hours a day throughout the year, analyses thousands of hours of CCTV footage to target shoplifters and protect staff from violence.

Security operators have been assigned responsibility for monitoring specific groups of stores across the UK.

bp has also rolled out a crime intelligence platform across its 300 company-owned stores and has provided staff with body cameras at 70 locations.

The Auror platform allows the company to gather and share relevant information on retail crime with local police and other retailers.

H&M's trial comes after figures from the British Retail Consortium published in March revealed that nearly a quarter of the UK population have witnessed shoplifting taking place while at a shop in the last 12 months.

The organisation also found that around 23 per cent of customers have seen the physical or verbal abuse of staff including racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.

In January, the BRC’s annual crime survey also found that retail crime is at the highest level on record with losses reaching £2.2 billion.

It also showed that there were over 2,000 incidents of violence and abuse over 2023-2024, more than triple the levels recorded in 2020.

Separately, shopworkers’ union Usdaw, has produced its own research which shows 77 per cent of retail staff experience abuse, with 53 per cent on the receiving end of threats and 10 per cent experiencing assault.",https://www.retail-systems.com/rs/images/H&M Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 10:02:08.438159

In a statement, the pharmacy benefit manager pointed to drug pricing as a central challenge for insurers.
Although Zepbound is being excluded, CVS stated it is continuing to expand access to other weight-loss drugs considered more cost-effective under current insurance models.
Under the deal, CVS became the first retail pharmacy in Novo Nordisk’s pharmacy network, and Wegovy is now available at reduced pricing across 9,000 CVS locations.
Medicare, Medicaid, and many employer-sponsored plans continue to exclude coverage of these drugs due to pricing concerns.","CVS Caremark has removed coverage of Zepbound, a GLP-1 weight-loss drug, citing pricing concerns and shifting payer dynamics that are reshaping how weight-loss treatments are covered under insurance plans, according to a report from AM Best.

In a statement, the pharmacy benefit manager pointed to drug pricing as a central challenge for insurers. “The egregiously high list prices set by drug manufacturers of GLP-1s for weight loss are the single biggest barrier to patient access,” a CVS spokesperson said. “Many payers, including Medicare and numerous state benefit plans, have declined to cover GLP-1s for weight loss because of the unsustainably high prices set by brand pharma.”

CVS said its updated formulary approach is designed to maintain coverage for treatments it deems clinically appropriate, while also using market competition to manage costs. Although Zepbound is being excluded, CVS stated it is continuing to expand access to other weight-loss drugs considered more cost-effective under current insurance models.

The company declined to say whether its new arrangement with Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy, influenced the Zepbound decision, according to the report.

Under the deal, CVS became the first retail pharmacy in Novo Nordisk’s pharmacy network, and Wegovy is now available at reduced pricing across 9,000 CVS locations. The agreement could offer a pathway for insurers and plan sponsors to control spending while still offering GLP-1 coverage.

The shift comes as insurers and benefit managers reassess how high-cost, high-demand weight-loss drugs fit into long-term coverage strategies. Medicare, Medicaid, and many employer-sponsored plans continue to exclude coverage of these drugs due to pricing concerns.

CVS Health also announced plans to exit the Affordable Care Act individual exchange business, citing ongoing financial underperformance and limited potential for future profitability in that segment.

As of the first quarter of 2025, CVS Health reported net income of $1.78 billion, up from $1.12 billion a year earlier.

The H&M Group joins retailers such as Go Outdoors, Matalan and Tesco in testing bodycams.
That would be linked up “with stronger enforcement against shop theft, against street theft [and] stronger prevention work”.
Cooper said that shop theft and street theft hits at the heart of communities and would be a priority now for policing across the country.
We must stamp out this scourge of crime up and down the country, and this announcement is certainly a step in the right direction.”","The Swedish fashion giant is piloting the technology at stores in Wood Green and Beckton in London, as well as Edinburgh.

According to research by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), shoplifting rose 20% last year, with violent and abusive incidents against staff reaching 2,000 per day.

The H&M Group joins retailers such as Go Outdoors, Matalan and Tesco in testing bodycams.

An H&M spokesperson told Drapers: “We’re testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers.”

The news from H&M follows home secretary Yvette Cooper’s announcement of a summer blitz retail crime last week.

Speaking on the Today programme on 4 July, Cooper said extra neighbourhood patrols would be supported by more than £60m funding for hotspot policing.

That would be linked up “with stronger enforcement against shop theft, against street theft [and] stronger prevention work”.

Cooper said that shop theft and street theft hits at the heart of communities and would be a priority now for policing across the country. “It’s been treated as low level, whereas when it happens in the heart of your community, if it keeps shoppers away, if it makes shop staff feel unsafe, if it means traders just think, I’m not going to operate here anymore, that hits at the very heart of communities.”

Helen Dickinson, CEO, BRC, said at the time of the announcement: “With the huge rise in retail theft and the continued impact of violence and abuse on retail colleagues, we welcome the announcement of increased police patrols and local action to tackle town centre crime and anti-social behaviour. We must stamp out this scourge of crime up and down the country, and this announcement is certainly a step in the right direction.”",https://cdn.rt.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/15074243/HM-3x2.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 10:02:14.961246

The goal is to bring delicious products at great value to more people, a Trader Joe’s spokesperson told the Los Angeles times.
The new Trader Joe’s location is about 40% bigger than its neighbor, also according the report.
Others wished Trader Joe’s would stake a claim in another neighborhood; Trader Joe’s does have plans to open five new stores in California before the end of this year.
Putting consumers first paid off: Trader Joe’s saw the sixth-largest reputation boost (+3.5) this year, moving it to the number-one spot.","Walk down the street in almost any city, and you’ll see the ubiquitous green mermaid logo staring back at you.

In some cities, you'll find her on sidewalks, strip malls, office plazas, and even highway exit ramps, as predictably as street signs.

There are now multiple Starbucks locations within a mile of each other in many U.S. cities. In places like New York, California, and the Pacific Northwest, it seems like there’s one on every corner, probably because there are.

This saturation strategy once fueled explosive growth: by 2017, around 62% of U.S. stores had at least one Starbucks (SBUX) rival right next door, often competing not with Dunkin’ or local cafés, but with themselves.

Some critics have argued for years that this internal competition cannibalized sales, but the omnipresence has been a convenience to countless caffeine seekers. Need a morning latte or an afternoon pick-me-up? Just walk 100 yards.

Starbucks’ growth strategy has always been about presence and dominance. It ensures it’s the most convenient choice, beating local cafés and other chains through sheer availability. It’s kind of a game of real estate chess. Each new store captures more foot traffic and prevents competitors from setting up shop.

Now, Trader Joe’s looks to be experimenting with the same model.

New Trader Joe’s store is across the street from an old one

In a surprising twist on the saturation playbook, Trader Joe’s recently opened a second store in Sherman Oaks, right across the street from the neighborhood’s first location, which opened in 1973.

Dubbed “Sherman Oaks too,” the new branch brings modern upgrades that will make any Trader Joe’s shopper jump for joy: convenient and ample underground parking.

The store also has high ceilings and wider aisles than most other locations, giving it a more modern look.

Rather than retire the older store, Trader Joe’s elected to keep both open, emphasizing customer convenience and store differentiation. The veteran location offers a cozy, nostalgic shopping experience that appeals to long-time fans, while the new site caters to those needing more space and wanting easier parking.

The goal is to bring delicious products at great value to more people, a Trader Joe’s spokesperson told the Los Angeles times.

The new Trader Joe’s location is about 40% bigger than its neighbor, also according the report.

Some customers said that the better parking situation means they will never return to the other location with its “cramped” parking.

Others wished Trader Joe’s would stake a claim in another neighborhood; Trader Joe’s does have plans to open five new stores in California before the end of this year.

Another 16 stores will open in other states before the end of 2025.

Trader Joe's is the most popular grocer in the U.S.

Trader Joe’s may be known for the best snacks and the worst parking, but it also has an enviable reputation among consumers.

With a reputational quotient (RQ) score of 82.1, the beloved grocery chain ​​recently claimed the top spot in the 2025 Axios Harris Corporate Reputation Poll of 100 companies.

Outdoor brand Patagonia came in a close second with an 82.0, followed by big names like Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and Samsung.

The poll gathered insights from over 16,000 Americans, who rated companies across key categories like trust, ethics, culture, and overall customer experience.

Putting consumers first paid off: Trader Joe’s saw the sixth-largest reputation boost (+3.5) this year, moving it to the number-one spot. Consumers clearly appreciate a brand that’s got their back when prices are rising.

Here is the list of all the top 10 brands named in the Axios poll:

Trader Joe’s

Patagonia

Microsoft

Toyota Motor Corp.

Costco

Samsung

Arizona Beverage Company

Nvidia

UPS

Apple

Odds are good that whether you choose an old-school location like the original Sherman Oaks Trader Joe's or head to one of the grocer's newer locations, you'll be greeted by the same cheery crew members the store is known for.

Here's hoping that won't change as the grocer expands.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE0MDg0ODE3NTg1NzEwNTQz/trader-joes-lead.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:13:19.596539

Immediate unlocking of value

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

Intelligent Operations – Agentic AI creates a paradigm shift that opens a strategic opportunity

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labor-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Combining the capabilities and scale required to lead in Intelligent Operations

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai7 to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Value creation

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin6 in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

Smooth integration

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

Key transaction terms and timeline

The contemplated transaction will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under the laws of Jersey. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Capgemini’s and WNS’ Boards of Directors.

The Group plans to r******** the bridge with available cash for around €1.0 billion and the balance by debt issuance.

Q2 and H1 2025 performance

WNS, established in 1996 by British Airways in Mumbai, became an independent company in 2002. It has a strong presence in the US and UK markets. Its client portfolio includes major companies like United Airlines, Aviva, and M&T Bank.

The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Capgemini’s earnings per share by 4% in 2026 and 7% post-synergies in 2027, said the company statement.

This isn't just a tuck-in acquisition—it's a calculated play to accelerate Wabtec's transition into a leader of rail digitization, with immediate EPS accretion and long-term growth potential.

However, Wabtec's track record with past acquisitions—like the 2020 Wilco acquisition, which boosted its aftermarket parts business—gives investors reason to be optimistic.","Wabtec Corporation (WAB) has made its boldest move yet in the rail technology space with its $675 million acquisition of Frauscher Sensor Technology Group, announced July 2, 2025. The deal positions Wabtec to capitalize on surging demand for advanced signaling and sensor systems while bolstering its foothold in critical markets like Europe and India. This isn't just a tuck-in acquisition—it's a calculated play to accelerate Wabtec's transition into a leader of rail digitization, with immediate EPS accretion and long-term growth potential.

The Strategic Imperative: Building a Digital Railroad Empire

Wabtec's move to acquire Frauscher reflects its focus on vertical integration in the rail industry. Frauscher's core technologies—train detection systems, axle counters, and wayside control solutions—are foundational to modern rail safety and efficiency. These systems are critical for managing track occupancy, preventing collisions, and enabling autonomous train operations. By integrating Frauscher's expertise into its Digital Intelligence segment, Wabtec can now offer a more complete suite of solutions to rail operators, from predictive maintenance (via its Evident acquisition) to real-time track monitoring.

The geographic expansion is equally compelling. Frauscher's strong presence in Europe, where it supplies systems to national rail networks, and India, where rail modernization is a government priority, aligns perfectly with Wabtec's push into high-growth markets. CEO Rafael Santana noted the deal's role in “strengthening our portfolio and market opportunities,” a clear signal that Wabtec aims to become the go-to partner for rail operators worldwide.

The Financial Case: Immediate Gains and Sustainable Leverage

The acquisition's terms highlight Wabtec's confidence in the deal's value creation. At an enterprise value of €675 million (roughly $700 million), the purchase price represents 12.4x Frauscher's 2025 EBITDA. That's a reasonable multiple for a company expected to grow faster than Wabtec's average revenue trajectory. Frauscher is projected to generate €145 million in revenue this year, with growth outpacing Wabtec's broader business.

Crucially, Wabtec expects the deal to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year of ownership, a rare feat in an era of pricey acquisitions. The accretion is likely driven by synergies: Wabtec aims to capture €25 million in cost savings over three years through operational integration. With Wabtec's balance sheet still robust—its leverage ratio remains below 2.5x EBITDA—the deal won't strain its financial flexibility.

Investment Thesis: A Play on Digitization and Global Infrastructure Spend

For investors, the acquisition underscores Wabtec's ability to execute on its “strategic M&A” mantra. Over the past five years, Wabtec has completed nine acquisitions, including the $1.78 billion purchase of Evident in early 2025. This track record suggests management knows how to identify undervalued assets and integrate them profitably.

The rail sector is also a beneficiary of secular tailwinds. Governments worldwide are pouring capital into rail modernization—Europe's Green Deal earmarks €2.6 trillion for sustainable transport through 2030, while India's $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan includes major rail upgrades. Frauscher's technologies are directly tied to these projects, positioning Wabtec to win a larger share of this spending.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory approvals could delay closing, though Wabtec's history suggests it navigates such hurdles smoothly. The bigger risk is execution: integrating Frauscher's 600+ employees and ensuring its growth trajectory isn't disrupted. However, Wabtec's track record with past acquisitions—like the 2020 Wilco acquisition, which boosted its aftermarket parts business—gives investors reason to be optimistic.

Verdict: Wabtec's Move Makes It a Buy for the Long Run

Wabtec's stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent quarters, trading at 15x forward EPS—a discount to its 5-year average of 17x. This acquisition could reaccelerate growth and justify a valuation rebound. For investors, WAB is a compelling play on two themes: the digitization of rail infrastructure and the global push for sustainable transportation. With accretion starting in year one and strong long-term growth catalysts, this stock is worth a closer look.",,N,,2025-07-07 11:10:48.685929

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI.

Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, said, ""By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini's global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem, and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention. WNS' complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini's rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.""

WNS's digital-led transformation solutions are used by clients across eight industries. WNS serves a large portfolio of blue-chip clients, such as United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica, and McCain Foods.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of 7-11 per cent for FY26.

This acquisition is expected to position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint.

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients' goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labour-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Both Capgemini and WNS already play in Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The popular fashion store is the latest retailer to give its UK staff body cameras to help stop shoplifting and protect workers from attacks.

The Swedish clothing giant revealed it had been testing the new technology, according to the Mail on Sunday.

The high street brand follows big names like Tesco, the Co-op, and Lidl, all of which have introduced bodycams for their staff.

These major retailers said they were forced to take action because the police had failed to respond.

Shoplifting rose by 20 per cent from last year, with violent and abusive incidents reported around 2,000 times daily.

Criminals - often in organised gangs - have been stealing goods in full view of staff and shoppers, knowing they’re unlikely to face any consequences.

High street retailers urge their staff not to intervene, fearing they could be attacked.

Workers have faced racial and sexual insults, physical threats, spitting, and in some cases, physical violence.

H&M will trial the new bodycams in stores in Edinburgh, Wood Green, and Beckton in London.

A spokesman for the firm said: ""We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers.""

The cameras will be worn on staff uniforms and will record distressing incidents to provide police with video evidence.

Superdrug have also issued police-style bodycams and headsets to staff amid soaring levels of violence by shoplifting thugs.

Abuse and attacks on shop workers rocketed 50 per cent from 870 to 1,300 incidents-a-day last year, according to a leading trade body.

Stores are resorting to desperate measures after the British Retail Consortium blasted “woefully inadequate” government action to tackle theHigh Street “crisis”.

The consortium’s survey also revealed shoplifting has more than doubled to 16.7 million incidents in the past year, up from eight million.

They added: ""The cost of theft has soared to almost £1 billion a year.""

By Aditya Kalra and Arpan Chaturvedi

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian unit of U.S. air conditioning giant Carrier has become the latest major firm to sue Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over electronic waste rules that have hiked the fees manufacturers must pay to recyclers.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Japan's Daikin and Tata's Voltas have also brought suits, which are set to be heard by the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday. All of the companies are seeking to have the rules quashed.

India is the third-biggest generator of electronic waste behind China and the U.S., but the government says only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled.

Modi's government in September fixed a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, which manufacturers argue is roughly three to four times higher than what they paid earlier.

In a 380-page court filing dated June 3, which has not been disclosed publicly, Carrier said recyclers were willing to continue their work at the older prices and the government should not interfere in private dealings between companies and recyclers.

""The burden of the benefit being given to the recyclers has been put on the producers, which is unfair and arbitrary,"" said submissions by Carrier Airconditioning & Refrigeration which were reviewed by Reuters.

The submissions added that the rules will impose a ""huge financial burden"" on the company.

Carrier did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

India's Ministry of Environment also did not respond to Reuters queries. It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.

The new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics. Such rates are still lower than levels in the U.S where they are up to five times higher, according to research firm Redseer.

Carrier reported sales of $248 million in India last year, its highest level since at least the financial year ending March 2020. Its filing said it installed India's first-ever air conditioning system in Jaipur city in 1936.

Forty-four percent of the small businesses Umpqua queried expect the economy to improve in the next 12 months.","Small businesses are demonstrating resilience in the face of continuing macroeconomic uncertainty, as more entrepreneurs are starting businesses and expressing confidence in the economy, both bankers and survey findings indicate.

According to a recent survey by Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp

NYSEUSBU.S. BancorpU.S. Bancorp$47.93USD47.93USD0.44(0.93%)47.52-48.0557.0m

, increasing numbers of small-business owners rate their firms as successful and reported growth in the past year. Their responses dovetail with data gathered by the $676 billion-asset company's network of small-business bankers.

Though entrepreneurs are concerned about access to capital and the impact of tariffs, ""we continue to see very positive and optimistic outcomes from small-business owners in terms of how their businesses are growing and how they're investing in the day-to-day,"" Shruti Patel, U.S. Bank's chief product officer for business banking, told American Banker.

With more than 36 million small businesses operating around the country, according to the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, the sector is huge. Its well-being has a direct impact on banks' health — especially that of community banks, which do the lion's share of lending to small businesses.

Small businesses have faced so many challenges over the past five years — a pandemic, inflation, labor and supply chain disruptions — that they've developed ""a certain amount of numbness"" to macro factors, according to Richard Cabrera, head of corporate and small-business banking at the $52 billion-asset Umpqua Bank, a subsidiary of Tacoma, Washington-based Columbia Banking System. That has enabled them to concentrate on positioning their companies for growth.

""They can focus on their business. They can focus on investment,"" Cabrera told American Banker. ""They realize the elements that they have within their control and grasp, and that gives them a more positive outlook.""

U.S. Bancorp saw Small Business Administration lending activity spike during the agency's 2024 fiscal year. The trend carried over into fiscal 2025, which began on Oct. 1, 2024. Applications for SBA 7(a) loans, which totaled 2,674 through Wednesday, are well on their way to surpassing the 3,119 U.S. Bancorp received throughout fiscal 2024. The bank's numbers reflect the program-wide growth that SBA's flagship loan guarantee program is experiencing.

""We've seen really strong, robust activity around the SBA 7(a) program,"" Patel said. ""We're actually not seeing any softness, despite the macroeconomic stressors.""

Startup activity, too, ""is still very strong,"" Patel said. Indeed, Census Bureau statistics show that so-called ""high propensity"" applications for a license to operate a small business are trending up in 2025. Licensing applications are categorized as ""high propensity"" if they are deemed likely to result in the formation of a business with a payroll.

""What I will say is that [the total of U.S. small businesses] is growing faster than the pre-COVID level,"" Patel said. ""Small-business entrepreneurship is still very top-of-mind.""

About 70% of the small businesses that U.S. Bancorp contacted in its Small Business Perspective report said now is a good time to start a small business.

Umpqua released its annual Small Business Barometer in June. Similar to U.S. Bancorp's findings, Umpqua showed small businesses' outlook improving despite significant concern surrounding inflation, a possible recession and tariffs. Forty-four percent of the small businesses Umpqua queried expect the economy to improve in the next 12 months. That's a four-year high.

""I think it was a little bit of a surprise,"" Cabrera said, referring to the uptick in optimism.

About half of the small and middle-market businesses that participated in Umpqua's survey expect revenue as well as demand for products and services to increase. Meanwhile, 50% of the small businesses surveyed reported that they anticipate investing to adopt or expand their use of generative artificial intelligence tools over the next 12 months.

Those numbers point to stability more than ""frothy growth,"" according to Cabrera. The Business Barometer ""is really a gauge of sentiment,"" he said. ""It's an emotional feel that business owners have that somehow affects their behavior. … That means we think things are okay, steady, and steady's not bad.""

The U.S. Bancorp and Umpqua surveys were made public around the same time that the National Federation of Independent Business released its Small Business Optimism Index for May, showing a three-point increase to 98.8. The top score is 120. May marked the first time this year the index increased.

""While the economy will continue to stumble along until the major sources of uncertainty are resolved, owners reported more positive expectations on business conditions and sales growth,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a press release.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5803ff6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4896x2570+0+428/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2Fc2%2F3a878e5b407db16b9fd22239383c%2Fadobestock-423139051.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 09:10:05.822402

The announcement of the transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, heralds one of the largest mergers within the IT and Business Process services market for many years. The acquisition is described by the parties as a strategic move aimed at establishing a leader in Intelligent Operations, which will be positioned strongly to address the anticipated growth in enterprise demand for Agentic AI-driven process transformation.

The deal, which will be funded from available cash of c.€1bn supplemented by debt issuance, is expected to be immediately accretive to the purchaser’s top and bottom lines. For the calendar year 2024, Capgemini and WNS generated revenues of €22.1bn and €1.2bn and delivered operating margins of 13.3% and 18.5% respectively.

The impact of the buy on Capgemini’s presence in the BPS market will be far more significant, increasing the company’s annual sales in a segment in which it has been comparatively underweight by more than 170%. The boost to Capgemini UK will be even more dramatic, lifting its non-engineering related annual business process services revenues almost fivefold to over £320m. The merger will also create substantial cross-selling opportunities. WNS has built a large blue chip client base which includes Aviva, Centrica, McCain and United Airlines

Widespread rumours of the potential deal have been circulating for the last three months (see here) and on paper the marriage makes a great deal of sense for both organisations. Our latest Market Trends and Forecasts report (see here), anticipates that the growth in BPS demand will remain subdued for the foreseeable future. Enterprises will increasingly channel their energies and investmnets into fundamentally re-imagining process delivery through the deployment of Agentic AI-assisted solutions capable of tackling complex, industry specific challenges. The bringing together of Capgemini’s formidable IT transformation capabilities and WNS’s substantial horizontal and vertical business process expertise establishes a strong foundation from which to capitalise on this market shift.

Both companies have also been making fast progress in building out their AI propositions. We have identified Capgemini as one of the Leading Pack of service suppliers on The Road to AI and WNS has been quick to turn its attention to the potential of AI/Gen AI, with both a range of use cases rolled out to date and through the development of a number of domain focused solutions (see here). Whether the new whole can be made to be more than the sum of its parts remains to be seen. The success of the merger will not, however, be limited by a lack of interest in what it is aspiring to offer.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian unit of U.S. air conditioning giant Carrier has become the latest major firm to sue Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over electronic waste rules that have hiked the fees manufacturers must pay to recyclers.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Japan's Daikin and Tata's Voltas have also brought suits, which are set to be heard by the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday. All of the companies are seeking to have the rules quashed.

India is the third-biggest generator of electronic waste behind China and the U.S., but the government says only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled.

Modi's government in September fixed a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, which manufacturers argue is roughly three to four times higher than what they paid earlier.

In a 380-page court filing dated June 3, which has not been disclosed publicly, Carrier said recyclers were willing to continue their work at the older prices and the government should not interfere in private dealings between companies and recyclers.

""The burden of the benefit being given to the recyclers has been put on the producers, which is unfair and arbitrary,"" said submissions by Carrier Airconditioning & Refrigeration which were reviewed by Reuters.

The submissions added that the rules will impose a ""huge financial burden"" on the company.

Carrier did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

India's Ministry of Environment also did not respond to Reuters queries. It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.

The new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics. Such rates are still lower than levels in the U.S where they are up to five times higher, according to research firm Redseer.

Carrier reported sales of $248 million in India last year, its highest level since at least the financial year ending March 2020. Its filing said it installed India's first-ever air conditioning system in Jaipur city in 1936.

The transaction, unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close by the end of 2025.

This acquisition marks a strategic leap for Capgemini, which aims to position itself as a global leader in Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations—a fast-evolving frontier in enterprise transformation. By integrating WNS’ strong domain expertise and digital-first business process services (BPS) portfolio with its own AI and consulting capabilities, Capgemini is betting on the next phase of enterprise reinvention.

The $3.3 billion deal—valuing WNS shares at $76.50 apiece, a 28% premium over its 90-day average—signals Capgemini’s aggressive move to capture the rising global demand for intelligent, AI-powered business operations. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive, contributing 4% to Capgemini’s normalised earnings per share in 2026, and 7% post-synergies by 2027.

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat noted that “Agentic AI” is ushering in a paradigm shift in how enterprises operate. “Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI,” he said. “Together, Capgemini and WNS will form a powerhouse uniquely positioned to deliver AI-driven process transformation at scale—combining consulting, platforms, technology, and deep vertical expertise.”

The deal reflects a broader trend: businesses are transitioning from mere automation to intelligent, autonomous operations driven by generative and agentic AI. With enterprise AI investments projected to surge, demand is rising for strategic partners who can integrate data, AI, and digital to deliver end-to-end transformation.

WNS’ portfolio—spanning industries such as travel, insurance, banking, energy, and retail—is a strategic asset in this new reality. With long-term contracts, recurring revenues, and blue-chip clients such as United Airlines, Aviva, and M&T Bank, WNS brings scale and resilience to Capgemini’s offerings.

“This is a pivotal chapter in our journey,” said WNS CEO Keshav R. Murugesh. “We’re entering a phase where operating models must be reimagined with AI at their core. Our domain-centric solutions, combined with Capgemini’s Gen AI prowess and global reach, create a compelling proposition for enterprises worldwide.”

WNS has grown revenues at 9% CAGR over the past three years, reporting $1.27 billion in FY2025 with an operating margin of 18.7%. Its non-linear pricing models and digital-led strategy have made it a standout in the global BPS sector. The combined entity’s Digital BPS revenues in 2024 would have exceeded €1.9 billion, with further revenue synergies projected to be between €100 million and €140 million by 2027.

Capgemini will finance the deal with a €4 billion bridge loan, planning to refinance part of it with internal cash and the rest via debt issuance. Significantly, the acquisition will expand Capgemini’s presence in the US market—WNS’ largest revenue base—while aligning seamlessly with its AI-led growth narrative.

Both companies emphasise their shared values and complementary cultures, projecting a smooth integration. WNS will be integrated into Capgemini’s Global Business Services division, with leadership teams expected to collaborate on creating future-ready solutions across industries.

The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, including clearance from the Royal Court of Jersey. If approved, it will reshape the competitive landscape of digital BPS and intelligent operations, with Capgemini emerging as a formidable AI-powered transformation partner.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-07-07%2Fqg8xqf4p%2Fhandshake-blue-line.webp?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-07-07 07:02:38.874176

The state-of-the-art facility is poised to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output and stands as one of the largest mining investments in West Africa’s recent history.

ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel producer, has officially opened a cutting-edge iron ore concentrator at the Tokadeh mine in northern Liberia, marking a defining moment in the country’s post-war economic transformation.

The inauguration event, held in Nimba County and attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai alongside ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, showcased one of Africa’s largest iron ore beneficiation plants.

This new concentrator – the first of its kind in West Africa – is the centrepiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a US$1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total investment in Liberia to about US$3.5 billion. It is one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war, cementing ArcelorMittal’s role as the nation’s biggest foreign investor.

President Boakai hailed the project as a “turning point” for Liberia’s industrial future, calling it a symbol of the country’s resilience and a vote of confidence in its stability.

The new concentrator is engineered to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade iron ore into a high-grade product, adding substantial value before export.

Using advanced beneficiation technology, the plant upgrades raw hematite ore (~35% iron content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate.

This higher-grade concentrate commands a better price on global markets and is in growing demand for efficient, lower-emission steelmaking processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI).

By processing the ore on African soil, Liberia will ship a higher-value product rather than just raw ore, aligning with broader African goals of industrialisation and value addition.

“The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai said at the ceremony.

This emphasis on local beneficiation echoes the African Union’s vision for mineral-led industrialisation, demonstrating how African countries like Liberia (and by extension Ghana and others) can leverage natural resources to spark homegrown industrial development instead of exporting commodities in their lowest form.

ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi Mittal noted that the concentrator will significantly improve product quality and “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” securing the country’s position as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

ArcelorMittal’s expansion has been just as much about building Liberia’s infrastructure as boosting output. Alongside the concentrator, the company has invested heavily in modernising critical transport and energy facilities.

The 243-kilometre railway linking the Tokadeh mines to the coastal port of Buchanan has been completely overhauled, with hundreds of thousands of new sleepers laid, track geometry improved, and new passing loops added to handle long, heavy trains.

These upgrades mean Liberia’s mining corridor now meets international operational and environmental standards, paving the way for multi-user access and regional integration.

ArcelorMittal has publicly endorsed an open access policy for the railway, working with the Liberian government on a practical operational framework to allow other mining companies to utilise the rail and port under fair agreements.

This sets the stage for Liberia to serve as a regional minerals hub: iron ore deposits from neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone could potentially be transported via Liberia’s infrastructure in the future, strengthening West African economic integration.

“These projects are essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people,” President Boakai noted, underscoring how improved infrastructure will connect Liberia and West Africa more deeply to international trade networks.

The scale of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II expansion has delivered an immediate boon in employment and training opportunities for Liberians.

During the construction of the concentrator and associated infrastructure, over 5,000 jobs were created on-site, the majority filled by Liberian workers.

Now that the plant is operational, it is expected to generate roughly 1,000 permanent new jobs in mining, processing, rail operations, and port logistics.

“This brings great relief to our economy, noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” President Boakai said, highlighting the tangible impact on families and communities.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and, through this expansion, has supported over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs over its two decades in the country.

In addition to job creation, a strong emphasis has been placed on skill development to ensure Liberians are at the helm of the industry.

The company’s Training Academy in Yekepa has been expanded and modernised, offering a fully funded multi-year technical training program for youth.

Dozens of young Liberian engineers and technicians are being trained in disciplines such as mechanical maintenance, electrical systems, heavy equipment operations, and ore processing, gaining the expertise needed to operate the sophisticated new concentrator and related facilities.

“I saw young men and women being trained to run this complex facility. They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai remarked, referring to the new cadre of skilled workers emerging from these programmes.

This transfer of knowledge and skills is expected to have a long-term multiplier effect, empowering a new generation of Liberian professionals to lead not only in mining but also to apply their expertise in other sectors.

The expansion has also invigorated local businesses: Liberian contractors were engaged for civil works, trucking, camp services and more, meaning thousands of indirect jobs and a stimulus to local enterprises in Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

As Liberia’s largest taxpayer, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s enlarged operations will contribute increased tax revenues and royalties to the government, enabling greater public investment in development projects across the country.

ArcelorMittal Liberia’s current mining infrastructure has been built with future expansion in mind: the upgraded rail and port can handle up to 30 million tonnes of ore annually, leaving room for a further increase beyond the initial 20 Mt target.

In fact, company officials disclosed ambitions for a phased ramp-up to 30 Mt per year and possibly building a pelletizing plant down the line.

Such expansions would not only boost output but could also enable more in-country processing (like making direct-reduced iron pellets), which would be a game-changer for West Africa’s role in the global steel supply chain.

The project’s social sustainability is also underlined by ArcelorMittal’s community development commitments.

The company contributes about $3 million annually to a community development fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihood programs in local communities.

President Boakai emphasised the importance of this partnership approach, stating that large investments must “enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope” so that communities feel the benefits “not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets”.

He urged ArcelorMittal to continue its support for education, healthcare, and small businesses in Liberia, reinforcing that sustainable development should be a mutually beneficial endeavour for both the investor and the nation.

The successful commissioning of this world-class concentrator in Liberia carries broader implications for Africa’s development trajectory.

It demonstrates that with a stable investment climate and forward-looking policies, African countries can attract and absorb multibillion-dollar investments in heavy industry.

“We would not have invested this scale of capital of nearly $3 billion if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” ArcelorMittal’s Lakshmi Mittal commented, stressing the company’s long-term confidence in the country.

Such an endorsement from a global industry leader sends a positive signal to international markets about West Africa’s potential as an investment destination.

For African governments, the Liberia project highlights the importance of creating a conducive environment for investors while also negotiating agreements that ensure local benefits.

The expansion’s regional integration angle also resonates with continental initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which aims to bolster cross-border infrastructure and industrial supply chains.

By developing a mining and transport corridor that could eventually service multiple countries, Liberia is helping lay the groundwork for West African economic corridors that could link mines, power plants, ports, and cities across borders.

The project’s focus on value addition and skills transfer aligns with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

It offers a case study of other resource-rich nations, such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Ghana, on how investing in local processing facilities and infrastructure can amplify the economic impact of natural resources.

For investors and companies, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s venture underscores the opportunities in Africa’s drive toward industrialisation: building mines and plants not only to extract resources but to refine and export higher-value products and ultimately, finished products.

It also shows that strong ESG practices and community engagement can go hand-in-hand with profitability, thereby de-risking large projects.

In sum, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress, a shining example of resilience, ambition, and partnership. Liberia has emerged from the shadows of conflict and crisis to reclaim its place on the global mining map, this time with a focus on sustainable growth and shared prosperity.

The nation is now poised to export not just raw materials, but innovation, skills, and a narrative of success.

As the first high-grade iron ore shipments from the concentrator set sail later this year, a powerful message reverberates across the continent: Africa is open for business and ready to lead in transforming its natural wealth into lasting development.",https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-10.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 06:02:17.676783

Conclusion In the UK, Barclays is a leader in financial innovation, as it uses digital transformation, strategic alliances, and sustainability efforts to facilitate growth.","In July 2025, Barclays, one of the financial giants in the United Kingdom is turning heads with a radical approach, which the bank is using in enhancing its digital transformation and solidifying its presence in the international banking industry. Barclays is keen on using technology, strategic links, and green campaigns as a growth tool, owing to a market capitalization of about 34 billion pounds and a stable market in retail and investment banking. Based in London, the bank is operating in a difficult economic environment and establishing itself as a leading bank in financial innovations. This 800-word article examines recent developments of Barclays as well as its market performance and the events leading the path of group within the UK and beyond.

Performance and Economic Conditions in the Market

Financial Performance Stock and Health

On July 7, 2025, Barclays shares are selling near 2.20p a share, which is a YTD improvement of nearly 8 percent amid a wider FTSE 100 decline caused by China’s all-time lows in trade statistics. The strength of the bank is premised on the fact that it has diverse revenue lines and its investment banking and the consumer banking arms are strong. In Q1 2025, Barclays recorded a pre-tax profit of 2.2 billion and this was because of the existence of good lending as well as more people in need of digital banking services. Analysts are also positive with targets available at the level of £2.50 at the close of 2025 due to the strategic initiatives of the bank and the UK’s positive economic environment.

Investor Sentiment and Market Position

Barclays has shown how it does it by being proactive in resolving macroeconomic issues affecting it such as inflation along with possible changes in interest rates to boost confidence amongst its investors. Cost consciousness and operational efficiency in the bank has enabled it to keep gaining competitive advantages according to the pressure on smaller banks in the UK. X postings indicate how Barclays is increasingly being recognized as a compliance risk leader, retail investors describe its digital banking solutions, and institutional investors cite its high balance sheet. Nevertheless, what still exists as a possible threat are the global economic uncertainties that are especially seen in the markets dominated by trade.

Fintech Innovation and Digital Transformation

NextGen Banking Platforms

The current president of Barclays, Jes Staley, is betting hard on innovative transformation across several aspects, including a hefty investment in its mobile application and artificial intelligence-powered financial services. The Barclays app, which was launched not long ago, has the new features of personal financial planning, real-time analytics of expenses, and the ability to interact with third-party payment systems. This upgrade has led to a 15 percent increase in active mobile banking users every year, with more than 10 million customers currently using the application. User experience has made the bank a leader in the competitive UK retail banking industry, competing with disrupting fintech companies such as Revolut and Monzo.

Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Community Initiatives

Barclays is a leading bank that has identified the rising impact of cryptocurrencies and decided to accommodate blockchain technology in its business operations. Early in July 2025, the bank partnered with one of the foremost blockchain corporations, saying that it would test a cloud custody service on digital assets for institutional customers. This recent step corresponds to the gradual entry of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, with, as particular examples, the popularity of crypto-themed ETFs in the UK and U.S. markets. Though Barclays has not yet had any direct cryptocurrency trading with retail customers, the fact that the bank is investigating tokenization and stablecoin capabilities points to an innovative thought leadership in the changing financial landscape.

Partnerships Strategy and Sustainability

Partnership with Fintech Dominators

Strategic alliances are one of the growth strategies of Barclays. The bank has further consolidated its partnership with world leaders in technology to improve its cloud-based system to improve the speed of transaction processing and security. Moreover, the Eagle Labs program developed by Barclays supports UK fintech startups by offering funding and taking part in the mentoring of at least 200 early-stage firms in 2025. The partnerships do not only create innovative solutions but they make Barclays a center of the growing scope of London fintech and allow it to attract talent and capital to the city.

ESG Goals Commitment

Barclays is also underway in the green, social, and governance (ESG) efforts, which go in line with the UK’s drive towards sustainable finance. In 2019, the bank committed to spending 100 billion pounds on green financing by 2030, with a target of renewable energy projects and sustainable infrastructure. Another approach that has found favor with environmentally-minded consumers is seen in July 2025, when Barclays launched a mortgage product, the green mortgage, where only energy-efficient properties are placed on preferential terms, which found a fair response amongst the customers. In conjunction with the bank striving to attain net-zero carbon in all its activities by the year 2035, this initiative creates the notion that the bank is a socially responsible institution.

Problems and Threats

Nevertheless, Barclays has threats that might affect its growth despite its good performance. Regular urbanite watchdog in the UK, especially the anti-money laundering and data protection, is a bother. Investment banking: The investment banking division of the bank is also prone to fluctuations in the global market and this may hinder their profitability where the geopolitical restrictions or trade disturbances aggravate. Moreover, there is already competition among digital-only banks and fintech startups that are taking over the market share of retail banking as offered by Barclays. These risks however are averted by the strong capital reserves and the focus on technology as a strategy by the bank.

Analyst Forecasts and Prospects

Barclays has bullish analyst sentiment with a consensus forecast indicating the share price will range between 2.40 pounds ($ 0.80) and 2.60 pounds ($ 0.84) by Q4 2025. The bank is well positioned to grow as it is already in the process of digitalizing itself, and it has good fundamentals, as well as ESG commitments. X postings indicate that rate reductions, which are expected to be made by the Bank of England, would be beneficial to Barclays since it would encourage lending and boost consumer consumption. The bullish RSI level and backing of an upper support area of 2.00 in the technical picture also make the argument for achieving a closer-term breakout.

Conclusion

In the UK, Barclays is a leader in financial innovation, as it uses digital transformation, strategic alliances, and sustainability efforts to facilitate growth. The fact that it invests in fintech, blockchain, and green finance demonstrates its flexibility in an industry that is changing fast. Since these same challenges as those experienced by Barclays like regulatory uncertainties and business fluctuations seem to be in existence, the diversified business model together with the vision to look ahead still places it as a leader in the financial market of UK. The bank is well placed to become the pioneer in bringing the new era of banking, as the institution keeps on innovating and expanding.",https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Leonardo_Lightning_XL_This_dynamic_digital_artwork_showcases_B_0-min.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:09:20.452403

She stressed the need for coordinated efforts among the BCEAO, national governments, and private sector players to build regional resilience against growing digital threats.
Ghislaine Samaké: It would be an overstatement to say that all infrastructures are fully equipped to handle the threats, but progress is undeniable.
Several banks, especially regional groups like Ecobank, have invested heavily in securing their core banking systems, data redundancy, and data center certification.
Essentially, cybersecurity isn't just an add-on; it's fully embedded in our core digital strategy.","Sixty-five percent of banks in sub-Saharan Africa view cyber risks as a major hurdle to digitalization, according to the European Investment Bank. In response, several financial institutions across the region are bolstering their digital defenses. Ghislaine Samaké, Managing Director of Ecobank Guinea-Bissau, offered insight into her group’s cybersecurity strategy during the 2025 Cyber Africa Forum in Cotonou. She stressed the need for coordinated efforts among the BCEAO, national governments, and private sector players to build regional resilience against growing digital threats.

Ecofin Agency: With digital stability becoming a regional priority for West Africa's banking sector, do you believe the current infrastructure is equipped to handle growing cyber threats, and how would you assess its resilience?

Ghislaine Samaké: It would be an overstatement to say that all infrastructures are fully equipped to handle the threats, but progress is undeniable. Several banks, especially regional groups like Ecobank, have invested heavily in securing their core banking systems, data redundancy, and data center certification. However, resilience isn't solely dependent on technical equipment. It also hinges on regional coordination and the ability to respond quickly in the event of an incident.

And on that front, there's still plenty of room for improvement. Things like collaborative penetration testing, sub-regional alert centers, and joint audits should become more systematic.

EA: Given the accelerating digitalization of financial services, including at Ecobank, what categories of cyber risks are now at play, and what approaches has your institution adopted to mitigate them?

GS: Digitalization significantly increases potential entry points for attacks, covering mobile, APIs, cloud services, and agent networks. Each channel exposes our ecosystem to specific threats, ranging from phishing and transactional fraud to DDoS attacks and API injections.

At Ecobank, our strategy follows a multilayered approach. This includes end-to-end encryption, real-time behavioral monitoring, two-factor authentication, robust internal privilege management, and regular stress tests. Essentially, cybersecurity isn't just an add-on; it's fully embedded in our core digital strategy.

EA: Since human error often remains a weak link in cybersecurity, what training, awareness programs, or tools do you offer clients to help secure their online banking activities?

GS: We are fully aware that the human factor remains the main vulnerability. That's why we have developed multiple levels of awareness initiatives. For our employees, we conduct regular training sessions on best practices, phishing, and social engineering, which include internal simulation tests. As for clients, our prevention strategy involves alert campaigns, in-app warning messages, and educational micro-content shared across social media and in our local branches. The ultimate goal is to democratize cyber awareness, making it accessible even for first-time users.

EA: How is Ecobank integrating AI or biometric innovations into its cybersecurity systems?

GS: Ecobank is actively exploring innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics to bolster its cybersecurity. Across several of our group entities, AI is already at work, improving transaction anomaly detection and refining risk scoring. Biometrics are also integrated into our authentication processes, particularly through mobile apps, utilizing fingerprint and facial recognition, along with one-time passwords (OTPs). This approach allows us to strengthen access security without complicating the user experience. Our ongoing challenge is to ensure top-tier safety while maintaining inclusivity for all users.

EA: What role do you see the BCEAO and West African governments playing in supporting banks against cyber risks?

GS: The BCEAO has played a structuring role by establishing an initial, coherent framework for financial innovation and cybersecurity. This includes licensing fintechs, regulating digital services, and promoting stronger IT supervision, all of which deserve recognition.

The next challenge is to deepen sub-regional harmonization through shared incident response protocols, interconnected alert platforms, and joint best-practice guidelines between banks and regulators. On the government side, strengthening cyber legislation, improving judicial coordination, and implementing cyber training programs for critical operators are essential.

Ultimately, cybersecurity is as much a public policy issue as a banking concern. It's a collective undertaking, engaging financial institutions, regulators, and public authorities alike.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/86c80ba7d4ca4b8e0f7e1507a2a2918e_S.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 04:59:56.354029

With consumers increasingly craving authenticity and relatability, Lucky gives Luckin a way to connect that feels local, even when scaling globally.
Chinese brands are entering global markets with increasingly sophisticated, culturally rich strategies.","As Starbucks navigates declining sales and store closures in its home market, an unexpected challenger started making its move into North America. Luckin Coffee, once best known for its rapid rise (and scandalous fall) in China, is now expanding abroad, with its first locations outside of Asia recently opening in New York. But unlike Starbucks, Luckin isn’t selling a lifestyle rooted in Seattle coffeehouse culture. Instead, it’s exporting the game plan that it honed and refined in the China market.

And it’s not alone. From the runaway success of collectibles like Labubu to the global influence of brands like Mixue, HeyTea, and even White Rabbit, China is no longer just a manufacturing base for global culture … it’s becoming a source of it. China’s expanding brands are showing a shift in cultural influence, driven by storytelling, aesthetics, and emotional resonance that may work just as well in Los Angeles or London as they do in Chengdu.

The Art of the Collab

Luckin has earned a reputation in China as the undisputed king of brand collaborations. From shock-value crossovers with Moutai liquor to delicate tie-ins with hit dramas like Chang’an’s Lychee, Luckin has built a playbook based on timely, culturally relevant partnerships.

Each collab isn’t just about riding a trend, but a much broader strategy:

Reach new audiences across interest tribes

Build emotional resonance via storytelling

Turn limited-time products into viral phenomena

The results speak for themselves: the company’s monthly active customers reached 71.8 million in 2024, up 48.5% from 2023. As much as the drinks have driven traffic, so too have the cultural cachet and merch: collectible badges, character stickers, “mystery blind boxes,” and now, the wildly popular bag charms (including the viral “Lucky Pony” in the Lychee collab).

But like many Chinese consumer brands, Luckin knew that relying solely on borrowed equity had limits. Which is why it’s taken the next step: creating its own IP.

Meet “Lucky”: A Mascot with Meaning

In early 2024, Luckin formally introduced “Lucky,” a reimagined version of its blue deer logo, elevated from a back-end chatbot to a full-blown brand ambassador, complete with costumes, keychains, and its own social media presence.

Lucky is more than a cartoon. It reflects a localised evolution of the mascot trend seen in Asia, where characters like Mixue’s Snow King or Bilibili’s “22 & 33” aren’t just cute figures, but vehicles for brand storytelling, emotional engagement, and even product endorsements.

What sets Lucky apart is its personality: not polished and aspirational like Starbucks’ tone, rather it’s clumsy, loveable, and a bit chaotic. It shows up in employee uniforms, gets in the way during store shoots, and refers to itself tongue-in-cheek as a “Chief Luck Officer.” It’s disarming, funny, and - crucially - memorable.

With consumers increasingly craving authenticity and relatability, Lucky gives Luckin a way to connect that feels local, even when scaling globally.

When the Small Touches Say It All

Luckin doesn’t just do big gestures. In fact, one of its strengths is the care it gives to tiny details.

A recent campaign for Chang’an’s Lychee saw not just product tie-ins and merch, but also a poetic, beautifully written cup sleeve, evoking Tang Dynasty history, imperial couriers, and the fleeting sweetness of fresh lychee. The result? Viral praise, reposts, and even customers ordering the drink just to collect the sleeve.

This attention to micro-storytelling through copy, packaging, and design, turns every order into a shareable experience. It evokes as much as it informs. As ads are becoming less effective and less trusted, word-of-mouth endorsements matter more than ever.

Brewing Something Bigger

As Luckin plants its flag in North America, don’t expect a cookie-cut rollout of what works in China. Nevertheless, we may see some similarities such as:

A digitally-centric approach to the customer journey and heavy use of data in decision-making

Collectible Lucky mascots tailored to local pop culture

Seasonal collabs with regional artists or streaming hits

Beautifully designed cups, sleeves, and snacks that invite storytelling, not just consumption

More importantly, expect a Chinese brand using its playbook from home to win hearts abroad. That matters not just for competitors in the coffee space, but for global marketers everywhere.

Why it Matters

For years, the standard playbook for foreign brands entering China was simple: localise, partner, adapt. But now, we’re seeing the reverse. Chinese brands are entering global markets with increasingly sophisticated, culturally rich strategies.

In many ways, Chinese brands are hungrier and appreciate that they need to work harder than foreign brands did when they entered on the back foot, because they are coming from a less-aspirational base. That makes them even more worth watching out for.

To compete in this new global consumer landscape, brands in the West will need to understand how China’s best brands think, tell stories, and build connections. There’s a good chance they will be your hungriest, and potentially best-resourced competitors.

And if a blue deer in a barista apron starts trending in your local mall or high street, now you’ll know why.

This move, which grants Crédit Agricole full control of its asset servicing subsidiary, underscores a broader shift toward vertical integration and market leadership in a sector grappling with digitization, regulatory complexity, and margin pressures. Below, we dissect the deal's implications for sector consolidation, Crédit Agricole's retail banking competitiveness, and valuation opportunities in French/Spanish financials.

Strategic Implications: Consolidation as a Growth Engine

The acquisition positions Crédit Agricole to capitalize on a consolidating European asset servicing market, projected to grow at 5-7% annually through 2030. CACEIS's assets under custody surged to €5.47 trillion by Q1 2025, a 9% year-on-year increase, fueled by mandates from institutional clients like Syz Asset Management and Vesper Infrastructure Fund. By acquiring full ownership, Crédit Agricole eliminates governance friction and accelerates integration with its institutional banking divisions, such as wealth management and corporate services.

The strategic rationale is clear: vertical control over CACEIS's AI-driven platforms (e.g., Nephelai) and digital asset servicing capabilities (including its Luxembourg-based hub with MiCA authorization) allows the bank to scale innovation faster. This aligns with sector trends: 64% of financial institutions now partner with fintechs, while 52% prioritize digital experience upgrades. Crédit Agricole's move is a preemptive strike to dominate fee-based revenue streams in an era where cross-border institutional services and ESG mandates are surging.

While the deal temporarily reduced Crédit Agricole's fully-loaded CET1 ratio by 30 basis points to 12.1%, its phased-in CET1 ratio under CRR3 regulations remains robust at 17.6%. This regulatory tailwind, coupled with Q1 2025 net income of €1.82 billion, mitigates near-term capital concerns.

Retail Banking: Cross-Selling Synergies and Customer Growth

The acquisition's impact on retail banking is subtler but strategically significant. Crédit Agricole's French retail division added 433,000 new customers in Q1 2025, while international retail (Italy/Poland) grew by 117,000. Deposit growth in France and Italy rose 1.3% year-on-year, supported by cross-selling opportunities with CACEIS. For instance:

- AI-Driven Solutions: CACEIS's technology stack, now fully integrated, can enhance digital banking tools for retail clients (e.g., personalized investment insights).

- Cross-Sector Mandates: CACEIS's role in managing pension funds (e.g., Lincolnshire County Council) creates upsell avenues for Crédit Agricole's corporate and retail clients.

However, risks persist. Retail banking revenues in France grew only 1% in Q1 2025, while international retail declined 3% due to forex headwinds in Egypt. Crédit Agricole must balance institutional growth with retail profitability, especially as peers like BNP Paribas and Société Générale face margin pressures in traditional lending.

Valuation: Undervalued French Financials vs. Spanish Peers

Crédit Agricole trades at 0.8x book value—below its five-year average of 0.95x—despite a 5% dividend yield and 45% payout ratio. This discount contrasts with Spanish banks like Banco de Sabadell, which offers an 8.1% dividend yield but faces higher operational risks (e.g., regional economic exposure). Key valuation takeaways:

Upside Potential: Crédit Agricole's 9.7x P/E multiple (inferred from €15.88 stock price and €2.03 EPS) suggests undervaluation relative to its 15% revenue growth in asset servicing (€2.06 billion in Q1 2025).

Risk-Adjusted Attractiveness: Its beta of 0.73 implies lower volatility than the market. The GF Value of €14.52 versus a current price of €15.88 hints at modest downside protection.

Dividend Dynamics: While the dividend yield has dipped from an 8.5% five-year average, the payout ratio remains sustainable at 45%, offering income stability in a low-yield environment.

Investment Considerations: Buy with a Long-Term Lens

Crédit Agricole's acquisition of CACEIS is a strategic win for its institutional ambitions but carries execution risks. Investors should weigh:

- Bull Case: Full synergies materialize (€70M+ cost savings by 2027), driving EPS accretion and a valuation rerating to 1.0x book value.

- Bear Case: Economic slowdowns reduce institutional client activity, and CET1 pressures persist.

Recommendation:

- Buy: For investors seeking exposure to European asset servicing growth and dividend income. The 5-7% yield, coupled with a 50% discount to peers, offers asymmetric upside.

- Hold: If uncertain about near-term macro risks or regulatory hurdles in digital asset servicing.

Conclusion

Crédit Agricole's full ownership of CACEIS is a masterstroke in a consolidating market. While challenges remain, the deal's focus on technological leadership and cross-divisional synergies positions the bank to outperform peers in fee-based revenue growth. For investors, the stock's undervaluation and resilient dividend yield make it a compelling pick in French/Spanish financials—a sector primed for consolidation-driven winners.",,N,,2025-07-07 05:00:03.902704
