The value of an activated cytotoxic T-cell profile in diagnosing HLH in this group of patients is unknown. Critically ill children with malignancies who suffered from persistent cytopenia in the pediatric intensive care unit were included. Children were divided into two groups based on how many clinical HLH diagnostic criteria they fulfilled: M-HLH group, ≥5 criteria; hematologic malignancy (HM) group, ≤4 criteria. Flow cytometry tests were performed within 24 h after the patient’s admission. Thirty-seven children who fulfilled the requirements were enrolled. Twenty children were classified into the M-HLH group and 17 into the HM group. The M-HLH group exhibited a higher mortality rate than the HM group. CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8+ T cells% and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) were elevated in the M-HLH group. The area under the curve values of the two indexes were 0.906 and 0.897 respectively for the identification of M-HLH in the critically ill children, with CD38+/HLA-DR + CD8+ T cells% &gt; 39.66% and IFN-γ &gt; 22.58 exhibiting the best performance.

2025-03-05 14:11:28+00:00,BW Businessworld,B2B Firms Expect More Than Connectivity As Telecom Challenges Persist,"A significant shift in the expectations of Indian B2B organisations from telecom providers has been revealed in a new report by the Capgemini Research Institute. The study highlighted that businesses are demanding more than just connectivity, prioritising digitalisation, cybersecurity, and innovation. However, several challenges, including service reliability, network performance, and cybersecurity risks, continue to impact satisfaction levels.According to the report, 61 per cent of Indian B2B organisations expect telecom providers to simplify the overall experience through digitalisation, while 54 per cent want the buying and servicing process to be fully automated. Despite these expectations, only a third of businesses are satisfied with network performance and reliability, raising concerns about service quality.&nbsp;While 74 per cent of Indian B2B organisations prioritise network performance, only 57 per cent express satisfaction with the range of services being offered. Additionally, 53 per cent report dissatisfaction with support received during natural disasters and cyberattacks, highlighting a gap in telecom providers’ crisis response capabilities.Security remains a top priority for businesses, with 70 per cent of Indian B2B organisations identifying cybersecurity as a critical need. However, only 57 per cent feel their telecom providers offer robust cybersecurity protections.&nbsp;The report also revealed that 83 per cent of Indian businesses expect data security measures, while 73 per cent look for fraud protection. The lack of comprehensive security services from telecom operators continues to be a major challenge for businesses seeking to protect sensitive data and communications.The study also shed light on the evolving role of telecom providers as innovation partners. While 66 per cent of businesses intend to collaborate more with telecom providers in the next one to two years, half of them expect providers to integrate IT, system support, and industry expertise into their services. Despite these expectations, the availability of innovation-focused services remains limited, with only 56 per cent of Indian B2B organisations having access to pilot projects and prototypes from their telecom providers.Service quality and customer experience remain areas for improvement. The report highlights that 44 per cent of Indian B2B organisations are willing to pay a premium for improved customer experience. However, many businesses still face challenges related to customer support. About 67 per cent expect dedicated account management and responsive support, while 63 per cent look for seamless transitions between customer service channels. Additionally, 66 per cent expect 24/7 live chat support, and 64 per cent prefer proactive communication through email and SMS, suggesting that telecom providers need to enhance their service offerings to meet customer expectations.Another critical challenge is the demand for cloud sovereignty. Sixty-one per cent of Indian B2B organisations cite security as their top concern when adopting cloud-based telecom solutions, while 60 per cent prioritise ownership of data to ensure full control. Transparency, cloud data location, and interoperability remain key areas where businesses expect improved solutions from their telecom providers. Despite this, many telecom companies are yet to offer fully developed cloud solutions that meet these specific requirements.Telecom providers are also being urged to support businesses in adopting new technologies. The report indicates that 60 per cent of Indian B2B organisations plan to invest in enhanced 5G services such as network slicing and ultra-reliable low-latency communications. Additionally, 54 per cent expect telecom providers to offer Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), while 51 per cent look for end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. As businesses move towards digital transformation, the challenge for telecom operators lies in delivering these advanced technologies at scale while ensuring reliability and security.Data analytics and artificial intelligence are also key focus areas, with 73 per cent of Indian B2B organisations planning to invest in data analytics services and 72 per cent looking to buy AI-driven applications. However, access to tailored insights and predictive analytics remains a challenge, as telecom providers are yet to fully integrate these solutions into their offerings. Additionally, 64 per cent of businesses seek managed cloud services, while 59 per cent look for edge and fog computing solutions, indicating a growing need for advanced computing capabilities.",,,,,,https://static.businessworld.in/1495790743_NZgAZM_telecom-shutterstock.jpg,https://www.businessworld.in/article/b2b-firms-expect-more-than-connectivity-as-telecom-challenges-persist-549806,2025-03-05 14:10:56.492202,,
