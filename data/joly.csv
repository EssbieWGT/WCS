ID5,AXA,2025-04-08 23:36:26+00:00,impact.economist.com,Deepfake Fraud: How Organisations Can Protect Against This Emerging Cyber Threat,Not Available,,,,,https://impact.economist.com/projects/deepfake-fraud,"They just have to do something that causes its share price to fall,” explains Ms Chia.
Companies need to plan for deepfake risk mitigation, according to Vanessa Leemans, AXA XL’s head of cyber, UK & Lloyd’s.
“The question is not how fast you run, but how fast you run relative to attackers,” Ms Chia advises.
Ms Chia believes that the perpetrators of many types of fraud will start to use deepfakes.
The emergence of deepfake fraud could herald a period where adversaries run faster than defenders, who must play catch-up.","In early 2024, a Hong Kong-based employee of the UK engineering firm Arup transferred a total of US$25m to five separate bank accounts, before discovering that they had fallen victim to an elaborate fraud. The employee had been duped into making the payments as a result of a conference call in which all other participants, including someone purporting to be the company’s chief financial officer, were deepfakes — their voices and likenesses had been digitally cloned and manipulated with AI by fraudsters.

Although the scam heralded a new frontier in crime, Michelle Chia, chief underwriting officer for cyber, Americas, at AXA XL Insurance, a leading provider of insurance for businesses worldwide and part of the global insurance group AXA, stresses that this was an old crime committed with new technology. “Employees often receive emails purporting to be from their CEOs, requesting they move money into a bank account, which the vast majority have learned to ignore. This fraud was the same type of crime, but rather than email, it was conducted via a video call employing new techniques that capitalise on a lack of vigilance caused by perceived technological limitations. What is worrying is that deepfakes are now more realistic — and harder to detect — and that is only going to get worse,” says Ms Chia.

Deepfakes are not limited to impacting an organisation financially; they can also be used to destroy reputations. For example, deepfakes can be employed to imitate a company’s CEO saying bad things about their products, organisations or competitors. What is worse, reputational attacks can be carried out without breaching a company’s firewall.

“Fake news is a powerful weapon that adversaries can monetise without compromising an organisation’s multi-factor authentication controls. They just have to do something that causes its share price to fall,” explains Ms Chia.

Companies need to plan for deepfake risk mitigation, according to Vanessa Leemans, AXA XL’s head of cyber, UK & Lloyd’s. “Organisations can better prepare themselves before, during and after a deepfake attack, so they are better able to identify deepfakes, understand how to respond to a deepfake attack, and how to recover. But they must create and test these plans now,” she warns.

Employees are a vital part of the identification process. Most organisations have in place training to combat phishing emails. Ms Leemans recommends that this training should also include deepfakes. “If all employees are trained to detect and report deepfakes, an organisation broadens the protective net it can cast.”

The same practices in general cybersecurity also apply to managing deepfake exposure. Zero-trust user validation processes are especially useful to prevent deepfake video calls. Multi-factor authentication to access a video call stops adversaries in their tracks.

Although software is an important tool in the fight against deepfakes, it cannot prevent all deepfake attacks, especially reputational attacks. Ms Leemans explains that a deepfake attack is like any other PR threat. “Organisations must develop a clear, concise message about what has happened, and quickly share the company's position to nip it in the bud.”

While deepfakes are becoming harder to spot, their future impact remains uncertain. As with other cybersecurity risks, attackers and defenders are on a constant treadmill. When defenders improve their detection methods, adversaries improve their deepfakes. “The question is not how fast you run, but how fast you run relative to attackers,” Ms Chia advises. “Sometimes defenders will be winning. Other times, it will be the attackers. One is always chasing the other. It's an arms race.”

It is almost impossible to anticipate what the next fraud trend will be, so the best organisations can do is to proactively manage risk. However, even the best-designed programmes cannot mitigate risk entirely. This is where insurers like AXA XL step in.

Ms Chia believes that the perpetrators of many types of fraud will start to use deepfakes. She cites the example of the recent, eye-catching incident that targeted a luxury food retailer, where fraudsters used fake credentials to steal £300,000 worth of product. This is just the type of fraud that deepfakes could make more convincing. “We offer crime policies to cover this type of loss. The question is whether a firm has taken appropriate precautions to make sure they have identified where they might suffer financial loss, and how they manage that. The insurance industry works hard to keep up with the evolving risks our clients face, and provide the risk transfer our clients need.”

But, as her colleague Ms Leemans is keen to point out, insurers do not just provide a risk transfer service. AXA XL monitors what happens across a broad portfolio and identifies new trends as they occur. As a consequence, they can recommend to their partners on the most appropriate risk mitigation factors and controls to help them to reduce their risk exposure. “In the face of rising risk from deepfakes, cyber insurers play an important role by sharing insights to help organisations improve their risk awareness and protect themselves from these evolving risks,” she explains.

The emergence of deepfake fraud could herald a period where adversaries run faster than defenders, who must play catch-up. That race cannot be won alone — it will be a team effort.",https://images.ctfassets.net/9crgcb5vlu43/1p3NqrFLnXQReIIWu5oUGG/aa886b5477512e05d643db3212329047/Banner_image_article_2_AXA_screen_resolution.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 20:04:59.494067

(Reuters) -CVS Health on Tuesday tapped former UPS executive Brian Newman for the role of finance chief, as new CEO David Joyner strengthens management ranks in his bid to turn around the company.

After taking the helm in October, Joyner laid out cost-cutting plans and named a new insurance head to help the company navigate one of the most challenging periods in its six-decade history.

CVS, which has faced financial struggles and investor pressure in the past few years, missed its earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024.

""A major piece of the CVS stock recovery story revolves around restoring management credibility,"" said James Harlow, senior vice president at CVS investor Novare Capital Management. He said bringing in an outsider with major company experience as CFO was a positive step in that direction.

CVS Health shares rose over 8% and were also boosted by bigger-than-expected increase in the U.S. government's reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans in 2026 that lifted shares across the sector.

Newman, who played a major role in guiding United Parcel Service through the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped down as CFO last year to focus on his health. The 56-year-old executive spent about three decades with PepsiCo in numerous finance leadership roles before joining UPS in 2019.

He replaces Thomas Cowhey as CFO and will receive a base salary of $1 million. Cowhey will become a strategic adviser to Joyner, effective May 12, after little over a year as CFO.

CVS expects its 2025 financial results ""will meet or exceed"" its previously issued forecast. Harlow said this indicated that ""the management has a better handle"" on the business.

CVS had said in February that it expects to earn an annual adjusted profit of between $5.75 and $6.00 per share. Analysts expect an annual per share profit of $5.91, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Embracing the rise of social commerce, Best Buy has begun inviting influencers to join its “new curated shopping experience,” a program in which creators earn commissions from tech products they sell to Best Buy customers via digital storefronts.

Customers can find creators’ personal “Storefronts” on creators.bestbuy.com, where creators are able to present collections of their favorite Best Buy products to customers, with links to their social media accounts.

According to the retailer, this “one-stop shop” highlights tech items already featured in their social media content and allows creators to earn a commission on sales referred through the storefront. There is no commission cap.

The program -- powered by marketing platform Impact.com -- has launched with three popular tech influencers, including Linus Sebastian (of Linus Tech Tips), who has over 16 million YouTube subscribers and 8 billion total video views, as well as tech reviewer Judner Aura (UrAvgConsumer), and Jenna Ezarik, a tech and lifestyle creator.

Through creator recommendations, Best Buy hopes storefronts collections will help customers seek out products with more confidence and ease. For example, if a customer is looking for products related to their wellness routines, a health and fitness influencer's storefront will suggest specific products they’ve already featured in their videos.

The creator program is another way to persuade influencers to showcase more Best Buy products across social media platforms, as the company competes with retailers like Amazon and Walmart, who have also launched influencer programs.

CVS Pharmacy District Leader Ashley Ellis, a pharmacist and Greenbrier resident, testified she would lose her job if the bill passes, as would hundreds of her colleagues.","The Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee advanced a bill Tuesday (April 8) that would prevent pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like CVS Health from operating retail pharmacies in Arkansas.

The committee passed House Bill 1150 by Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon, and Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, by a voice vote. Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, voted no.

The bill passed the House on April 3 by a count of 89-4, with three not voting and four voting present. The bill now heads to the full Senate.

Pharmacy benefit managers manage prescription drug benefits for health insurers and other payers. By processing drug claims, they effectively set the rates at which pharmacies are reimbursed for their services, as well as provide the reimbursements.

The four largest PBMs control 70% of the market, according to the American Medical Association. CVS Health controls 21.3%, OptumRx controls 20.8%, Express Scripts controls 17.1%, and Prime Therapeutics controls 10.3%.

They also are “vertically integrated” in that they operate their own retail establishments that compete against the independent pharmacies they reimburse. CVS operates 23 pharmacies in Arkansas.

THE DEBATE FOR AND AGAINST

Hammer told the committee that PBMs are steering patients to their out-of-state pharmacies while inflating prices. He said the bill “simply says you can’t be a PBM that both sets the price for themselves and their competition.”

John Vinson, Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO, said Arkansas has had a net loss of 65 pharmacies in Arkansas as a result of PBMs’ anti-competitive practices. A pharmacy in Pine Bluff closed last week.

Greg Reybold with the American Pharmacy Cooperative, which represents more than 80 Arkansas independent pharmacies, said a Mississippi audit found one PBM had paid its pharmacies more than competitors in 75,000 claims.

“I would go so far as to say that today, Arkansas is the center of the pharmacy universe, because you guys are on the verge of pushing forward a solution that will be comprehensive, and it will be complete,” he said.

Irvin expressed frustration that the Legislature has tried in the past to address the issue, saying the state cannot fix what the policymakers at the federal level will not fix. She said the government is picking winners and losers and shutting out competition.

Randy Zook, president and CEO of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, testified in opposition to the bill, saying lawmakers have passed legislation to regulate PBMs, and if there is a problem, the law needs to be enforced. He said vertical integration is common and often used by large organizations, and the bill’s purpose was to remove competition from the marketplace.

He said consumers may like the convenience of mail order pharmacies or of shopping at a particular location.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, expressed surprise that the chamber would side with the “oligarchs,” arguing the Arkansas Constitution says monopolies “are contrary to the genius of a republic.” Sen. Reginald Murdock, D-Marianna, said pharmacy patients are not as free to choose another provider as they are to choose a fast food restaurant.

CVS Pharmacy District Leader Ashley Ellis, a pharmacist and Greenbrier resident, testified she would lose her job if the bill passes, as would hundreds of her colleagues. She said passing the bill would reduce options for patients.

“We are not just professionals behind the counter,” she said. “We are your neighbors, friends and family members. We are deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve, providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year.”

In his closing remarks, Hammer expressed sympathy for those who might lose their job. However, he said he also has sympathy for those who have already lost their job.

His district had a CVS that closed suddenly and another large local pharmacy that closed because of cash flow issues. Local pharmacies along with Walgreens, Walmart and Harps Foods Stores picked up the slack. Furthermore, local pharmacies invest in their communities, he said.

Senators could consider HB 1150 as early as Wednesday in the full Senate. If approved, it would go to Gov. Sarah Sanders for signature or veto.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pillbottle-medicine.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 18:07:57.468537

“Despite market shifts, mobile gaming in APAC remains on a strong growth trajectory,” said April Tayson, Regional Vice President for INSEAU at Adjust.
In APAC, the Philippines and Indonesia led in gaming app install and session growth.
The Philippines saw a 4% increase in installs and 9% in sessions, while Indonesia recorded 21% growth in installs and 6% in sessions.

Mobile game installs in the region rose 4% YoY in 2024, despite a 3% dip in sessions, signaling opportunities for marketers to refine retention strategies and maximize long-term player engagement.

“Despite market shifts, mobile gaming in APAC remains on a strong growth trajectory,” said April Tayson, Regional Vice President for INSEAU at Adjust. “As mobile-first adoption accelerates, it’s developers and marketers focusing on long-term player engagement — rather than short-term gains — who will be best positioned to thrive. Leveraging the power of AI-driven personalization and hybrid monetization, to name a few, will be key in building sustainable success in this dynamic industry.”

Globally, the report highlights a mixed outlook. While LATAM (+8% installs, +7% sessions) and MENA (+10% installs, +5% sessions) saw strong momentum, North America (-11% installs, -14% sessions) and Europe (-1% installs, -6% sessions) faced engagement challenges, underscoring the need for strategic adaptation.

Gaming sessions and installs increase globally, with the Philippines and Indonesia at the forefront of APAC

Adjust data shows that in 2024, hyper casual games led global installs (27%) but accounted for only 11% of sessions, highlighting high churn. In contrast, action games, with just 10% of installs, drove 21% of sessions and the longest average playtime (45.15 mins), indicating strong retention. Strategy apps saw the highest YoY install growth (+83%), while casino (+32%) and arcade (+23%) apps led in session growth, reflecting high engagement.

In APAC, the Philippines and Indonesia led in gaming app install and session growth. The Philippines saw a 4% increase in installs and 9% in sessions, while Indonesia recorded 21% growth in installs and 6% in sessions. Meanwhile, other markets showed mixed results: India saw a 2% rise in installs but a 1% drop in sessions, while Vietnam experienced a slight 0.3% uptick in installs but a sharp 18% decline in sessions.

In terms of regional session lengths, APAC had a slight increase with users logging in 34.84 minutes per session in 2024 compared to 34.32 minutes in 2023, and longer than the global average of 30.75 minutes per session. Indonesia recorded the longest gaming sessions in 2024, at an average of 44.31 minutes, with the Philippines (43.4) and Singapore (39.14) following closely. Thailand and South Korea remained strong – both exceeding 35 minutes.

ATT opt-in rates are seeing incremental growth globally, especially APAC

Gaming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) opt-in rates increased slightly in Q1 of 2025 to 40% from 38% in the same quarter of 2024. Big contributors to this growth are attributed to India (from 43% to 44.2%), Indonesia (from 54.2% to 58.6%), Malaysia (from 46.9% to 51.9%), Philippines (from 41.6% to 47.4%), Singapore (from 26% to 29%) and Thailand (from 49.7% to 51.4%)

Globally, arcade games saw the most significant growth, with opt-ins jumping from 42.4% to 59.3%. Sports (54.1%), casino (38.3%), and action (45.9%) games also saw gains, while hyper casuals experienced a slight drop.

Key overall shifts Adjust observed in the mobile gaming industry globally in 2025 include:

AI-driven personalization enhancing player engagement: AI is revolutionizing in-game experiences and predictive retention strategies.

Hybrid monetization is on the rise: Developers are increasingly blending in-app purchases (IAP), ads, subscriptions, and battle passes to diversify revenue streams.

Cross-platform play expands: Seamless transitions between mobile, PC, and console are increasing retention and lifetime value (LTV).

New UA frontiers emerge: Connected TV (CTV), influencer marketing, and alternative app stores are reshaping game discovery.

“With APAC’s sustained momentum, marketers need to stay agile in adapting to evolving player behaviors,” April added. “Success will depend on embracing diverse monetization models, optimizing user acquisition across new channels, and continuously refining engagement strategies to keep players invested in the long run”.",https://www.adobomagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Adjust-Report-APAC-powers-hero.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 17:06:36.007866

Its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October.
For its Q1 results, total same-store sales was down 4% year over year.
International same-store sales fell 4%, and China sales dropped 6%.","As companies scramble to respond to Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs, anti-American sentiment towards US brands is emerging as another concern.

A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on April 5, while higher reciprocal tariffs are set to begin on April 9.

For food chains, the headwind from tariffs on commodity imports is relatively small, as many ingredients are domestically grown and most imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). But brands like McDonald's (MCD), Yum! Brands (YUM), Starbucks (SBUX), and Domino's (DPZ) have exposure to international markets that could hurt them as customers pull back, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said.

""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands ... we'll see ... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks, if they're starting to see that already,"" Saleh told Yahoo Finance.

Goldman Sachs estimates that foreign boycotts overall will cut US GDP by 0.1% to 0.3% this year, meaning a hit of roughly $28 billion to $83 billion.

Major fast food players were only beginning to turn the tide in their international business after the pandemic. China's ""zero-COVID policy"" lasted for three years, far longer than US policies. The stringent, prolonged shutdown had major implications for international sales.

Last quarter, McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4%, compared to the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected. Its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October.

McDonald's international-owned stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, which CFO Ian Borden attributed to the lapse of the impact of the Israeli conflict, plus growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.

Starbucks is still struggling to see a rebound in its international business. For its Q1 results, total same-store sales was down 4% year over year. International same-store sales fell 4%, and China sales dropped 6%.

Starbucks is facing a stagnant domestic economy and fierce local competition in China. CEO Brian Niccol said he visited and saw firsthand ""how dynamic the market is and the opportunities ahead.""

Prior to Niccol joining, the team said it was in the ""very early stages"" of exploring joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate, and supply chain in the country.

For Yum China (YUMC), which separated from the US operation back in 2016, fourth quarter same-store sales fell 1% for KFC and 2% for Pizza Hut. CEO Joey Wat called it a ""challenging environment"" with ""value-minded consumers.""

Domino's global retail sales grew 4.4% in its latest quarter. CFO Sandeep Reddy told investors, ""As we look ahead to 2025, we continue to believe that global retail sales growth should be generally in line with 2024.""

International growth is a key component for fast food players, which have seen flagging foot traffic and appetite in the US as competition from fast casual players like Chipotle (CMG) ramp up.

McDonald's put forth aggressive growth plans at the end of 2023, including expanding to 50,000 global restaurants by 2027, the fastest pace of growth in its 68-year history. That same year, it agreed to buy back Carlyle's minority ownership stake in its China business for a reported $1.8 billion.

By 2025, Starbucks said it wanted to have 9,000 stores in China. As of the last quarter, the US and China make up 61% of the company's portfolio, with 17,049 and 7,685 stores in the two countries, respectively.

Chipotle (CMG) is also expanding its footprint. In 2023, it announced a development agreement to open restaurants in the Middle East and accelerate its international expansion efforts.

Yum! Brands' Taco Bell called international its ""next growth engine"" at its investor day last month, with plans to increase international store count to more than 3,000 by 2030, from 1,153 in 2024.

But there could be a major speed bump ahead.

""If the governments in those countries start to view US brands more negatively, they can slow-roll their approval process. They can deny them in certain areas, make it much more difficult for US brands to grow,"" Saleh said.

He added that it's ""hard to assess"" when it'll be the case.

""There could be some ... call it guilt by association,"" Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace told Yahoo Finance. ""The appetite for certain US brands could be diminished as a result of what we're seeing play out on the global economic and trade front.""

He added, ""Take a look at what we're seeing with Elon Musk and Tesla, where people are ... openly protesting, people returning their Teslas."" He posed the question, ""Could we see something similar unfold with other well-known US brands in foreign markets?""

In its annual report regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger reported that it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs,” which included “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs).” The failed merger, which was originally announced in October 2022, cost Kroger $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report.
In late March, meanwhile, Kroger filed a legal response to Albertsons’ earlier lawsuit against it, which claimed that Kroger failed to exercise “best efforts” and to take “any and all actions” to obtain regulatory approval of the companies’ proposed merger deal.
Kroger is now claiming that while it was working to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret campaign alongside C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts.
Kroger says that as a result of its misconduct, Albertsons is not entitled to the $600 million termination fee under the terms of the parties' merger agreement, nor is Albertsons entitled to other damages it is seeking.","It has come to light that The Kroger Co. spent more than $1 billion throughout its ill-fated journey toward merging with Albertsons Cos.

The failed merger, which was originally announced in October 2022, cost Kroger $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report.

In late March, meanwhile, Kroger filed a legal response to Albertsons’ earlier lawsuit against it, which claimed that Kroger failed to exercise “best efforts” and to take “any and all actions” to obtain regulatory approval of the companies’ proposed merger deal. Kroger is now claiming that while it was working to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret campaign alongside C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts.

Kroger says that as a result of its misconduct, Albertsons is not entitled to the $600 million termination fee under the terms of the parties' merger agreement, nor is Albertsons entitled to other damages it is seeking. The alleged misconduct included incoming Albertsons CEO Susan Morris’ “secret communications with C&S's CEO and others, utilizing personal emails and cell phones to advance Albertsons's strategy.”

Albertsons contends that it was steadfastly committed to completing the merger, stating that “Kroger’s weak claims are a deliberate tactic to distract from its own ongoing executive leadership issues; blatant and recurring failures to carry out its contractual obligations under the merger agreement; and avoid paying the damages it owes to Albertsons.”",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2024-12/kroger-albertsons_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 17:06:25.227840

HOLMEN, Wis. (WFRV) – UPS is laying off dozens of employees in Wisconsin as it prepares to close one of its facilities in June.

According to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) letter submitted to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, the impacted facility is located in Holmen and will close permanently on June 10, 2025.

The closure will affect 42 workers, including 24 part-time package handlers and 18 full-time employees. UPS says it will try to minimize the impact by offering alternative roles where possible.

The layoffs will affect both union and non-union workers. Union employees, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, will have bumping rights—meaning senior workers can take positions from those with less seniority.

UPS says the move is part of a broader plan to cut $1 billion in costs across its operations.

“UPS has an unwavering commitment to serving our customers around the world. As we announced in January, we are making strategic changes to optimize the volume in our network, improve efficiency and continue to deliver on our customer-first strategy. The changes underway include closing a small percentage of our U.S. operations. Treating our employees fairly remains a top priority for us, and we will continue to provide industry-leading service to customers in every community we serve.

Health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans have long faced scrutiny for allegedly improperly reporting patient diagnoses through a method known as “upcoding” that qualifies them for higher payments.
Significant coding differences between Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare were evident in diagnostic categories such as vascular disease, major depressive disorder and diabetes with chronic complications, the paper says.
The study analyzed data from nearly 700 Medicare Advantage contracts managed by nearly 200 health insurers.
The study notes that UnitedHealthcare is the Medicare Advantage market share leader, but concludes that doesn't account for its disproportionate benefit from coding intensity.","Medicare Advantage insurers pocketed more than $33 billion in extra payments in 2021 by using billing codes that portrayed members as unhealthy to generate additional revenue, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Tuesday.

UnitedHealth Group subsidiary UnitedHealthcare profited the most from its ""coding intensity"" strategy, collecting $13.9 billion, or 42%, of the total, followed by Humana with $6.3 billion, Elevance Health with $2.1 billion, CVS Health subsidiary Aetna with $2 billion and Kaiser Permanente subsidiary Kaiser Foundation Health Plan with $500 million, researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and Actuarial Research Corp. found.

Related: UnitedHealth must face Medicare Advantage upcoding trial: DOJ

Underlying those extra payments were higher risk scores under Medicare Advantage compared with fee-for-service Medicare, the researchers determined using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data.

The average risk score for Medicare Advantage members was 1.26 in 2021, while the risk score for people with traditional Medicare was 1.07, the study says. The average risk score for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage policyholders was 1.35.

“Differential coding resulted in an estimated increase in revenue of $1,863 per member at UnitedHealth, substantially greater than the industry average of $1,220 per member,” the paper says.

Health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans have long faced scrutiny for allegedly improperly reporting patient diagnoses through a method known as “upcoding” that qualifies them for higher payments. The Justice Department is pursuing litigation against UnitedHealth Group over its coding practices and congressional leaders have demanded insurers turn over information on reporting protocols.

The researchers determined that diagnoses added during patient chart reviews and health risk assessments were main contributors to inflated payments. Significant coding differences between Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare were evident in diagnostic categories such as vascular disease, major depressive disorder and diabetes with chronic complications, the paper says.

The study analyzed data from nearly 700 Medicare Advantage contracts managed by nearly 200 health insurers. The authors acknowledge that demographics of plan members and patient health status may influence differences in risk scores, and potential under-coding in traditional Medicare may partially explain differences in coding practices.

The study notes that UnitedHealthcare is the Medicare Advantage market share leader, but concludes that doesn't account for its disproportionate benefit from coding intensity.

UnitedHealth Group rejected the study’s findings.

“This study is similar to others, relying on inaccurate assumptions and incomplete beneficiary information while ignoring the fact that Medicare Advantage serves an increasingly diverse, lower-income and clinically complex population,” UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. Humana, Elevance Health, CVS Health and Kaiser Permanente did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Better Medicare Alliance likewise criticized the findings. “It overlooks known under-coding in fee-for-service Medicare and does not adjust for clinical or demographic differences between Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, an essential step for fair comparison,” Kaitlyn Saal-Ridpath, vice president of policy and research, said in a statement. “Meanwhile, the underlying data is outdated and does not reflect recent risk-adjustment changes.”",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/medicare%20cards%20money%2024.png,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:27.723253

“In our experience, the U.S. consumer gravitates to brands they can trust during times like these.”","Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) beat expectations in the first quarter, delivering stronger-than-expected profits and expressing rare confidence in the face of Trump’s new tariffs.

The denim giant reported a profit of $135 million for the quarter ended March 2, a sharp turnaround from a $10.6 million loss in the same period last year.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at 38 cents, crushing Wall Street's estimate of 28 cents, according to FactSet.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million from Dockers, which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation.

The increase was driven largely by a 6% gain in Levi’s core Americas region. Direct-to-consumer sales surged 9%, while wholesale revenue slipped 3%.

“The Levi’s brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the center of culture across the globe,” said CEO Michelle Gass.

Analysts had projected revenue of $1.54 billion. Shares jumped 4.8% to $14.15 in after-hours trading Monday.

Trump's tariffs had no effect on Levi's guidance

Despite economic uncertainty and fresh U.S. tariffs, Levi’s is sticking with its full-year guidance.

Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh told investors most of Levi’s spring and early summer inventory has already arrived in the U.S., softening the tariff impact for the current quarter.

“We’re trying to put in place a mitigation plan where the impact to the consumer is minimal,” Singh said. “The tariffs have just happened, and so it’s a 24/7 job for the company.”

According to The Wall Street Journal, Levi’s has already formed a team to assess the implications of former President Trump's new tariffs.

Looking ahead, Singh said Levi’s expects “minimal impact” on second-quarter margins. He added that the company’s strong balance sheet and global footprint position it well to manage any disruptions.

Levi’s 2025 forecast excludes potential fallout from macroeconomic shocks, inflation, supply chain issues, and retaliatory tariffs.

The company sources its products from around 30 countries, with no more than 30% coming from any single nation. Fewer than 1% of its U.S.-sold products are made in China.

“It’s early days, but we’ve seen the consumer remain generally resilient,” Singh said. “In our experience, the U.S. consumer gravitates to brands they can trust during times like these.”",https://media.investorsobserver.com/images/featured-big/2025/04/levis-stock.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 20:05:17.592241

Levi's sees growth potential amid new tariff environment

Shares of Levi Strauss (NYSE: LEVI) rose Tuesday but swiftly came back to earth a day after the San Francisco-based denim giant reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit and gave a relatively optimistic outlook on the Trump administration's new tariffs. After the bell Monday, Levi's reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, above the $0.28 consensus forecast of analysts. The company also generated $1.53 billion in revenue, in line with estimates. Bloomberg reports that Levi's said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi also sees organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% this year. Shares rose as much as 16% — the biggest gain in a year — but that quickly evaporated Tuesday morning, later hovering around 1% above where it started the day. Overall, Levi's stock is still down more than 16% over the past five days.

The failed merger, which was originally announced in October 2022, cost Kroger $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report.

In late March, meanwhile, Kroger filed a legal response to Albertsons’ earlier lawsuit against it, which claimed that Kroger failed to exercise “best efforts” and to take “any and all actions” to obtain regulatory approval of the companies’ proposed merger deal. Kroger is now claiming that while it was working to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret campaign alongside C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts.

Kroger says that as a result of its misconduct, Albertsons is not entitled to the $600 million termination fee under the terms of the parties' merger agreement, nor is Albertsons entitled to other damages it is seeking. The alleged misconduct included incoming Albertsons CEO Susan Morris’ “secret communications with C&S's CEO and others, utilizing personal emails and cell phones to advance Albertsons's strategy.”

Albertsons contends that it was steadfastly committed to completing the merger, stating that “Kroger’s weak claims are a deliberate tactic to distract from its own ongoing executive leadership issues; blatant and recurring failures to carry out its contractual obligations under the merger agreement; and avoid paying the damages it owes to Albertsons.”",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2024-12/kroger-albertsons_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:06.805620

“We know shoppers love to be inspired and discover innovative tech from their favorite content creators,” said Jennie Weber, Best Buy’s chief marketing officer.

The company announced its Best Buy Creator program Tuesday (April 8) in conjunction with Best Buy Storefronts, a “curated shopping experience” where customers can shop tech from their favorite influencers and creators.

“Storefronts give creators the ability to create a one-stop shop to highlight tech features in their content and earn a commission on sales referred through their storefront, with no commission cap,” Best Buy said in a news release.

According to the release, a number of leading tech influencers are joining the launch with their own storefronts. These include Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips, who has more than 16 million YouTube subscribers and 8 billion views; tech reviewer Judner Aura, also known as UrAvgConsumer; and tech and lifestyle creator Jenna Ezarik.

Best Buy had hinted at the launch of this program last month during its quarterly earnings call.

“Influencers and creators will be able to build their own branded digital storefronts on Best Buy’s website, which we expect to drive increased traffic, engagement and sales,” CEO Corie Barry said at the time.

Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research has found that while influencers do live up to their name in convincing shoppers to make purchases, the picture is more complicated.

The report “Generational Pulse: Just How Influential Are Influencers?” found a considerable percentage of consumers make some purchasing decisions based on the recommendations, comments or links provided by influencers.

However, that share falls significantly in terms of regular purchases, with only 1 in 8 consumers reporting that they follow the lead of influencers when it comes to being incentivized to make frequent purchases.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Buy.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:18.479617

The auction comes nearly a year after Redbox filed for bankruptcy in June 2024, a downfall accelerated by the pandemic’s shift to streaming and compounded by alleged mismanagement.

For Redbox, a brand that once symbolized affordable entertainment, April 23 will close the book on a turbulent saga.","Redbox, the once-dominant DVD rental chain, is gearing up for one last hurrah as its assets—along with those of its corporate siblings Crackle and Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment—head to auction later this month. According to a court filing released Monday, the sale, scheduled for April 23 in New York, marks the latest chapter in Redbox’s dramatic collapse, which saw the company go from a billion-dollar business to bankruptcy in less than a decade, as reported by FastCompany.

The auction comes nearly a year after Redbox filed for bankruptcy in June 2024, a downfall accelerated by the pandemic’s shift to streaming and compounded by alleged mismanagement. The filing details a fire sale of intellectual property, including Redbox and Crackle trademarks, patents, and rights to hundreds of films and TV shows from Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment’s Screen Media Films subsidiary. Titles up for grabs range from cult classics like Jeepers Creepers to quirky Nicolas Cage starrer Willy’s Wonderland. While exact valuations remain uncertain, earlier filings suggest interest in the film catalogs has topped $100 million.

This comes as Crackle recently started to work again, as first reported by Cord Cutters News.

Notably absent from the sale are Redbox’s iconic red kiosks, once numbering 27,000 outside stores like CVS and Albertsons. Many have already been junked or sold for parts on eBay after retailers, fed up with unpaid fees and power bills—like Albertsons’ $184,000 monthly tab—won court approval to dispose of them. The filing doesn’t specify why the remaining machines aren’t included, but their fate seems sealed.

Redbox’s demise is a tale of missed opportunities and corporate chaos. At its peak in 2018, the company raked in over $1 billion, banking on a streaming pivot that never materialized. The pandemic slashed its revenue to $250 million by 2021, and a 2022 acquisition by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment for $375 million—laden with $325 million in debt—only deepened the hole. The parent company’s rosy forecasts of a DVD rental rebound proved “wildly unrealistic,” per the bankruptcy trustee, who last month sued former executives and board members, alleging they treated the firm as a “personal piggy bank” through exorbitant fees to the Chicken Soup book publisher.

The lawsuit claims these fees, peaking at $18.4 million annually post-acquisition, drained Redbox even as it couldn’t afford DVDs or employee health insurance. By early 2024, cash was so scarce that technicians couldn’t fuel company vehicles. The trustee aims to claw back these funds, with proceeds—along with auction earnings—likely funneling to primary lender HPS, owed $500 million.

For Redbox, a brand that once symbolized affordable entertainment, April 23 will close the book on a turbulent saga. As streaming giants like Netflix thrive, the auction offers a final chance for its legacy to live on—albeit without those familiar red boxes dotting parking lots nationwide.",https://cordcuttersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_1369138847-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 18:07:36.213019

Newman will replace Thomas Cowhey, who has held the role since January 2024.

Newman will assume the position on April 21. Cowhey will transition to a strategic advisor role to CVS Health President and CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

CVS also announced the appointment of Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips as executive vice president and chief medical officer, starting May 19. She replaces Dr. Sreekanth Chaguturu, who was promoted in November to executive vice president and president of Health Care Delivery for CVS Health.

The leadership changes are part of an ongoing executive restructuring led by Joyner, who was named CEO of the company in October 2024 as CVS works to rebound from a challenging financial year.

Despite the shakeup, CVS said it expects to “meet or exceed” its previously issued financial guidance for 2025. In February, the company reported projected cash flow from operations of approximately $6.5 billion for the full year. CVS said total revenue rose 4.2% to $97.7 billion during the fourth quarter.

The company had missed earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024 and withdrew its annual forecast in October.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” Joyner said in a statement. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.”

Joyner also praised Cowhey’s leadership, noting he “stepped up during a challenging year and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities.”

Newman most recently served as executive vice president and CFO at United Parcel Service. Before that, he spent 26 years in executive roles at PepsiCo.

Compton-Phillips was most recently chief physician executive at healthcare performance improvement company Press Ganey. A board-certified internist, she previously held leadership roles at Providence Health & Services and Kaiser Permanente.

Prior to his March 31 start at The Children’s Place, Szczepanski was CFO at Vince Holding Corp., a global retail company headquartered in New York City.
Like many other specialty retailers, The Children’s Place has evolved its brick-and-mortar approach amid the rise of e-commerce.
The Children’s Place also made two other leadership appointments recently: Kristin Clifford as senior vice president, head of sourcing; and Smeeta Khetarpaul, senior vice president, head of marketing.
Clifford rejoined The Children’s Place from Vineyard Vines, where she most recently served as senior vice president of sourcing.","The Children’s Place is making some changes to its executive leadership team.

The Secaucus-based children’s retailer recently added John Szczepanski as chief financial officer. In his new position, Szczepanski oversees finance, accounting, financial planning & analysis, tax, treasury, procurement, investor relations, internal audit and real estate, the company said.

Prior to his March 31 start at The Children’s Place, Szczepanski was CFO at Vince Holding Corp., a global retail company headquartered in New York City. His background also includes more than 18 years in various roles at luxury fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Szczepanski succeeds interim CFO and chief accounting officer Laura Lentini, who stepped in after Sheamus Toal left the company in December 2024.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the time, The Children’s Place said the decision to part ways was not the result of any disagreement. Toal began in October 2022 as chief financial officer and senior vice president. In August 2023, he also took on the role of chief operating officer.

“Today marks an exciting new chapter for our company as we welcome John to be our CFO,” said Muhammad Umair, who was named interim CEO in May 2024 following the departure of longtime CEO Jane Elfers.

“During this critical time in our planning and implementation of new business strategies, John brings a wealth of finance experience in retail and manufacturing that will help guide us through our company’s future development,” he said. We are delighted to have him join our team as we continue to build strong and efficient business operations and drive a financial strategy that can lay the groundwork for the company’s long-term success.”

Other team changes

The Children’s Place – whose brands include Gymboree, Sugar & Jade and PJ Place – has been busy trying to turn its business around. After warning of liquidity concerns in February 2024, the retailer saw a change in control when Mithaq Capital became its majority shareholder.

As part of a strategy shift, the company has made changes across its leadership teams as it looks to cut costs and pay down debt.

Like many other specialty retailers, The Children’s Place has evolved its brick-and-mortar approach amid the rise of e-commerce.

Higher rate of phone response: Compared to the industry overall, Indian dealers maintain an eight-point lead in the rate of phone response to customer inquiries, occurring 58% of the time on average.
The overall powersports industry average ILE score remained the same over the last year, both with ILE scores of 44.
There are two different key areas of improvement for powersports dealers, depending on their current performance levels.","Polaris Inc.’s Indian Motorcycle dealerships ranked highest in the 2025 Pied Piper PSI Internet Lead Effectiveness (ILE) Powersports Industry Study, measuring dealer response to internet sales leads coming through dealership websites. Following Indian were Harley-Davidson, BMW, and BRP’s Can-Am Off-Road dealers.

Pied Piper submitted customer inquiries through 2,523 powersports dealership websites representing 27 brands. Each inquiry asked a specific question about a vehicle in inventory and included a new customer name, email address and local telephone number. Pied Piper then evaluated the speed and quality of dealership responses by email, telephone, text message and chat over the next 24 hours. Each brand’s overall ILE Score is a combined average of their individual dealer ILE performances. ILE evaluations consist of over 20 differently weighted measurements, based upon best practices that are mathematically most likely to generate sales, combining into an overall ILE score ranging from 0 to 100.

Indian Ranked Highest for 3rd Consecutive Year: What Sets It Apart?

2025 marks the third year in a row the Indian brand achieved the top score in the annual ILE powersports industry study. The Indian brand improved its average score by one point for 2025, reaching an average ILE score of 56.

Answering customers’ questions more often: Indian dealers this year answered their customers’ questions by email/text 67% of the time on average, improving six points over last year and 17 points higher than the 2025 industry average.

Higher rate of phone response: Compared to the industry overall, Indian dealers maintain an eight-point lead in the rate of phone response to customer inquiries, occurring 58% of the time on average.

“Did both” for more inquiries: Indian dealers “did both” (answering an inquiry by email/text and also phoning, improving the odds of a response reaching the customer) 46% of the time on average, eight points higher than last year and 20 points higher than the industry average.

“The Indian motorcycle brand has maintained industry leading web-response behaviors during a challenging time in the powersports industry,” said Cameron O’Hagan, Pied Piper’s vice president of metrics and analytics. “Two years ago, when market conditions were more favorable, dealers could easily afford to expand their staff and refine operations. Today, however, tougher conditions have many dealers battling just to keep the lights on.”

How Did the Industry Perform Over the Past Year?

The overall powersports industry average ILE score remained the same over the last year, both with ILE scores of 44. Powersports dealers in 2025 improved phone behaviors and rate of response, but also experienced declines in other important areas, resulting in no overall change in total ILE Score

Behaviors That Improved

Powersports dealers in 2025 performed better in phone and text response, and the rate of dealers failing to respond occurred less often:

More phone response: Dealers this year were five points more likely to respond to online customer inquiries by phone, occurring 50% of the time on average.

Better use of texting: Customers were more likely to receive a text response answering their question, increasing five points to an overall rate this year of 30%.

Fewer failures to respond: Dealers failed to respond to online inquiries less often this year, occurring only 9% of the time on average.

Behaviors in Decline

There were two notable declines in behavior that held back overall industry score improvement:

Fewer emails answering questions: Dealers answered customers’ questions by email 27% of the time on average in 2025, down from 35% last year.

Not offering appointments as often: Only 10% of customers in 2025 received a response that included an offer to set up an appointment, in contrast to last year where it occurred 13% of the time on average.

What is the ’80/40 Rule’ and How Does it Relate to the Powersports Industry?

In the 2025 powersports industry study, 13% of all dealerships measured scored above 80 (providing quick and thorough personal responses), while 42% of dealerships scored below 40 (failing to personally respond to website customers). The “over 80” and “under 40” segments each shrank by 1% since last year, with a larger pool of dealers performing in the space between both categories.

“The effort to improve from the under 40 bucket into the over 80 is worth it,” said O’Hagan. “Historically, we have found that dealers who improve their ILE performance from scoring under 40 to scoring over 80 on average sell 50% more units from the same quantity of website customer leads.”

What is the Powersports Industry’s Greatest Opportunity for Improvement?

There are two different key areas of improvement for powersports dealers, depending on their current performance levels. One in four powersports dealerships currently fail to personally respond to website customer inquiries. For this group of dealers, the sole focus should be a commitment to always personally respond to online customers at least once each day.

“Just as you wouldn’t lock up at the end of the day with a physical customer still wandering around the showroom, don’t leave your digital customers hanging overnight in your digital showroom waiting for your reply,” said O’Hagan.

For the rest of the dealers, the step with the greatest opportunity is to embrace a reliable multi-channel communication strategy, rather than responding to customers using only email, only phone or only text. In this year’s study, powersports dealers failed to use multiple paths 74% of time, leaving many of their responses susceptible to communication breakdowns beyond the dealer’s control.

“Emails can land in spam/junk and be missed, customers often ignore calls from an unknown number and don’t listen to voicemail, and even texts can be lost or ignored among the large volume of messages many people receive per day,” said O’Hagan. “A consistent multi-pronged response to every customer is critical since you never know in advance which communication method will be most effective at reaching a specific customer. Then, once contact is established, adopt the successful method for future interactions with the customer.”

2025 Brand Performance Compared

Response to customer web inquiries within a 24-hour period in 2025 had large variations by brand, as shown by these examples:

“Answered Question”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question?

More than 65% of the time on average: BMW, Moto Guzzi, Indian, Ducati

Less than 35% of the time on average: Roxor, Kymco, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops)

“Phoned Customer”: How often did the brand’s dealerships respond by phone to a website customer’s inquiry?

More than 50% of the time on average: Harley-Davidson, Indian, Honda, Can-Am

Less than 30% of the time on average: Arctic Cat, Roxor, Moto Guzzi, Cub Cadet

“Offered an Appointment”: How often did the brand’s dealerships offer to set an appointment for specific date/time?

More than 15% of the time on average: Can-Am, Indian, Polaris, Segway

Less than 1% of the time on average: John Deere, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops), Cub Cadet

“Did at Least One”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question and/or respond by phone?

More than 80% of the time on average: BMW, KTM, Moto Guzzi, Harley-Davidson

Less than 50% of the time on average: Roxor, Cub Cadet

“Did Both”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question and also phone the customer?

More than 30% of the time on average: Indian, Harley-Davidson, Triumph

Less than 10% of the time on average: Kymco, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops), Cub Cadet

Why Was This Study Conducted?

“Customers today visit dealer websites first, and how dealers respond to those customers drives today’s sales success,” said O’Hagan. “The trouble is that website customers can be invisible in day-to-day operations which makes them too easy to overlook.”

For more than 15 years, Pied Piper has independently published annual industry studies that rank the omnichannel performance of brands and dealer groups. These studies track how industry performance changes over time and let clients understand how their own performance compares.

Pied Piper clients order ongoing Prospect Satisfaction Index (PSI) measurement and reporting — internet, telephone or in-person — for their dealerships as tools to improve and maintain omnichannel sales and service effectiveness. Pied Piper clients have found that the key to driving dealership improvement is showing what sales and service customers are really experiencing — which is often a surprise.",https://s18390.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Powersports-ILE-Trophy-50MM-LOW-LIGHT-LAMP.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 15:06:51.185965

LEVI’s Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

DTC net revenues reflected an increase of 9% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic basis to $787.5 million. Organic DTC growth was backed by a rise of 8% in the United States, 11% in Europe and 14% in Asia. E-commerce net revenues were up 13% on a reported basis and 16% on an organic basis. In the fiscal first quarter, DTC accounted for 52% of the overall net revenues.

Wholesale net revenues dipped 3% on a reported basis to $739.3 million. The metric rose 5% on an organic basis. Beyond Yoga revenues grew 10% on both reported and organic basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTC and Wholesale channels is pegged at $794 million and $749 million, respectively, for the fiscal first quarter.

In the Americas, revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis, backed

by double-digit growth in both DTC and wholesale channels. Within the Americas, revenues in the United States rose 8% on an organic basis, fueled by the high single-digit increase in both channels. In Mexico, revenues were up 6% on higher traffic in the stores and e-commerce growth. In Europe, revenues fell 5% on a reported basis but rose 3% on an organic basis.

In Asia, revenues were up 7% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic basis. DTC revenues rose 14%, driven by double-digit growth in the major markets such as Japan, Korea and Turkey. The company’s business in South Asia, the Middle-East and Africa, including India, grew double-digits on better in-store retail experiences, improved conversion rates and growth in wholesale units. Its business in China was flat year over year and management anticipates modest expectations in the current fiscal year as progress to reset this market is ongoing.

LEVI’s Margins & Expenses

The gross profit increased 8.9% year over year to $947.6 million. The gross margin expanded 330 basis points (bps) to 62.1% in the fiscal first quarter. This growth was primarily buoyed by lower product costs, including savings from Project Fuel initiatives, a favorable channel mix and brand mix.

Operating margin was 12.5%, up from 0.04% in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBIT margin jumped 400 bps to 13.4% compared with 9.4% in the last year, driven by gross margin expansion.

Adjusted SG&A edged up 1.7% to $744 million, reflecting increased distribution expenses. However, as a percentage of revenues, adjusted SG&A leveraged 70 bps to 48.7%.

Levi’s Other Financial Snapshots

Levi’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $574.4 million and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. As of March 2, 2025, long-term debt and total shareholders’ equity were $987.4 million and $2.03 billion, respectively. Total inventories jumped 7% on a dollar basis.

In first-quarter fiscal 2025, net cash generated from operating activities was $52.5 million and adjusted free cash flow was $14.1 million.

In the fiscal first quarter, the company returned nearly $81 million to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, up 12% year over year. This included dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of 13 cents per share and approximately $30 million in share repurchases, retiring 1.6 million shares. At the quarter end, LEVI had $560 million remaining in its existing share repurchase authorization, with no expiration date.

Management has announced a cash dividend of 13 cents per share, totaling roughly $51 million. This is payable on May 9 to its shareholders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of April 24, 2025.

What to Expect From LEVI in FY25?

The outlook for fiscal 2025 is based on the continuing operations, with the Dockers business now reported as discontinued operations. We note that the company’s guidance for the current fiscal year is unchanged except to reflect the Dockers business in discontinued operations. Management is prudent with respect to the global wholesale and anticipates the channel to be flat in fiscal 2025 on an organic basis. International growth is also a significant opportunity for the company.

LEVI’s fiscal second-quarter guidance remains consistent with its internal plan. The fiscal second quarter is seasonally the company’s lowest quarter for revenues and margins in the year. The tariff impact is likely to have a minimal impact on the margin structure in the impending quarter. For the fiscal second quarter, it projects organic net revenue growth from continued operations of 3.5-4.5%, excluding nearly 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds and 1.5 points related to the exit of Denizen and footwear business.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 bps and 100 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin is likely to be in the band of 5.5-6%. Adjusted EPS is envisioned to be 11-13 cents, reflecting about 3 cents of headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate year over year.

Considering such expectation, the company’s profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, approximately 20% compared with the first half of fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, reported net revenues are still expected to decline 1-2%, while organic net revenues are anticipated to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Gross margin is now predicted to expand 100 bps to 61.6%. Adjusted EBIT margin is now anticipated to expand to 11.4-11.6%, up from 10.9-11.1% guided earlier. This shows an expansion of 70-90 bps from a 10% base. It expects a tax rate of about 23%. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the band of $1.20 to $1.25, incorporating an estimated 20-cent impact of foreign exchange and a higher tax rate.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 14.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 30.4%.

Now in its sixth year and fifth growing season, the company, founded by Purdue graduate Kyle Albertson, uses drones to provide crop health mapping, pesticide spraying, and insect control, doubling its coverage each year. With a goal of managing 10,000 acres in the upcoming season, Albertson Drone Service highlights the growing role of Drone Technology in modern farming.

Drone Capabilities and Specs

Albertson Drone Service’s drones can spray 30 to 40 acres per hour, a significant improvement over traditional methods. While specific drone models weren’t disclosed in the Inside Indiana Business report, agricultural drones in this category, such as the DJI Agras T40, typically offer a flight time of 10-15 minutes per battery cycle when fully loaded, a range of 1.2 miles (line-of-sight), and a payload capacity of 88 lbs (40 liters) for liquid pesticides.

These drones use GPS and automated flight paths to ensure precision, avoiding obstacles like trees and power lines—challenges Albertson noted as non-issues for his operations. For exact specs on the Agras T40, refer to DJI’s official product page. Albertson’s ability to cover hard-to-reach field edges adds roughly 20 acres per field that traditional equipment might miss, enhancing overall yield potential.

Market Context and Competition

The agricultural drone market is expanding rapidly, driven by the need for precision farming. Companies like DroneDeploy and PrecisionHawk offer similar services, focusing on data analytics for crop health, while XAG and Yamaha provide competing spraying drones. Albertson Drone Service stands out in Indiana as the first licensed operator, giving it a regional edge. However, larger players with broader service portfolios and established client bases pose a challenge. The global agricultural drone market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 31.4% from 2023 to 2030, per industry reports, signaling fierce competition as more entrants adopt drone technology.

Regulatory Compliance

Operating agricultural drones for spraying requires strict adherence to FAA regulations. Albertson spent time in the FAA and 4-H programs before launching his business, ensuring compliance with Part 137 certification for aerial application and Part 107 for commercial drone operations. These certifications mandate pilot licensing, equipment registration, and adherence to airspace restrictions. Indiana’s regulatory environment supports such innovation, but operators must also comply with state pesticide application laws, which Albertson’s licensing covers.

Infrastructure Impact

Drones reduce the need for heavy machinery in fields, minimizing soil compaction—a common issue with traditional tractors like the John Deere model shown in the Inside Indiana Business feature. This allows for more sustainable farming practices, especially in Benton County’s corn and soybean fields. However, drone operations require charging stations, battery management, and pesticide refilling infrastructure, which Albertson likely manages from a mobile base. Scaling to 10,000 acres will demand robust logistics, including additional drones and trained pilots, which the company plans to address by hiring two Purdue interns this summer.

Industry Implications

Albertson Drone Service’s success underscores the potential of drones to address labor shortages and rising costs in agriculture. By covering 30-40 acres per hour, drones offer a faster, more precise alternative to manual spraying, reducing pesticide waste and environmental impact. This efficiency is critical as farmers face pressure to increase yields amid climate challenges. The company’s growth also highlights the role of ag-tech Education—Albertson’s Purdue background gave him a head start, and his internship program could inspire a new generation of ag-tech innovators.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Albertson Drone Service aims to double its 2024 coverage to 10,000 acres, a goal that will test its operational capacity. Advances in drone technology, such as longer flight times and higher payloads, could further boost efficiency. However, regulatory hurdles, like potential changes to FAA rules or pesticide restrictions, may pose challenges. As the ag-tech sector evolves, Albertson’s focus on local expertise and sustainable practices positions it well to lead in Indiana’s farming landscape, potentially setting a model for other regions to follow.

“If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.” Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp.
But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.","NEW YORK — Economy Candy’s shelves brim with sweets from around the world – gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.

Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop’s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.

“I think all of them,” Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.

Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.

Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.

“I think it’s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,” says 39-year-old Cohen. “If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.”

Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.

It represents just a blip in the country’s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.

Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers’ candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.

About a third of Economy Candy’s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store’s rear. There aren’t just “more German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,” as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.

They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.

On products like these, the tariffs’ toll is obvious.

Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.

But even an American-made Snickers isn’t immune.

While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars include chocolate from Guyana and sugar from Brazil and are wrapped in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.

“There’s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,” says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. “Unless you’re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what’s going to drive up prices.”

The story repeats with American candies across the store – the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.

A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy’s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.

As a kid, everything on the store’s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.

Now, Cohen can’t even get them wholesale at that price.

Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a “loss leader” but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he’s not sure he’ll be able to put off price increases.

“When your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn’t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,” he says. “But I don’t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it’s economical.”

The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention – the thousands of dollars a car’s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.

At its birth, the business Cohen’s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.

Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.

In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.

If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn’t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren’t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.

McDonald’s says its lemonade became a fan-favorite after it was tested in select local markets beginning in March 2023.

“What is the difference between premium lemonade and regular lemonade?” wrote the original poster, along with an image of instructions on how to serve the new drink.

“I think the premium one has pulp and is trying to be ‘freshly squeezed,’” replied one Reddit user.

“About seven letters and a space,” wrote another.

It should be noted that McDonald’s hasn’t completely broken up with Minute Maid, as it still has the brand’s orange juice on its menu.

Travis Knight is the son of Phil Knight, the man who revolutionized the sportswear industry through Nike. Travis is carving out his own legacy as the President and CEO of Laika the award-winning stop-motion animation studio.

Did Phil Knight Found Laika?

No, Phil Knight did not found Laika. However, he played a significant role in the company’s establishment. In 1998, Phil Knight and Travis Knight (then a 25-year-old animator) helped finance Laika as it was born out of a predecessor company, Will Vinton Studios. Travis Knight eventually took the reins at Laika and led it to international acclaim, particularly with films like Coraline, ParaNorman, and Kubo and the Two Strings.

Who Owns Laika?

Laika is owned by the Knight family, with Phil Knight being the primary shareholder. However, Travis Knight holds a prominent role in the company as its CEO and President, making strategic decisions and overseeing the creative direction of the studio. The family’s involvement in Laika reflects their commitment to supporting the creative arts and expanding their influence beyond the world of sports.

Is Laika Owned by Nike?

Despite the Knight family’s connection to Nike, Laika is not owned by Nike. While Phil Knight's wealth from Nike helped fund Laika’s early stages, the two companies operate independently. Laika’s focus is on creating exceptional stop-motion animated films, a world apart from the sportswear industry that Nike dominates. The collaboration between the two entities comes through the Knight family’s influence, but they remain separate, with Laika making its mark in Hollywood.

Laika’s Creative and Financial Success

Under Travis Knight’s leadership, Laika has earned a reputation for producing critically acclaimed animated films that push the boundaries of stop-motion animation. The company has enjoyed both financial success and industry recognition, with several of its films earning Academy Award nominations. Laika’s turnover has varied by year, depending on the success of its films, but it remains a well-funded, privately held company supported by the Knight family’s financial backing.

More About Travis Knight

Before becoming CEO of Laika, Travis Knight was an accomplished animator and the lead animator on several of Laika’s early films. His directorial debut, Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), received critical praise and an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature. His involvement with Laika has been instrumental in shaping the studio’s distinctive style and creative direction.

Today, Travis Knight continues to build on his father’s legacy, proving that creativity and business acumen can come together to forge a unique path in the entertainment industry.

Conclusion

Travis Knight has undeniably built Laika into the powerhouse it is today, delivering innovative, critically acclaimed films that have redefined stop-motion animation. However, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that his success didn’t come in isolation. The Knight family name alone gave Travis a major leg up, with Phil Knight’s wealth and support providing crucial early-stage backing. While Travis’s creative vision and leadership have certainly driven the studio forward, the financial foundation and network afforded by his father’s legacy undeniably played a role in Laika’s ascent.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:31.236138

And the first place they'll feel it is in parts of the store where the inventory has to move fast.
Grocery stores sell a lot of shrimp from Vietnam, which President Donald Trump hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, and India, with a 26% tariff.
Specialty coffee beans might eventually cost consumers 10% to 35% more than before the tariffs, bean buyers predicted.
Since the pandemic, grocery stores have been expanding their lines of lower-priced private-label products.","Grocery shoppers are likely to feel the impact of the Trump administration's sweeping new tariffs before April is over. And the first place they'll feel it is in parts of the store where the inventory has to move fast.

In the produce aisle, food analysts said Thursday, expect small price increases on everyday purchases like bananas from Guatemala and grapes from Peru, countries whose exports to the United States will incur 10% tariffs with the new fees, which went into effect April 5. A separate round of reciprocal tariffs on 57 countries will follow April 9.

The seafood counter may hold even worse surprises. Grocery stores sell a lot of shrimp from Vietnam, which President Donald Trump hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, and India, with a 26% tariff.

Soon, analysts say, price hikes will arrive for staples like sugar and coffee, which is already priced at a historic high. Specialty coffee beans might eventually cost consumers 10% to 35% more than before the tariffs, bean buyers predicted.

Since the pandemic, grocery stores have been expanding their lines of lower-priced private-label products. Customers loved them as a way to navigate inflation, but tariffs will drive up costs.

""It was a bit of a refuge for consumers,"" said Keith Daniels, a managing partner at investment bank Carl Marks Advisors, who focuses on the food and grocery sectors. ""Now that's not going to be there.""

Still, he and some food executives said that because so much food on shelves in the United States is processed overseas or contains ingredients and packaging from several countries, predicting how tariffs will change food prices is difficult, if not impossible.

Some of the cost of the tariffs is likely to be absorbed and not passed on to consumers, as retailers reevaluate pricing strategies and determine how long the inventory they already have in the country might last.

Still, the opportunity for price gouging or other forms of manipulation are high, said Errol Schweizer, a veteran of the grocery industry who publishes The Checkout Grocery Update, a newsletter.

""Consumers won't know if things are priced correctly or they are getting ripped off,"" he said.

At all levels of the food business, just figuring out the additional paperwork will take time. Walmart requires suppliers to give advance notice of price increases and clear documentation for them. But some businesses have yet to set up systems for recording and paying tariffs.

""It will take a year for all those costs to ripple through, but in 12 months you will absolutely see higher prices across the board,"" said Jeff Dunn, executive chair of Generous Brands and Bolthouse Fresh Foods.

Big food producers like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz are better equipped to absorb the impact of tariffs than smaller companies with relatively thin operating margins are. For those smaller players, staying afloat with the new tariffs will likely involve some fast, creative and strategic cost-cutting.

Last week, Paleovalley, a Colorado company that makes meat sticks and other products, was scrambling to mitigate the potential impact of the tariffs on imported monkfruit puree, an ingredient that is hard to source.

Ethan Frisch is the co-founder and co-CEO of Burlap & Barrel, which imports spices from 30 countries and buys exclusively from small producers. It has a shipment of cinnamon already coming on a ship from Vietnam. The farmers and the shipping company have all been paid. He has no idea if he will have to pay a tariff.

Because of uncertainties like that, he has decided to scale back on other goods the company was planning to introduce later in the year, like an Advent calendar filled with spice samples from around the world tucked into festive packaging manufactured in China.

Yun Hai, a specialty food shop in New York City, buys directly from rice farms, soy sauce breweries and mills in Taiwan, then ships the goods over in bulk, supplying grocery stores and restaurants across the country. The new tariff on those foods, most of which have no local substitute, is 32%.

""We're on the front line because we're the importer,"" said the company's CEO, Lisa Cheng Smith, whose most recent shipment of goods arrived a day before the tariffs were announced. She plans to examine creative ways to reduce other costs by 32% without losing her business.

The biotech on Monday appointed Sarbani Chaudhuri as its new chief commercial and medical affairs officer, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Chaudhuri comes to Rocket from Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, where she served at the VP level as head of hematology in the global commercial strategy organization. Throughout her three years there, she helped build out the business that includes multiple myeloma blockbuster Darzalex and rising star CAR-T therapy Carvykti, among others.

Chaudhuri spent nearly 20 years at several other Big Pharmas before joining J&J. At AstraZeneca, she was the global head of the breast cancer business unit and the Enhertu franchise, and in her six years at Pfizer, she held a handful of leadership roles across segments within the oncology and rare disease portfolios. Prior to that, she spent almost a decade on Novartis’ sales and marketing team, culminating in a stint leading the evolution of the U.S. oncology customer model.

In a LinkedIn post last week, Chaudhuri shared several photos to commemorate her “incredible journey at Johnson & Johnson” and to celebrate her colleagues and their shared accomplishments.

“I am incredibly proud of what we achieved together,” she wrote, adding, “At the end of the day, success is about more than just the science—it’s about the people who make innovation possible. I will carry forward the experiences, leadership lessons, and deep sense of purpose that I have gained here as I step into my next chapter.”

Chaudhuri is joining Rocket as it inches closer to a potential U.S. approval for Kresladi, a gene therapy to treat severe leukocyte adhesion deficiency-I.

Rocket initially submitted the therapeutic to the FDA for review in late 2023, with a decision expected the following spring. The agency pushed back that deadline to June 2024, around which time it sent a complete response letter (CRL) asking for additional information about Kresladi’s manufacturing.

In its full-year earnings release in February, Rocket confirmed that the FDA is now reviewing that supplemental info and that the company is expecting to be able to submit a full biologics license application (BLA) for Kresladi to resolve the CRL this year.

Meanwhile, Rocket is also advancing its RP-L102, aimed at treating the rare genetic disorder Fanconi anemia. Rocket said in the February release that the gene therapy is currently under review in Europe and that it has initiated a rolling BLA with the FDA for RP-L102, with the final submission slated for sometime this year.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1480578223.jpg?VersionId=sWIwXcl2tbc39NpNszKrzqYUYPj3vwpa,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:32.568179

The grocery chain hasn’t specified which locations are likely to be affected, but the closure process could reportedly extend over several years.
Kroger With nearly 2,800 stores nationwide, Kroger is pretty much a grocery powerhouse, but like other grocery chains on this list, Kroger has also begun closing underperforming locations.
The grocery store confirmed that it would close two of its stores located in California and Virginia.
The announcement was met with an outpouring of community support, demonstrating how these local grocery stores often become important fixtures in their communities.","As economic pressures mount and consumer habits evolve in 2025, the American grocery scene is undergoing quite a transformation. From retail giants to regional favorites, supermarket chains across the country are strategically reassessing their physical footprints, closing underperforming locations while aggressively pursuing growth in promising markets.

This shifting terrain reflects not just financial challenges, but deeper changes in how Americans shop for food in an increasingly digital marketplace. To that effect, here’s an in-depth look at nine major grocery retailers shutting down locations, the reasoning behind these decisions, and what these changes mean for communities nationwide.

Walmart

Walmart might seem untouchable with approximately 4,600 stores across the United States, but even the retail giant is feeling the economic pressure. The multinational corporation that’s been ranked as the world’s largest company in terms of consolidated revenue is closing several stores all through 2025, with locations in California, Georgia, and Ohio already shutting their doors.

The good news is that this isn’t a sign of Walmart’s demise. The retailer has ambitious plans to build or convert more than 150 stores over the next five years while remodeling many existing locations. Still, if you’re a regular at certain Walmart locations, you might want to check if your local store is on the chopping block.

Albertsons

Albertsons has been through a rollercoaster ride recently. After announcing a $24.6 billion merger with Kroger in 2022, the deal was ultimately blocked in court over concerns about market domination. The chain is now having to face the consequences alone.

In an earnings call in January 2025, Albertsons’ leadership revealed plans to close numerous stores as part of a streamlining effort, noting that their portfolio was “outsized” in certain areas. The grocery chain hasn’t specified which locations are likely to be affected, but the closure process could reportedly extend over several years.

The company is also looking to open stores in other areas as part of its restructuring strategy, signaling a strategic shift rather than a retreat.

Kroger

With nearly 2,800 stores nationwide, Kroger is pretty much a grocery powerhouse, but like other grocery chains on this list, Kroger has also begun closing underperforming locations. Stores in Nashville, Tennessee, and The Woodlands, Texas, for example, are shutting down due to redevelopment projects. The retail company’s 800 Monroe Street location in Nashville will temporarily close in May 2025 for a $22 million remodel.

In late January, Kroger announced the closure of its Belle Meade Plaza store in Nashville due to redevelopment plans in the area. Additionally, Kroger’s Sterling Ridge location in The Woodlands, Texas, will cease operations on May 6, 2025. The company cited changing shopping habits and competition as the primary reasons for this closure and announced that staff at affected stores will be reassigned to other locations.

Winn-Dixie

The beloved Southeastern chain Winn-Dixie has undergone significant changes since its 2023 acquisition by Aldi. Initially, Aldi focused on consolidating operations, announcing closures of four Alabama stores (two in Mobile, one in Phenix City, and one in Vestavia Hills) and a Georgia location. They also revealed plans to convert approximately 220 Winn-Dixie and Harvey’s Supermarket stores to the Aldi format by 2027.

However, a pivotal shift occurred in February 2025: A private investor group led by CEO Anthony Hucker acquired 170 Winn-Dixie and Harveys stores back from Aldi. This move ensured the survival of the Winn-Dixie brand in five key states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Southeastern Grocers now plans to modernize these remaining stores and expand their offerings.

Safeway

Safeway is experiencing a particularly tough year, with multiple locations set to close in California and Maryland due to safety concerns and financial pressures. In February, the chain shuttered its Webster Street store in San Francisco’s Fillmore District after 40 years, citing “ongoing concerns about associate and customer safety as well as persistent issues with theft”. Despite reporting strong sales in recent quarters, Safeway’s decision reflects broader challenges facing urban grocery retailers.

More store closures are on the way, including the Vallejo store on Admiral Callaghan Lane in the Bay Area, which is scheduled to close in April. The company is also closing its Appian 80 location in Pinole after serving the community for over five decades. This follows a failed redevelopment plan and expired entitlements under new property owners.

Shaw’s

Shaw’s, which operates 125 stores across the region, recently announced the closure of two locations in 2025. Stores in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire, will also be shutting their doors, though exact closing dates haven’t been specified.

“Like all retailers, we’re constantly evaluating the performance of our stores,” a Shaw’s spokesperson said in a statement. “Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we’re focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most”. Employees from these locations will be reassigned to nearby stores, but it’s a concerning sign for the regional supermarket chain.

The company stated these decisions were based on underperformance but reassured customers that nearby locations would remain operational.

Amazon Fresh

Despite Amazon’s seemingly unlimited resources and market dominance, its brick-and-mortar grocery concept, Amazon Fresh, is struggling to find its footing. The grocery store confirmed that it would close two of its stores located in California and Virginia.

These stores had only been operating for a couple of years before closure, raising questions about whether Amazon Fresh’s “frictionless” technology, which allows customers to simply walk out without scanning items, is actually appealing to shoppers. Some have already begun referring to these locations as “zombie stores”. While Amazon insists it remains committed to the Fresh concept, these closures suggest the e-commerce giant is still trying to figure out the right formula for physical grocery retail.

What is interesting to note is that while it is scaling back in the U.S., Amazon Fresh has expanded aggressively in India, reaching 170+ cities with 50% year-over-year growth.

Piggly Wiggly

Despite having perhaps the most charming name in the grocery business, Piggly Wiggly isn’t immune to 2025’s challenging retail environment. The iconic Southern chain is closing several stores this year due to lease expirations and declining profitability.

In March, a beloved Piggly Wiggly in Columbia, South Carolina, known as “The Social Pig,” announced it would be closing after 50 years of operation. Store operator Darrell Miller explained in a Facebook post that their lease had expired, and they were unable to negotiate terms that would allow the store to continue operating as a Piggly Wiggly. The announcement was met with an outpouring of community support, demonstrating how these local grocery stores often become important fixtures in their communities.

Dollar General

While primarily a discount retailer, Dollar General sells enough grocery items to make this list, and the chain is making some dramatic moves in 2025. In a Q4 2024 investor call, Dollar General announced it had conducted a “store portfolio optimization review” (corporate speak for checking which stores aren’t profitable enough) and would be closing 96 locations by early 2026.

The company is also converting six of its pOpshelf stores to Dollar General outlets and closing additional pOpshelf locations. For many communities, especially in rural areas, Dollar General provides essential access to groceries and household items at affordable prices, making these closures potentially impactful for local residents.

However, since the chain plans to open between 575–600 new locations in 2025, resulting in a net gain of 600 stores, this news shouldn’t be too concerning.",https://geekspin.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-exterior-of-a-Walmart-store.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 13:09:29.085716

The healthcare giant is seeking to right the ship after a series of financial challenges, particularly at its Aetna health plan division. Cowhey will vacate the CFO chair as of May 12, and will shift to serving as a strategic adviser to CVS CEO David Joyner, according to an announcement from the company.

Brian Newman, who most recently served as the chief financial officer for the United Parcel Service, has been tapped as executive vice president and CFO-designate, which will take effect April 21. Before his five years at UPS, where he played a key role in steering the company through the COVID-19 pandemic, Newman spent 26 years in financial leadership roles at PepsiCo.

Joyner said in a statement that he and the company ""wish [Cowhey] all the best in the future.”

""I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna,"" Joyner said. ""He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities.""

In addition to the CFO shakeup, CVS announced that Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as executive vice president and chief medical officer. Compton-Phillips will step into the CMO role on May 19, and was most recently Press Ganey's chief physician executive.

Compton-Phillips also held clinical leadership positions at Providence and Kaiser Permanente, according to the announcement.

Joyner became CEO of CVS Health in mid-October following the departure of Karen Lynch. Since then, the company has made a number of leadership shifts as Joyner builds out his team. Former UnitedHealthcare CEO Steve Nelson was named as president of Aetna, while Mike Pykosz, who previously led Oak Street Health, departed CVS.

The company also made leadership changes at the helm of its pharmacy division, and named Ed DeVaney as president of its Caremark pharmacy benefit management unit.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” said Joyner. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well-suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercehealthcare/1634483414/CVSpharmacy1.jpg/CVSpharmacy1.jpg?VersionId=VnOvP8PJGGMI2DxE2PaWrRSSwAAKb2ZF,N,,2025-04-08 13:10:01.589044

In mid-November, CVS announced the appointment of four new board members from Glenview, including the firm’s CEO, Larry Robbins. Glenview’s push came amid concerns over CVS’s performance and strategic direction.

Glenview’s impact was felt almost immediately at CVS. Its pressure led to the departure of former CEO Karen Lynch shortly after Glenview came on board and played a major role in the hiring of Joyner as CEO.

Newman’s hire likely stems from his experience steering UPS through the COVID-19 pandemic, a major union negotiation and the implementation of the company’s “1+2 strategy,” which aimed to grow revenue, cut costs and improve margins while navigating significant internal and external change. His background in managing large-scale logistics operations is also notable, as CVS Health aims to expand its health care delivery offerings while trimming expenses simultaneously.

How can retailers stay competitive while ensuring they meet these expectations and stay competitive? Global technology leader in supply chain and omnichannel commerce Manhattan Associates recently launched its 2025 Unified Commerce Benchmark for Specialty Retail, co-sponsored by Google Cloud and conducted by Incisiv, to evaluate how 220 North American retailers are demonstrating exceptional omnichannel commerce maturity and delivering highly personalized experiences to their customers, both in-store and online.

The biggest takeaway? Only 5% of retailers achieved ""Leader"" status, demonstrating the ability to consistently deliver the much desired personalized experiences.

Learn from the Leaders

The overall Leaders of the 2025 Unified Commerce Benchmark study were: Apple, Best Buy, Boss, Dick's Sporting Goods, IKEA, Lululemon, Neiman Marcus, Nike, Ralph Lauren and Sephora. On average, these Leaders achieved 31% lower fulfillment costs and 24% higher customer satisfaction.

A key finding was that from 2023 to 2025, the bar for unified commerce has risen dramatically. One-third (33%) of the capabilities that differentiated Leaders in 2023 are considered basic requirements today, while an all new set of unique capabilities defines Leadership in 2025:

Shopping experience: Today's consumers move seamlessly across channels and touchpoints. Multi-channel shoppers spend 15% more per order as they blend shopping across social media, online marketplace and brick-and-mortar stores. Leading stores understand this shift (which influences up to 34% of all digital discoveries) more than 1.5 times the industry average.

Checkout experience: Checkout must be reimagined to seamlessly blend operational efficiency with deeper engagement and personalization. 70% of Leaders offer intelligent cart experiences that sync and adapt across channels, compared to just 31% of others. Retailers treating checkout as a strategic touchpoint — optimized for today's generation of tech-savvy shoppers — see 20% lower cart abandonment rates than the industry average.

Fulfillment experience: Today's consumers — accustomed to same-day delivery, real-time tracking and flexible pickup options — are redefining fulfillment expectations. 50% of industry leaders empower customers to modify their orders and delivery preferences post-purchase, compared to just 13% of others, setting new standards for convenience and flexibility.

Service experience: Consumers don't see channels, they see relationships. They expect every interaction to build seamlessly on the last without repeating themselves, no matter who they're speaking to. 90% of Leaders have unified customer service touchpoints to ensure smooth transitions between store, digital and phone support. The result? They witness half as many support escalations, particularly related to orders, compared to their peers. Additionally, their rapid adoption of GenAI self-service agents should reduce support calls even further.

""Every aspect of unified commerce is a driver of business success, and true leadership requires unwavering focus on every stage of the customer journey — from shopping and checkout to fulfillment and service,"" says Ann Ruckstuhl, SVP and CMO at Manhattan.

As the commerce ecosystem transforms at a blistering pace, retailers must continuously evolve their unified commerce capabilities to move forward. Unified commerce integrates all aspects of retail operation, from online and in-store sales to inventory management, order fulfillment and customer data, into a seamless, unified system capable of meeting consumer demand.

Factors making the difference

Businesses succeeding in this complex retail ecosystem are leveraging the latest technology to enhance shopper experiences. The conventional wisdom that operational excellence requires trading off efficiency for customer experience is being upended. When done right, customer-centric innovation actually drives operational advantages across every metric.

Optimizing GenAI: While 77% of retailers deploy chatbots for self-service, only 5% harness GenAI to elevate that experience. These technologies can scale personalization, streamline complex decisions and extend human expertise across channels with unprecedented efficiency.

For example, GenAI can use a customer's purchase and preference history to fix problems — like missing items or returns — before they even complain. Agentic workflows can check inventory and process returns without staff intervention, helping streamline processes.

These technologies don't simply connect channels; they solve complex challenges that previously limited unified commerce potential. As these capabilities improve, faster adoption will redefine what's possible in connecting physical and digital retail.

Solving inventory challenges: Real-time inventory visibility drives revenue. Digital integration improves inventory visibility so retailers know exactly where their sellable inventory is — helping them overcome any disruptions and ensuring products they need are in the right place at the right time.

""The outsized impact of inventory on top-line revenue growth is evident. Inventory visibility, availability and seamless shipping have become critical levers for driving business performance in today's competitive retail landscape,"" explained Ruckstuhl.

Maximizing customer relationships: The 24% higher customer satisfaction rate among Leaders demonstrates that operational excellence results in loyalty. In fact, operational excellence and customer experience aren't tradeoffs anymore — they amplify each other and are redefining loyalty. Today's multi-channel shoppers don't draw distinctions between channels. They blend discovery, purchase and service, including returns, across channels, demanding consistent expertise at every touchpoint.

Customers who witness consistently convenient, trouble-free experience are more likely to remain loyal to those brands, whenever and wherever they shop.",https://d372qxeqh8y72i.cloudfront.net/3a4b1f6d-82db-47e8-bd31-c50f4f767417_wide.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:05:23.547302

Kearney Global Luxury Industry Outlook Reveals Key Trends Shaping the Future of the Market

The 21-page report, “Why stability is the new growth,” includes a detailed look at how brands have evolved over the past 30 years to meet changing consumer demands. In this post-pandemic period, brands are approaching growth much differently than they did in the 1990s and 2000s — an era of mass consumerism where the focus was on a back-end infrastructure capable of pushing out as much product as possible.

The researchers said brands are taking a hybrid model approach where they leverage wholesale for stability, direct-to-consumer for customer engagement and use marketplaces for supplemental reach, which reflects a shift toward a more methodical and resilient approach.

The report’s authors found that while 57 percent of brands surveyed are investing in retail relationships, “only 34 percent plan to enter new geographic markets. Growth strategies emphasize customer loyalty and sales diversification over pure optimization.…Key drivers include geographic and product expansion and omnichannel investments.” Meanwhile, the research showed that operational improvements (such as new warehouses or production facilities) “are a lower priority, reflecting a shift toward customer-facing growth rather than back-end infrastructure development.”

The report’s authors said wholesale continues to play a crucial role in stabilizing markets, shifting from a growth driver to a tool for optimizing distribution and controlling costs. Brands are prioritizing controlled growth, predictable pricing and stronger retail partnerships over rapid scaling via marketplaces or digital transformation.

In a cautious economic landscape, efficiency and relationship-focused strategies are taking precedence over risky expansion. Supply chain resilience remains a priority, emphasizing supplier collaboration, demand forecasting and contingency planning rather than structural changes like nearshoring. Meanwhile, B2B e-commerce platforms present untapped potential for deeper operational automation and integration.

Chris Akrimi, general manager for B2B at NuOrder said the new priority for many brands “is achieving sustainable growth while maintaining a strong focus on financial performance. Strategic, measured expansion is now a key consideration for both existing and new clients, a trend we see consistently across our portfolio.”

Akrimi said brands are doubling down on strengthening wholesale and retail relationships and optimizing distribution while expanding their networks, but they’re doing it with a more calculated approach. “They are seeking flexibility in pricing, contract terms and inventory commitments to navigate ongoing economic uncertainties that unfold daily,” he explained. “Rather than chasing broad distribution, brands are prioritizing ‘quality over quantity,’ choosing retail partners that offer long-term, sustainable growth. They are aligning with retailers that invest in brand storytelling, focus on sell-through and protect brand image, ensuring a balanced and profitable partnership.”

The report also looked at how AI can be leveraged by brands to increase operational efficiency and increase personalization. But the authors of the report said brands have been slow to implement the technology. The report said the current evolution of B2B e-commerce “will not reach its full potential without deeper investments in digital transformation and AI-driven efficiencies.”

Andrea Luna, client success team lead at NuOrder, said despite the clear value of B2B e-commerce platforms, many brands struggle, not due to technical limitations, but because they haven’t fully embraced a digital-first mindset. The real challenges lie in operational inertia, fragmented adoption and underutilization of existing tools. Too often, digital platforms are treated as supplemental rather than transformational, leading to missed automation opportunities and inconsistent buyer experiences.”

Luna said success requires more than just onboarding users; “it means equipping teams to leverage the platform’s full capabilities — building campaigns, creating custom lists and working seamlessly across devices. Brands that lead in digital transformation integrate intelligent, automated workflows that drive adoption and enhance efficiency at every stage.”

Yet, much of that tech, whether the finished product or the component parts, is made overseas and shipped to the US. This is especially true for the chips and processors powering all our devices and AI advancements.

As a result, the Trump administration's latest round of tariffs against international trade partners promises to impact the prices of your tech.

If you're in the market for some tech products, you're likely concerned about when the right time to buy is, when prices will increase, and how much they will increase. ZDNET scoured reporting from across the web that should help provide some clarity on your next steps.

The tariff impact

Because tariffs will impose higher prices on goods imported into the US, companies importing parts or devices from overseas will pay higher prices. How that trickles down to the consumer is a matter of how the company chooses to handle the additional costs.

Higher costs for goods typically leave companies with several options: absorbing the cost themselves, raising the prices of the items to offset the increased costs, or some combination of both approaches.

Some tech companies have already issued statements expressing their intent to increase prices for buyers. For example, in a February interview with The Telegraph, Jason Chen, the chief executive and chairman of Acer, said the company would raise its prices by 10% to cover the cost of the tariffs. In a March earnings call, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said price increases for American consumers would be ""highly likely.""

Other companies are shifting business operations to accommodate the tariffs. For example, Nintendo announced it was delaying its preorders for its upcoming Switch 2 in the US days after launching it to the public. The console is manufactured overseas, so the company is likely reevaluating pricing and costs.

A Wall Street Journal report claimed Apple was planning to send more iPhones to the US from India because of the high tariffs imposed on China. Since that report was published, Trump has passed sweeping tariffs across many more countries, including India. Vietnam, which also hosts major manufacturing plants for Apple, was also inflicted with tariffs in this latest wave.

As these examples show, price hikes for tech products are nearly inevitable. How much they will increase is to be determined, but some reports give us an idea.

A $2,300 iPhone?

You may have seen the headline about a $2,300 iPhone. Although Apple itself has not confirmed that -- or any -- iPhone price increase, the Reuters article that number came from does give users a clear understanding of how it reached that number -- and why it may be a viable reality.

Analysts from Rosenblatt Securities told Reuters that if Apple passes on increased component prices to consumers, the price of an iPhone could rise by as much as 43%. That would place Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, the top-of-the-line iPhone, at $2,300 if a 43% increase were added to the current $1,599 price.

To give another example, a research analyst at TechInsights told The WSJ that the iPhone 16 Pro's hardware (256GB) costs around $550, and the phone is sold to consumers for $1,100. The new tariffs could raise the hardware cost to $850; if the same profit margins are maintained, the overall price could increase accordingly -- by around $300.

Customers interested in new iPhones are already flocking to Apple Stores to make the purchases before the tariffs impact prices. A new Bloomberg report found that Apple Store employees across the country said that their stores were filled with customers panic-buying iPhones over the weekend.

Beyond iPhones, tariffs are bound to permeate other tech products and industries more broadly. To help conceptualize the impact, CBS News put together a price tracker with graphs depicting how much the impact could be across products most impacted by tariffs. Right now, it includes fruits and vegetables, cars and trucks, and raw materials, such as aluminum, which is often used in tech products.

Should you buy tech now?

Ultimately, the decision to buy tech is a personal one that includes many factors, such as your personal needs and disposable income. Based on the information above, it is safe to say that prices are expected to rise. So, if you really need something, now could be a good time to buy.

CVS Health named a new CFO Tuesday as the healthcare giant continues to shake up its leadership team.

Brian Newman, most recently CFO of shipping and logistics firm UPS, will start at CVS on April 21. Tom Cowhey, who took on the permanent CFO position at CVS early last year, will become a strategic advisor to CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

In addition to the leadership change, CVS said it expects financial results for 2025 to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance. In February, the company reported expected adjusted earnings for the year between $5.75 and $6 a share.

Dive Insight:

Newman will receive a base salary of $1 million, and his target annual equity award compensation will be $7 million, CVS said in a securities filing.

Cowhey will step down from the finance chief position about a year and half after he first took on the interim role.

He started at CVS in 2022, and then took on the interim CFO job in October 2023 after previous finance chief Shawn Guertin left due to family health reasons.

Cowhey will serve as strategic advisor and assist with transitioning his work until he leaves the company on a date that hasn’t yet been determined, according to a securities filing.

CVS also named Amy Compton-Phillips, previously chief physician executive of survey and patient experience firm Press Ganey, as chief medical officer, beginning May 19. She replaces Sree Chaguturu, who was named president of CVS’ healthcare delivery business in November, the company said in the filing.

The latest appointments come as CVS has made a number of recent leadership changes in recent months while it navigates a challenging financial environment.

The company’s profits were nearly cut in half last year as CVS’ insurance unit, Aetna, weathered heightened medical costs, particularly in government healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.

Joyner took up the chief executive post in October, replacing Karen Lynch as the firm pulled earnings guidance due to elevated expenses at Aetna. Weeks later, the company named Steve Nelson, previously the CEO of value-based primary care company ChenMed, as president of the insurer.

Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., is the company’s new executive vice president and chief medical officer, effective May 19, also reporting to David Joyner.

Based on year-to-date results through February, the Company currently expects financial results will meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for full year 2025. Our financial closing procedures for the first quarter of 2025 are not yet complete and, as a result, expected results for the full year may change due to such financial closing procedures, final adjustments, management’s review of results, and other developments that may arise between now and the time our financial results for the first quarter of 2025 are finalized.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” said Joyner. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.

“I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna. He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities. I wish him all the best in the future.”

“It is an honor to join CVS Health, its leadership team, and the Finance organization at such an important time in health care,” said Newman. “I am confident in our continued success and growth potential, and I look forward to putting my experience to work as we help our clients, customers, and colleagues succeed.”

“As a clinician, I see the best our health care system can do, and as an administrator, I have seen the challenges that stop us from doing our best all the time,” said Dr. Compton-Phillips. “CVS Health has every opportunity to deliver simply better health, and that starts with the patient-medical professional relationship.

Barclays is the latest UK company to drop some of its DEI targets, with others, such as the pharmaceutical company GSK, going as far as pausing diversity activities for UK workers.","Barclays has ditched gender and ethnicity targets for US staff, making it the latest UK company to bow to Donald Trump’s anti-diversity drive.

Managers at the US arm of the British lender will no long have to consider how new hires and promotions advance the careers of women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds, who have traditionally been overlooked in the banking sector.

The bank’s chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, made the decision after a review, which started late last year, into its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

A Barclays spokesperson said that the review was “still under way” and that “in the meantime, we have taken the decision to no longer have specific US representation ambitions. Our representation ambitions for the rest of the group will continue, and are being considered as part of the review.”

They added: “We remain committed to a culture which values inclusiveness and equality of opportunity across Barclays.”

The spokesperson clarified that the review, run by its head of DEI, Natalie Hattrell, began before Trump won the presidential election in November.

While Barclays had not set US-specific targets, its 11,600 US staff, including those in offices in New York, Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, were expected to adhere to global targets. Those included the goal of 33% of director and managing director roles being held by women by the end of 2025. Staff from under-represented ethnicities were also due to make up 50% of those senior positions.

Barclays is maintaining targets for the rest of its roughly 91,260 global staff, including the 43,180 it employs in the UK.

Venkatakrishnan said in the memo, first reported by Bloomberg: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US. As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

The US rollback comes two months after Venkatakrishnan, who was born in India, told journalists that Barclays had an “enduring commitment to a culture of inclusivity in the bank. It’s enduring and unwavering”.

“If you want to get the very best people, by necessity, you get a very diverse workforce,” he said during a full-year earnings call in February. “We want to provide equality of opportunity, and we want to create that inclusive environment in which people really can shine, excel and contribute to this bank. So that’s our approach, and we will continue to run the business and run the company in that way.”

Trump used executive orders after returning to the White House in January to reverse DEI policies in the federal government. While the orders did not directly apply to the private sector, he called on companies to follow suit, and asked the US attorney general’s office to consider how the rules could be more widely enforced.

It started a wide-ranging reversal, with several large US corporations, including Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford and Amazon, announcing plans to scrap or scale back their DEI schemes.

Barclays is the latest UK company to drop some of its DEI targets, with others, such as the pharmaceutical company GSK, going as far as pausing diversity activities for UK workers.

Last month City regulators at the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority controversially announced they were not planning to introduce new diversity and inclusion rules for financial companies and would instead support “voluntary industry initiatives”.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce589aab64301fc9823769f54385e5e1e9178382/0_318_5601_3361/master/5601.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5f737bcbfb7ae47c3a8c25b5f7735d4,N,,2025-04-08 13:09:33.918914

After shifting sourcing from China to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia during Trump’s first term, brands now face another spike in costs as President Trump introduces new tariffs on the latter countries, sending shockwaves through the global fashion supply chain.

Trump has introduced a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods, but the fashion industry is far from dealing with just that.

For about two dozen countries where the US runs a trade deficit, those tariffs are much steeper. Vietnam, a cornerstone of the global athletic footwear supply chain, is among the hardest hit. A new 46% tariff now applies to Vietnamese goods headed to the US, compounding the 20% duties already in place for textile-topped athletic shoes.

That’s a serious issue for the likes of Nike, which makes 50% of its footwear in Vietnam, and On, a Swiss sportswear company which manufactures a staggering 90% of its shoes there.

Vietnam is the world’s second-largest apparel exporter to the US after China, which itself is now subject to a 54% tariff, including earlier duties. Cambodia faces a 49% tariff, Bangladesh 37% and the European Union 20%.

The impact is already visible. In after-hours trading, shares of Lululemon fell more than 10%, Nike and Ralph Lauren dropped 7% and Tapestry, Capri and PVH Corp saw a dip of around 5%.

Fashion companies have little room to manoeuvre. Moving manufacturing out of Vietnam is no quick fix.

Production relocation: Easier said than done

Trump wants to bring production back to the US, but the fashion industry says it’s not feasible.

American factories lack the specialised equipment and skilled labour needed to make running shoes at scale. Nike, which first started manufacturing in Vietnam in 1995, now works with 130 supplier factories in the country. Adidas makes 39% of its footwear there too.

This week's tariff hike hits brands hard. Nike shares have dropped to their lowest in nearly eight years, weighed down by rising costs and competitive pressure from brands like On and Hoka.

While Nike hasn't commented directly, its latest quarterly report mentions ""several external factors that create uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment, including, but not limited to, geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, tax regulation and fluctuating foreign exchange rates.""

Supply chain ripple effects will be wide

The strain goes beyond big-name brands. The US Fashion Industry Association put it bluntly: “We are deeply disappointed by the Trump Administration’s decision to impose new tariffs on all imports. This action will particularly affect American fashion brands and retailers.”

From suppliers in Vietnam to textile makers and farmers worldwide, the entire chain will feel the pressure. Walmart, among others, has said it will negotiate with suppliers to lower costs, but many factories already operate on tight margins. The squeeze is set to intensify.

Retailers face a dilemma: absorb the higher costs or pass them onto shoppers already hit by inflation. With consumer confidence in the US already at its lowest since the pandemic, fashion brands are treading carefully.

And if costs are passed to consumers, expect more selective shopping habits and fewer impulse buys, which could dent profits further.

Washington Prime Group, according to a WARN notice filed with the state, will cut 139 jobs at its 4900 E. Dublin Granville Road headquarters.

A spokesperson for the company said the business has been downsizing as it sells assets in its portfolio – approximately half of which were sold last year with the remainder still on the market or soon to be.

Washington Prime owns more than 70 properties across the U.S. Its Ohio portfolio includes Polaris Fashion Place, Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, The Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek and the Lima Center in Lima.

But the company also is losing its office space through no fault of its own.

Its Dublin Granville Road headquarters also is the former Big Lots Inc. headquarters.

That building was acquired in February by OhioHealth.

According to court documents in Big Lots' ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, Washington Prime was notified in February the lease would be terminated. It moved into that building in 2023. It previously was downtown at the Continental Plaza.

Washington Prime declined to comment on whether it is fully eliminating its Central Ohio office presence and neither the WARN notice nor its statement to Columbus Business First acknowledged the lease termination.

The company also has corporate offices in Indianapolis.

The local cuts begin in June and could take until March 31, 2026 to complete, according to the notice.

“Internally, the company's strategy has been transparently communicated and understood for some time and WPG has worked closely with employees to ensure they have the resources and support needed to help them on their career journey,” Washington Prime said in a statement.

The majority of first-class mail, 75%, should notice no change to their first-class mail delivery services, the postal service said.
Union workers have argued that mail delivery is a vital public service that shouldn't necessarily turn a profit.","Changes are coming to how mail is delivered across the United States as the U.S. Postal Service continues to find itself in the crosshairs of a Trump administration determined to slash federal spending and increase efficiency.

President Donald Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, have not spared an agency that otherwise operates and funds itself independently.

The changes hitting USPS this month, which took effect April 1, are part of a 10-year plan, dubbed “Delivering for America."" Ultimately, the plan includes cutting jobs, adding a new fleet of electric delivery trucks to replace existing trucks that keep breaking down and slowing delivery for many rural customers.

The changes also come amid growing protests from postal workers and supporters opposed to service reductions, which USPS says will help save the organization $36 billion over a decade.

Here's what to know:

What is the USPS?

The United States Postal Service, older than the U.S. itself, delivers to 165 million addresses six times a week.

Although the postal service is technically an independent agency, Congress maintains close control.

But some critics who have long wanted to see the agency overhauled have pointed to the significant challenges the USPS has faced as Americans send fewer letters, Christmas cards and wedding invitations. Last year, the service handled more than 116 billion pieces of mail, with most of that being presorted mailers, solicitations, or other items that many people would consider ""junk"" mail.

Last year, the postal service lost $9.5 billion as private companies like FedEx and UPS outcompete it for some parcel deliveries.

10,000 jobs to be cut; postmaster strikes deal with DOGE

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy stepped down after inking a deal in March with billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.

DeJoy said the deal with DOGE, which has torn through the federal government to slash spending in the name of reducing waste, will ""assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.""

The deal came after the USPS announced in January a voluntary early retirement initiative expected to result in about 10,000 jobs being cut. More than 75% of the postal service's budget goes to paying its roughly 635,000 workers, and those 10,000 job cuts reflect only a 1.5% staffing reduction.

According to a news release from the American Postal Workers Union, workers who opt to retire early are eligible for a one-time $15,000 incentive paid in two parts.

Appointed during the first Trump presidency, DeJoy said in a letter to Congress that DOGE would help usher a “historic level of transformational change"" by reducing costs.

How will mail delivery be different?

The changes that went into effect this month will affect millions of customers across the country. While the moves are designed to improve efficiency and cut costs, some people may notice slower delivery.

According to the USPS, service standards will be ""refined"" for:

First-class mail.

Periodicals.

Marketing mail.

Package services (bound printed matter, media mail, and library mail).

USPS Ground Advantage.

Priority mail.

Priority mail express.

Delivery of first-class mail is expected to take no more than five days, while the 2-5 day range for USPS Ground Advantage will also stay the same, the postal service said. Certain postage like marketing materials, periodicals and other packages may even be delivered faster, according to the USPS news release.

The majority of first-class mail, 75%, should notice no change to their first-class mail delivery services, the postal service said. However, 14% will be upgraded to a faster standard, while another 11% of first-class mail will be delivered slower, though still within the 1-5 day deliver window.

For more precise expectations, the USPS is now using 5-Digit ZIP code pairs, rather than current standards that are based on 3-Digit ZIP code pairs.

USPS already has a map online that will let customers see how long it will take to deliver mail from one ZIP code to another.

More changes coming

The next changes are set to take effect July 1. More information will be released closer to that date.

Trump suggests merging USPS with Commerce; Musk wants it privatized

Trump, who has long been critical of the USPS and its declining deliveries, has in the past floated the idea that it be merged into the Commerce Department. Such a move would bring the now-independent postal service under Trump's authority.

“It’ll remain the Postal Service, and I think it'll operate a lot better than it has been over the years,” Trump said on Feb. 24. “It's been just a tremendous loser for this country.""

Musk has also suggested privatizing the agency, as many other countries have done. Such a move would likely require congressional approval.

Rural communities could be unequally impacted

Unlike the postal service, private companies do not have the same service obligations requiring delivery to rural or sparsely-populated areas – even at a loss. Companies like FedEx and UPS can charge higher prices for harder deliveries in such area, or simply not deliver to them at all.

Instead, those companies are more likely to focus services on areas with more people, more places and more profit.

In contrast, the postal service is required to deliver to virtually every address in the country, regardless of how much it costs. Some mail carriers even still use mules or horses to deliver to Supai, Arizona, a remote Havasupai tribal village in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, or float planes to serve fishing villages off the Alaskan coast.

Under a privatized system, mail outgoing and incoming to rural regions would likely be delayed. Service could become much more expensive or be cut off entirely.

Postal workers rally after DOGE threatens to dismantle USPS

News that Musk's DOGE team would be scouring the service for savings sparked recent protests across the U.S.

Thousands of unionized postal workers and their supporters rallied across the nation in late March to protest proposals to dismantle the U.S. Postal Service. Union workers have argued that mail delivery is a vital public service that shouldn't necessarily turn a profit.

Social media can be daunting for a business, from keeping up with trends to creating content to continuously posting across platforms. But, much like retail media, social media is becoming a must-have for grocers as one of the most effective ways to earn the loyalty and attention of Generation Z customers, sources say.

Gen Z shoppers already represent a significant portion of the market and are only growing. As of 2024, Gen Z shoppers made up 21% of the U.S. population and possessed $984 billion in spending power, according to Kantar Retail IQ.

Nearly 60% of consumers discover new products via social media, making social media the top channel for social commerce, according to a report from Inmar Intelligence. In addition, 78% of consumers consider a brand’s reputation on social media to be very important.

Most grocers post on multiple social media platforms, including the ones that are the most popular among Gen Zers, Instagram and TikTok. But while grocers are active on these platforms, an analysis of eight major grocers found that no one is posting consistently high-performing content. Likes, views and interactions vary largely from post to post, signaling that these companies haven’t found ways to build a loyal, engaged follower base.

Grocers continue to struggle to gain a consistent, loyal traction on social media

Grocers' follower and like counts on TikTok and Instagram, respectively, as of April 8, 2025

Based on a scroll through each grocer’s Instagram and TikTok profiles, it’s clear that these retailers tend to stick to videos that show off their products. Whether these posts are cooking demos, ingredient bundles or creative food hacks, they typically mimic influencer-style videos. Though this strategy makes sense, grocer’s posts still receive limited traction.

There’s a solution to this, however: Let full-time influencers and content creators themselves take the lead in grocers’ social media marketing, according to Ranjana Choudhry, senior vice president of media and data platforms for Inmar Intelligence.

If you can’t beat them, join them

Why try to become an influencer when you have a grocery business to run?

Influencer partnerships, including giveaways, sponsorships, product reviews and collaborative content creations, are expected to become more popular in the overall marketing landscape.

Already, 59% of marketers reported plans to partner with more influencers this year compared to 2024, sister publication Marketing Dive reported using data collected by Sprouts Social. Business-to-consumer brands, which include grocers, tend to engage in a higher volume of influencer partnerships compared with the average.

To resonate with shoppers through social commerce, retailers must create an environment that “revolves around meaningful, discovery-driven interactions” that pair entertainment with the path to purchase, according to Inmar’s report. While grocers can begin to build this on their social media pages, influencers offer a more direct path.

More than 80% of consumers purchase items based on creator recommendations, according to Inmar. Even if the influencer has a limited following, 80% of surveyed consumers reported they would buy something on social media based on “a random piece of creator content, regardless of follower size,” Inmar found.

Influencers also allow for more flexibility in the social commerce space. TikTok is all the rage — hence why even neighborhood grocery stores are making videos on the platform — but the platform’s 12-hour shutdown in January caused marketers to see a “significant drop in their reach and engagement,” according to the report. While audiences may not refollow their go-to grocery company on another social media platform, they are likely to follow their favorite creators and communities “wherever they go,” Inmar said.

“For the first time, brands and retailers can actually combine this creator-authentic content and authentic following with very clear targeting to retail customers,” Choudhry said. “So there is a lot of affinity that [retailers] can drive.

Creating authenticity, measuring impact

Authenticity is something that can only come from influencers, because even if a retailer posts so-called relatable content, viewers will still see it as a traditional advertisement rather than content, according to Inmar, adding that 73% of consumers trust creators as much or more than traditional advertisements.

However, there is a way to translate this authenticity — and that’s where retail media networks come into play.Grocers can use their retail media networks to scale creator content made for their company across digital platforms. This would enable companies to more accurately measure the impact and performance of an influencer’s content as well as allow them to tap into a creator’s “trust factor” across their follower base, Inmar said.

This more tangible feedback on creator content performance and impact will also help retailers know which influencers are best to partner with, as it will allow them to select creators whose follower base is likely to drive sales performance.

Without this technology and the ability to connect audiences to purchase power, retailers would be forced to assume or guess, Choudhry said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-Rjqfr0495DEaoNWWLIWPzz11Ehry2GYERo-2mIZtRE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjI3OTUyMzY0XzFfWG9GSW0wYi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:30.818195

Business: Co-founder and former CEO/Chairman of Nike, Inc.

Net Worth: Approximately $40 billion (as of 2025)

Spouse: Married to Penny Knight

Few names are as synonymous with modern sportswear and brand dominance as Phil Knight. What began as a modest idea in the mind of a University of Oregon track athlete eventually became Nike, one of the most recognized and profitable companies in the world. Knight’s journey wasn’t just about building a shoe company — it was about transforming global athletic culture.

The Humble Beginnings: Blue Ribbon Sports

In 1964, Knight teamed up with his former track coach Bill Bowerman to start Blue Ribbon Sports, originally a distributor for Japanese running shoes from Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS). Knight sold the shoes out of his car at track meets while balancing an accounting job — an image that would soon contrast sharply with the billion-dollar empire Nike would become.

The Birth of Nike

In 1971, after parting ways with Onitsuka, the partners launched Nike, Inc., named after the Greek goddess of victory. The iconic Swoosh logo was created by a graphic design student for just $35 — a branding move that would become one of the most valuable trademarks in history.

Knight’s early focus was on performance and innovation — lightweight shoes with improved cushioning and traction. But it was bold marketing (think: ""Just Do It"") and celebrity athlete partnerships (like signing Michael Jordan in 1984) that catapulted Nike into the stratosphere.

The Mastermind Behind the Brand

Phil Knight served as CEO of Nike from 1964 to 2004, and remained Chairman until 2016. During his leadership, Nike grew from a scrappy startup to a $180+ billion global powerhouse, dominating the market in footwear, apparel, and equipment.

Knight is known for his unconventional, fiercely competitive business style — blending intuition with strategic risks. His memoir Shoe Dog reveals many of the hurdles and near-failures Nike overcame on its way to global domination.

Does Phil Knight Still Own Nike?

Yes, Phil Knight still owns a significant portion of Nike. Through Swoosh LLC, a holding company, Knight and his family own about 22% of the company, making them the largest individual shareholders. His son, Travis Knight, also holds substantial shares and is involved in the family’s business interests.

Who’s the Biggest Shareholder in Nike?

Individual: Travis Knight (via trust) – approx. 17.8%

Institutional:

The Vanguard Group – approx. 7.1%

BlackRock – approx. 5.5%

The Knight family still exerts considerable influence over the company, despite Phil having stepped back from an active leadership role.

How Long Was He CEO?

Phil Knight served as the CEO of Nike for an impressive 40 years, leading the company from its founding in 1964 until his retirement in 2004. Even after stepping down as CEO, Knight remained deeply involved with the company, serving as Chairman of the Board until 2016.

Shoe Dog: The Story Behind the Swoosh

If you want an unfiltered look into the trials, triumphs, and sheer chaos behind building a global brand, Shoe Dog is a must-read. In this candid memoir, Phil Knight shares the gritty, behind-the-scenes journey of launching Nike from selling sneakers out of the trunk of his car to facing financial ruin and navigating global success. It’s not just a business book, it’s a story about passion, risk, resilience, and chasing a crazy dream.

What Does the Nike CEO Make Now?

As of 2024, Elliott Hill has taken over as the new CEO of Nike, stepping into one of the most high-profile roles in the sportswear industry. Hill’s annual compensation package is estimated to be around $27 million, which includes a combination of base salary, performance bonuses, and stock options. His earnings are slightly below those of his predecessor, John Donahoe, who earned approximately $29.1 million in 2023. Despite the shift in leadership, Nike continues to reward its executives generously, reflecting the company’s ongoing global influence and profitability.

Phil Knight’s Legacy

Phil Knight didn’t just build a company he built a culture. From innovation in footwear to game-changing marketing and brand loyalty, Knight’s vision helped make Nike not just a product, but a global symbol of ambition, athleticism, and edge. His journey remains a blueprint for entrepreneurs across industries.

He transformed a small footwear brand into a global empire that spans across high fashion to everyday consumer wear. With its iconic Swoosh and powerful marketing, Nike has become synonymous with both athletic performance and cutting-edge style.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:37.497179

Why ‘Raising Prices Is The Most Viable Path Forward’ Morgan Stanley Research said that “raising prices” for products” is the “most viable path forward” for hardware companies it covers.
For instance, “there is little flexibility to pull forward/stockpile inventory, and diversifying supply chains takes too long,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

The research arm of global banking giant Morgan Stanley called President Trump’s across-the-board tariffs a “lose-lose” situation for hardware companies such as Apple, Dell Technologies and HP Inc., saying that “raising prices” for products is their “most viable path forward.”

Morgan Stanley Research delivered the assessment in a research note last Thursday, a day after Trump announced so-called “reciprocal tariffs” ranging from 25 percent to 54 percent for goods coming out of roughly 60 countries and regions, which he said are meant to boost the U.S. economy and “protect American workers.”

[Related: ‘Confusion,’ ‘Uncertainty,’ ‘Pain’: Solution Providers Grapple With Trump’s Tariff Regime]

These new tariffs are set to go into effect Wednesday, with goods from Asian manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand expected to face tax rates of 46 percent, 32 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Since the report came out, Trump has warned that he will impose an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which would bring total import taxes to 104 percent for such things, in response to China’s counter-tariffs on U.S. products.

While some of the targeted countries and regions have said they are seeking new trade deals with the U.S. to remove tariffs, China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and continue countermeasures in response to Trump’s latest threat, the Associated Press reported.

Trump has indicated he is open to striking trade deals, saying on Tuesday that he spoke with South Korea’s acting president about a potential deal while saying that China “wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started.”

Dell, HP Say They Have ‘Agile’ And ‘Resilient’ Supply Chains

A Dell spokesperson told CRN on Monday that the Round Rock, Texas-based company is “reviewing and assessing the impact of the tariffs announced last week.”

“Dell has a strong track record of leading through any environment with our globally resilient and agile supply chain,” the representative said in a statement.

In a statement to CRN, an HP spokesperson said Tuesday that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company “has an agile and resilient supply chain that helps us adapt to the evolving economic landscape to ensure we deliver for our partners and customers.”

“Our strong relationships with supply chain partners around the world allow us to remain agile and responsive to changes, as we are not tied primarily to company-owned infrastructure or factories in countries heavily impacted by tariffs,” the representative said.

“We will continue to monitor developments and have the ability to adjust operations as needed,” the HP spokesperson added.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Why And How Tariffs Will Hit Apple, Dell And HP

Morgan Stanley Research said the tariffs “add to the growing list of concerns” it has for the hardware companies it covers, which include Apple, Dell and HP. Other companies in the firm’s coverage that will be impacted by tariffs include Logitech, Sonos, Garmin and GoPro.

“As we highlighted last week, policy uncertainty, deteriorating business/consumer sentiment, and worsening macro data have resulted in slowing enterprise hardware spending growth and persistently negative consumer electronics spending intentions since late February,” the firm wrote.

“Yesterday's reciprocal tariff announcements will likely amplify these headwinds,” it added.

That’s because companies like Apple, Dell and HP “rely on extensive international manufacturing, with the large majority of finished goods sold into the U.S. assembled in [southeast] Asian Nations, making them [the] worst positioned” among the companies it covers, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

Many of these hardware companies, including Apple, Dell and HP, started reducing their reliance on manufacturing in China in 2018 during the first Trump administration, the firm said. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, for instance, has moved roughly 15 percent of iPhone production to India since then, and all its MacBooks for the U.S. market are now made in Vietnam.

Dell and HP, on the other hand, “diversified U.S.-bound notebook production to Vietnam and Thailand, respectively,” Morgan Stanley Research added.

While shifting production outside China was previously seen as a way for these vendors to lower their exposure to tariffs, this is no longer the case, the firm said.

That’s because Trump has cast a wide net with his latest round of tariffs, hitting countries like Thailand and Vietnam that were previously seen as safe for U.S. vendors to use as manufacturing hubs, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

“With yesterday's reciprocal tariff announcement, there becomes very little differentiation in friend shoring vs. manufacturing in China—if the product is not made in the U.S., it will be subject to a hefty import tariff,” the firm wrote.

Given Apple’s exposure to tariffs due to its reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs, the iPhone giant would face an estimated additional cost of $33 billion annually, which would represent 26 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

For Dell and HP, “the added tariff cost could equate to nearly the entirety of their expected net [incomes] in 2025,” the firm added.

Why ‘Raising Prices Is The Most Viable Path Forward’

Morgan Stanley Research said that “raising prices” for products” is the “most viable path forward” for hardware companies it covers.

That’s because the widespread nature of the tariffs makes most of their other mitigation tools “ineffectual,” according to the firm.

For instance, “there is little flexibility to pull forward/stockpile inventory, and diversifying supply chains takes too long,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

As for absorbing the extra costs created by tariffs, this would guarantee a “significant margin headwind” for impacted vendors, the firm added.

These companies could consider redirecting products to markets without tariffs, “but it would depend on the usable infrastructure available,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

As a result, the firm considers the tariffs a “lose-lose” situation for hardware vendors.

“Raising prices is the most likely mitigation tool, in our view (all imports now face tariffs, so the playing field has been somewhat leveled), but it's inflationary and guaranteed to negatively impact demand, given the severity of some pricing increases,” it wrote.

Could Shifting Production To The U.S. Be The Answer?

Morgan Stanley Research said it’s “unlikely” that hardware companies would ever shift production to the U.S., citing cost, time and resources as well as expertise and policy uncertainty as “barriers to entry.”

The firm said it would cost “hundreds of billions of dollars” to stand up manufacturing plants in the U.S., “not even counting the wage disparities between [southeast] Asia and the U.S.” For example, Apple supplier Foxconn spent more than $1.5 billion, inclusive of perks like lower power costs and subsidies as well as tax breaks, to build a manufacturing complex in China that produces roughly 50 percent of the world’s iPhones, it said.

“Standing up a manufacturing facility in the U.S. would take, at the very minimum, 9 months with a running start and labor availability. Most likely, it would take years. And then there is the question of available labor in the U.S.,” the firm said.

“We'd presume that even with automation/humanoids/robots, there aren't enough skilled workers in the US with expertise in tooling,” it added.

The uncertainty over U.S. policy will also hold back companies from investing in domestic manufacturing capacity, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

That’s because with Trump in his second term as president, policy “could be vastly different” in four years, the firm said.

“For an industry facing hundreds of billions of dollars in costs to set up shop in the U.S. [versus] tens of billions in tariffs, tariffs still feel like the less bad choice,” it wrote.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2025/media_102796514d0be18e650a772ece46277cdf28ce3be.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:13.018260

“The last two recessions the pharma industry has fared pretty well,” Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, told BioSpace.
“Before we go overboard, [pharma’s] still recession resistant,” Wong said.
Jefferies said that the macro uncertainties due to the tariffs “have triggered a continued flight to safety,” on the markets.
“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks explained.","With GLP-1s making the pharma industry more exposed to consumer spending than ever, the tariff chaos could break pharma’s recession-resistant reputation.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If the world does indeed fall into a recession following the widespread tariffs put into place by President Donald Trump—as many indicators are suggesting it will—pharma could be particularly vulnerable. With the U.S. population growing older and suffering from more chronic diseases, personal healthcare expenses are on the rise for everyday people who could be forced to make difficult decisions like skipping medications.

The most significant recession in recent memory was the 2008 financial crisis, which was spurred by the collapse of the housing market and financial systems in the U.S. More recently, a shorter recession cropped up due to the pandemic. In both cases, pharma was largely immune. You have to buy your medicines even if the economy is tanking.

“The last two recessions the pharma industry has fared pretty well,” Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, told BioSpace. “People can’t really skip their prescriptions.”

According to Jefferies, pharma outperformed the S&P 500 through both recessions and in the years immediately following, because the industry is “overall a more defensive beneficiary of money flow in economic downturns.”

In the case of COVID, biopharma even enjoyed an influx of funds as investors poured money into the industry as it raced to develop vaccines and medicines that could stymie the rampant global outbreak. Jefferies said that pharma outperformed the S&P 500 by about 10-20% during that recession.

But this time around, things are different, experts say. Since those two events, GLP-1s have risen precipitously, but insurance coverage has not followed as neatly. That means the market has been defined by consumers, with many more patients pocketing the costs of GLP-1 medicines themselves. Trump also just nixed an executive order from his predecessor Joe Biden that expanded Medicare coverage for the therapies, cutting off another avenue for access—at least for now.

Wong told BioSpace he expects GLP-1s to take a hit if a recession does settle in. “You’ll still see growth,” he predicted, “it’s just that you will see a slowdown in adoption with things like this,” as patients back off paying out-of-pocket for weight loss medications.

Moreover, healthcare has grown as a larger portion of the GDP since the early 2000s, Wong noted. The population has aged, meaning more of them have chronic health conditions and are taking prescriptions for longer. Healthcare is becoming a larger part of people’s personal budgets. It remains to be seen how they will weather a recession.

“Depending on when the next recession hits, how deep it is, is it going to have a bigger impact?” Wong asked. “I would guess yes.”

Paying Up Front

Before the recession fears, insurance companies had faced increasing pressure to open up coverage of obesity medications. Wong said he thinks that now is not the right time to try to convince insurance companies to shoulder the cost because they are facing the same macro headwinds as any other industry and are beholden to their shareholders.

“The health insurers are all struggling and trying to control their medical-cost ratios,” he said.

The argument posed by companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the GLP-1 market leaders with tirzepatide and semaglutide, respectively, has been that their products can eliminate downstream health challenges. Both have pursued indications beyond just weight loss. Semaglutide, approved as Wegovy for weight loss, has been approved for reducing cardiovascular risk and for kidney disease, while Lilly nabbed an FDA nod for sleep apnea for Zepbound. Insurers just will not see this as the right time to make that down payment, Wong said.

“I think they can agree that they see savings down the road, but are they willing to pay for it up front? And is there money in the budget right now to pay upfront?” Wong asked. “They buy into [the idea of these drugs]. It’s just at what level of adoption [and] how aggressively can they provide coverage in this current environment.”

Even with covered drugs, the out-of-pocket expenses can be high. While it’s easy to assume that people will continue taking their medicine, Wong said that during the previous recessions, there were reports of “pill-splitting,” when people cut doses to make their prescriptions last longer or delay refilling.

“Before we go overboard, [pharma’s] still recession resistant,” Wong said. “I don’t think it was ever recession proof, but it is still recession resistant. I think it becomes less recession resistant as we go on, just because healthcare spending is a bigger part of the pie in terms of people’s budgets.”

The Tariff Threat

This moment for GLP-1s also comes as pharmas are directly battered by tariff uncertainty,, which Wong says the industry has “sidestepped”—for now.

Shares of Eli Lilly, now the largest pharma by market cap, have declined 12% in one month from a high of $864 apiece on March 24, wiping out $95.4 billion in market value. Novo, which takes the fourth slot below Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie in terms of market cap, has lost $72.4 billion in market value in the same time period, with shares falling 26% in one month to $63.64 at close Monday.

Jefferies said that the macro uncertainties due to the tariffs “have triggered a continued flight to safety,” on the markets.

“We expect macro to have the steering wheel,” the firm said.

Lilly CEO David Ricks told the BBC last week of the tariffs that “it’ll be hard to come back from here.” While much of the innovation in pharma is done in the U.S., Ricks said that the industry relies on global locations for production, including active pharmaceutical ingredients.

According to a recent survey from the industry group BIO, nearly 90% of all U.S. biopharma companies rely on imported API for FDA-approved products. If tariffs were imposed on Europe, half of companies would have to find new research and manufacturing partners, while 79% with Chinese contracts would be greatly impacted if that country is levied with huge tariffs.

“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks explained. Those trade-offs would include layoffs and reductions in R&D first and foremost, which Ricks called “a disappointing outcome.”

One expert who spoke to Truist Securities called the panic an overreaction and instead insisted that it’s a great time to be investing in biopharma. This person “sees this whole process of tariffs as a ‘revolution,’” to bring assets back to the U.S. to guard against unforeseen events like a war or another pandemic.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/d1fe95c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/985x554+8+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2Fee%2F3149943c4100a14a46aaeed7a311%2Funtitled-1000-x-563-px-2.png,N,,2025-04-08 16:05:28.014530

Still, the company says it may be required to modify sourcing practices which could impact product costs. Joining us now, Harmeet Singh is Levi Strauss's chief financial and growth officer. Harmeet, it's great to speak with you. So you are keeping your forecast, but you said that it assumes no deterioration in the macro environment. Can guidance be guidance right now if it does not include the impact of tariffs?

Good morning. Thanks for having me here. Um, as you know, we reported a very strong start to the year, our quarter one beat top line and bottom line expectations. Revenue, organic revenue accelerated and we were up 9%. Our EBIT margins expanded and we're up 400 basis points and EPS was up 50, uh you know, 52%. So overall, real strong start to the year. Our transformation strategies are working as we pivot to a DDC first lifestyle company. Um you know, our DDC results, which is direct to consumer, which includes our stores and e-commerce, uh you know, it was up 12%, 12 consecutive quarter of growth and what I like to call a tri-fecta, which is, you know, we're growing compsales, we're adding profitable new stores and we're growing e-commerce. And so, you know, a real strong start to the year and good momentum. To your question about guidance, medicine, um, it's uh, it's early days. Yes, the tariffs, uh, that were imposed have created more uncertainty. We are best positioned to navigate it. Uh, the situation is very fluid. Um, and the way we think of guidance is it's important to give expectations when we are clear, uh, about uh the expectations. We were very clear about quarter two and we guided quarter two, which is again, uh, you know, growing 3 and a half to 4 and a half percent on an organic basis. Gross margins continue to improve and we guided our EPS expectations. Uh, and so that's the reason we stuck with the full year guidance. Uh, you know, uh, just before the announcements of tariffs, given the results we had in Q1, we were debating whether we should take up full year guidance. Uh, but given that it's just the beginning of the year, and then the announcement of the tariffs, we felt prudent at this day to maintain our full year guidance.

Understood. So I know that you've also as part of that introduced a tariff task force internally. Our sourcing indicates that some items that you have could increase their costs by as much as 100%. Does that feel accurate to you?

Not entirely, only because if you think of our supply chain, yes, so first, we have got a task force. The task force is working 24/7. It's how we have managed other, uh, you know, previous crisis and we've actually, being a company has been around 170 years, we have navigated through them and emerged stronger post the crisis. Uh the task force is really looking at all options. They're looking at cost management options, they're looking at how we manage and talk to our different stakeholders, customers, our vendors who we have long tenure relationships and also looking at pricing options, you know, from that perspective. Uh, to your question about a diversified supply chain, uh, you know, we source from 28 different countries, uh, and not any country makes up more than 25% of, uh, you know, what we source from into the US. We source from 20 countries. We have the product already for spring and summer and that's why, you know, we were very clear about expectations for quarter two.

Harmeet, this is Nancy Tengler. I'm a native San Franciscan, so Levi holds a very special place in my heart, but I'm wondering if you anticipate any retaliatory demand issues from, from some of our trading partners.

Nancy, we haven't seen any retaliatory, you know, pushback from consumers. As a brand, we have been present internationally for over 80 years. Uh, we have deep connections with the consumers, you know, we're an American brand with a global presence and 60% of our business is overseas. Um, and so you know, as far as we are seeing international as an example was up 9% into 75% of the apparel market is outside the US and we are connecting really well with the consumers globally.

All right, Harmeet, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.

WPP acquires InfoSum to power WPP Open.
Handing data over, moving data, leakage of data: it’s not good for privacy.
Forget whether you own data or not, asking your clients to ‘please send me your data’ – it just has to stop.","So, a real, tangible point of difference between marketing’s monoliths is a tasty dish for the industry’s commentariat to feast on. Look closely and you’ll find the holdcos’ biggest such difference in an unlikely spot: how they source and share data.

In short, some want to own robust data sets that resolve into identity-matched profiles of real people. Some want to build platforms to connect others’ data sources as quickly and safely as possible.

British holdco WPP, firmly in the latter camp, solidified its position by acquiring fellow London-founded InfoSum last week. The latter is a specialist in data clean room technology – a category that Lauren Wetzel, chief executive of InfoSum, tells The Drum the company “created and defined” with its “different way of doing data collaboration,” which prioritizes data safety.

Reports of the price WPP paid for InfoSum have not been confirmed, but former owners, investment group Chrysalis, posted reports of $63m in cash gains on the day of the sale.

The move follows WPP’s acquisition of Stability AI, the generative AI developer of Stable Diffusion, last month and the gradual folding-in of agency T&Pm last year, all in service of a much-vaunted $300m investment in its AI platform WPP Open this year.

InfoSum will become a part of Choreograph, the global data company that itself sits within GroupM, WPP’s media investment business. It’s the final keystone in that approach to data that diverges markedly from WPP’s competitors, Evan Hanlon, global chief executive of Choreograph, tells The Drum. “Now, we have all the pieces.”

The war on identity: A primer

Many commentators have been quick to point out how unsurprising the move is: GroupM chief executive Brian Lesser spent four years at the helm of InfoSum from 2020 to 2024. And beyond any personal ties, Lesser has been loudly beating a drum for an approach to big data that he has called “a shift from ID to AI,” under which “we believe that data connectivity is more important than simply owning a database… No matter how many traditional IDs you own, it will never be enough.”

The line was a jab at WPP’s competitors, which are investing heavily in the ‘identity-based’ approach to big data that prizes owning vast supplies of data sources that can resolve the identities of internet users to deliver personalized messaging. WPP shares that final goal but not the method. Its divergent approach instead prizes connecting disparate data sources and providing an environment that is not reliant on any particular set of the ‘profiles’ that identity-based approaches yield.

Almost on cue after Lesser’s identity-bashing speech, WPP’s biggest competitor, Publicis Groupe (which had recently leapfrogged it to become the world’s biggest ad company), went public with its acquisition of data shop Lotame, adding 1.6bn profiles to its sack and doubling down, hard, on identity. Scott Hagedorn, chief solutions architect for the group, told The Drum at the time: “Without an identity footprint, marketers can’t really do modern marketing.”

He added: “The problem is, when you become dependent on syndicating identity, you’re going to get charged every time you use that identity. That’s why we’ve been able to make identity and AI work for our clients: because we’ve made investments to own it and not rent it.”

In the rarefied air of marketing’s holding company world, this is the equivalent of a flame war. On one side, WPP is rejecting identity as the center of any sensible data approach, while on the other, Publicis (alongside newly merged Omnicom and IPG with their equivalent to Epsilon, Omni) is insisting that identity is modern marketing’s very core.

“The pattern is clear,” says Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester: “Omnicom acquires IPG in part for Acxiom to power Omni. Publicis acquires Lotame to bolster CoreAI. WPP acquires InfoSum to power WPP Open. In the near future, clients will no longer buy the agency, but rather the agency’s algorithm for advertising, media and experience activation.”

‘Intelligence beyond identity’

Choreograph’s Hanlon acknowledges an element of “intellectual sparring” in the air as the two approaches butt heads. But InfoSum-bolstered WPP is doubly bullish on its ‘intelligence beyond identity’ strategy.

The argument is two-fold: that acquiring data to develop understandings of identity alone is insufficient for the marketing environment and that what WPP is building – capped off by the InfoSum acquisition – helps marketers plug the gaps of identity with whatever their most salient data sources are at the time.

First, the negative element. Identity alone, Hanlon says, is a “very good data set – but it’s not the only one and it’s less and less useable today,” with increases in privacy protection, cookie opt-outs and untrackable browsers. Worse, he says, identity alone is inherently backward-looking. “If you’re only focused on the data that you can acquire, you’re going to miss-serve your clients because you’re looking at a very narrow slice of the world – one that is frequently archaic, using antiquated technologies, that gives you a really great look back at what has happened but doesn’t give you a lot of predictive power about what is going to happen in the future.”

The answer, Hanlon says, is AI, data connectivity and building an environment to do that data connection quickly and securely – enter InfoSum. “Look at the challenge and the opportunity of what AI lets us do – which is to associate lots of different data domains, data types and data models for apples-to-apples comparisons in ways that we couldn’t before (fast and slow data; big and small data; panel and census data; US data and UK data), in ways that are privacy safe, leaving the data where it sits. It was clear to us that we needed a technology like InfoSum to help us move to the speed at the speed that we need to.”

Amid all the talk of identity, this reintroduces a pair of concepts, not long ago dominant, that are talked about less when providers are looking to amass as many identity-resolved ‘profiles’ of real people as possible: data privacy and safety. For InfoSum’s Wetzel, this is the true core of her company. “The mission we’ve been on is acknowledging and calling out the way data has been used to power, generically speaking, data-driven advertising. It has just never been the right method. Handing data over, moving data, leakage of data: it’s not good for privacy. It’s awful for security. And it needs to be rearchitected. Forget whether you own data or not, asking your clients to ‘please send me your data’ – it just has to stop. And being closed about the value has to stop.”

She adds: “It needs to be open and transparent. The tenets of privacy protection are critical because it’s just not going to go away. It doesn’t matter if there’s regulation or not. Consumers care. Brands take a long time to build trust with their consumer and they can lose it in a second. I find our agenda being warmly embraced by CMOs who just don’t want to take any of that risk on.”

As for Publicis’s comments about the inefficiencies of renting over owning data: “I would check the receipts,” says Wetzel. “[Publicis] is going to prove the value of acquiring Lotame and Epsilon and it absolutely is passing that charge back. It is packaging it with media and the data that it owns and probably some consulting services and a handful of other things, but it is absolutely passing that cost and pocketing the money for it”.

So, the respectful disagreement between the identity school and the intelligence school doesn’t look likely to end soon. And as Nicole Greene, vice-president and analyst specializing in AI at Gartner, tells The Drum, AI’s still-early-days spread into every corner of the marketing ecosystem will only intensify the great data debate: “AI requires quality data, so it’s no surprise that holding companies are racing to position themselves for the AI-enabled advertising future. The battle lines are drawn around privacy, security and the depth of consumer insights, with each company tooling up to meet the demands of an increasingly data-driven, privacy-centric advertising landscape.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/355641/wpp_infosum.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:28.886724

Top banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have watered down their own DEI programmes in response to the Trump administration’s pushback.","Barclays is scrapping diversity targets at its US business just months after the bank’s boss pledged its “enduring and unwavering” commitment to DEI policies.

The overhaul will see Barclays drop its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) quotas in the US after Donald Trump declared war on “woke” in corporate America.

C. S. Venkatakrishnan, Barclays’ chief executive who is also known as Venkat, said the move followed a review of its policies in the wake of Mr Trump’s electoral victory late last year.

The bank will retain its diversity targets in the UK and other markets.

A Barclays spokesman said: “We started reviewing our overall approach in late 2024 and that review is still underway. In the meantime, we have taken the decision to no longer have specific US representation ambitions.

“Our representation ambitions for the rest of the group will continue, and are being considered as part of the review.”

The changes will see Barclays scrap ambitions to have 33pc of its director and managing director roles held by women by the end of this year, as well as plans to increase the number of ethnic minority executives by 50pc.

In a memo seen by Bloomberg, Mr Venkatakrishnan said: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US.

“As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

Barclays’ decision comes just months after Mr Venkatakrishnan in February told reporters the British bank was committed to creating an “inclusive environment”.

Speaking on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call, the Barclays boss said: “If you want to get the very best people, by necessity, you get a very diverse workforce. We want to provide equality of opportunity, and we want to create that inclusive environment.”

The reversal follows the Trump administration’s far-reaching campaign against corporate DEI initiatives that has seen the US president ban all diversity programmes in the US federal government.

Top banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have watered down their own DEI programmes in response to the Trump administration’s pushback.

JP Morgan rebranded its own DEI initiatives under the name Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion (DOI) last month.

Major British firms including Deloitte have also scrapped their DEI programmes in the US while keeping them in place in Britain, in response to President Trump’s attacks.

At the end of 2023, 30pc of Barclays’ executives were women, while 5.1pc of its staff in Britain and 21pc of its employees in the US were from “under-represented minorities”, according to the bank’s most recent DEI report.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/04/08/TELEMMGLPICT000355798800_17441247866040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:07.007382

The FDA is reviewing a request for approval of FcRn blocker nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). J&J is late to the party, with argenx and UCB already selling rival FcRn blockers, but has bet big in the belief nipocalimab has advantages over the competition. Ongoing dosing with argenx’s Vyvgart and UCB’s Rystiggo is based on clinical evaluation. J&J has studied consistent dosing of nipocalimab.

The Big Pharma previously reported a 5.73-point reduction on a gMG symptom scale after 24 weeks of the open-label extension. The reduction hit 5.97 points at Week 48. Tuesday, J&J published the latest cut of data from the ongoing extension trial, reporting a reduction of 5.64 points after 60 weeks.

The average symptom score fell 6.01 points in people who switched to nipocalimab from placebo after the trial’s double-blind period. Forty-five percent of antibody-positive patients reduced or discontinued steroids. The mean dose of the steroid prednisone decreased from 23 mg to 10 mg a day.

If the FDA approves nipocalimab, the long-term data could form part of J&J’s pitch for the gMG market. The labels for argenx’s Vyvgart, in its intravenous and subcutaneous forms, state the safety of delivering ongoing doses less than 50 days apart hasn’t been established. The figure for UCB’s Rystiggo is 63 days.

J&J, which acquired nipocalimab in its $6.5 billion takeover of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, has made the case that its FcRn blocker should be safer than rival molecules because it is highly specific to the IgG binding site without overlap on the albumin binding site. Consistent nipocalimab dosing could support sustained disease control, strengthening J&J’s play for the gMG market and other indications.

However, the company will face a well-established rival in gMG. Argenx won approval in 2021 and later launched a subcutaneous version.

The McDonald’s McRig doesn’t drive itself, and it certainly doesn’t cook its own burgers.","Why was McDonald’s McRig Created?

The McRig was created with one goal in mind: to show up when people need it most. When disaster strikes and communities are left picking up the pieces, this fully equipped mobile kitchen rolls in, bringing hot meals and a sense of normalcy to those who need it. Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, or local events, the McRig is ready to lend a helping spatula.

The McDonald’s McRig is equipped with state-of-the-art kitchen facilities, allowing it to prepare and serve a wide range of McDonald's menu items. The truck is also designed to be self-sufficient, with its own power and water supply, allowing it to operate in areas with limited infrastructure.

How Does McDonald’s McRig Support Local Communities?

When deployed, the McRig is run by local franchisees in the impacted areas to provide immediate support after disasters. Each meal donation that the McRig offers underscores McDonald's commitment to supporting local communities.

One of its standout moments came in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in 2022. In collaboration with its local Florida franchisees, the McDonald’s McRig delivered 17,000 free hot meals to residents in Southwest Florida. Over four days, the McRig, provided freshly prepared grab-and-go meal delivery, including cheeseburgers, McNuggets, French fries, apple slices, and bottled water.

The McDonald’s McRig doesn’t drive itself, and it certainly doesn’t cook its own burgers. It’s powered by an incredible team of logistics pros, operations, and community members who ensure that everything runs smoothly.

The team is responsible for ensuring the McRig is always ready to deploy at a moment's notice. This includes regular maintenance, stocking the truck with necessary supplies, and coordinating with local authorities and organizations.

The operations team oversees the actual deployment, ensuring the McRig is set up and functioning efficiently at the disaster site.

Community members play a crucial part in identifying areas where the McRig's support is needed most. They work closely with non-profit organizations and government agencies to ensure the McRig's efforts are aligned with the needs of the affected population. This collaborative approach ensures that the McRig can provide the most support possible.

The McRig is a reminder that in tough times a warm meal can make all the difference and embodies our commitment to leaving a positive impact on the communities we serve.",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:08.110183

The Tech in the UK 2024 report from Barclays Eagle Labs shows where high-growth businesses (such as scaleups and academic spinouts) are concentrated outside London, highlighting how these are contributing to their local economy. It uses Gross Value Added (GVA) as a comparable measure of the economic contribution of businesses to these regions.

The report shows that local areas with 100+ high-growth companies boast an average Gross Value Added (GVA) per business of £294k, compared to just £27.5k for those with less than 100. Manchester benefits the most from its businesses, which contributed £30bn to the area in 2022.

Edinburgh is home to 450+ high-growth tech companies, where Scottish Enterprise plays a key role in commercialising research for carve outs. 198 deals were signed here between 2020-24.

Bristol also benefits from efforts between universities, such as Brunel Centre, a joint data hub between the University of Bath and UWE. Last year investment was up 10% at £167m, with Bristol’s wider deeptech cluster “Silicon Gorge” now spanning Bristol, Gloucester and Swindon.

However, boosting local economies isn’t simply down to higher numbers. Cambridge and Leeds are each home to 280 high-growth companies – in Cambridge, whilst every £1 spent by businesses contributed to £8 of economic impact, businesses in Leeds contributed quadruple the impact due to its broader base of industries.

Investment in Cambridge last year passed half a billion, whilst the wider Yorkshire & Humber region (with Leeds) received just £179m. Continuing to invest in diverse economic hubs across the North of England can be seen as a priority on this basis.

Access to finance remains key for these high growth businesses across the UK, although almost 7 in 10 (68%) report they are aware of all the financing options relevant to them.

Sam's Club and Costco, known for their low prices and bulk products, usually limit their hours or close completely during holidays like this.
Sam's Club and Costco: What Will They Do?
With Sam's Club and Costco closing on Easter Sunday, consumers who need to make quick purchases might turn to Albertsons.
Sam's Club and Costco specialize in wholesale sales, but consumers can't always wait for their stores to open after Easter Sunday.","With Easter just around the corner, Albertsons has made a strategic decision that could change the market dynamics. The supermarket chain has announced that its stores, including brands like Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Tom Thumb, and ACME, will be open on Easter Sunday, April 20, 2025. This move is a blow to its competitors, like Sam's Club and Costco, which usually close on holidays.

A Key Move to Attract Customers

Easter Sunday is a crucial date for shopping, especially for those who need fresh products and essential items for family celebrations. While many large chains close their doors, Albertsons has decided to open to offer more convenience to consumers. This move aims to attract those who need to make last-minute purchases.

Albertsons stands out for its strategy of opening on key holidays, which puts it in an advantageous position against its competitors. Sam's Club and Costco, known for their low prices and bulk products, usually limit their hours or close completely during holidays like this. This can cause frustration among consumers who rely on these stores at critical times.

Albertsons: Flexible Hours Depending on Location

Although most Albertsons stores will be open, the company has warned that hours may vary depending on the location. Customers will need to check their local store hours, as these may be adjusted according to local regulations or demand in each area. This flexibility is key to ensuring that consumers can access products without complications.

Opening on Easter Sunday also shows Albertsons's commitment to customer convenience. In an increasingly competitive market, where online shopping is rapidly growing, offering physical shopping options is an advantage that not many competitors can offer on holidays.

Sam's Club and Costco: What Will They Do?

Albertsons's announcement comes at a key moment. With Sam's Club and Costco closing on Easter Sunday, consumers who need to make quick purchases might turn to Albertsons. Both competitors, despite offering attractive prices, have a policy of closing on these days. This behavior could put Albertsons in a dominant position.

Sam's Club and Costco specialize in wholesale sales, but consumers can't always wait for their stores to open after Easter Sunday. Therefore, Albertsons's decision to keep its doors open represents a clear advantage over these retail giants.

Convenience as a Key Factor

Convenience is a crucial factor in shopping. On dates like Easter Sunday, consumers are not only looking for low prices but also the ability to access fresh and essential products. Albertsons's opening during this holiday allows them to gain the preference of those who need to shop without complications.

This approach also reinforces Albertsons's image as an accessible supermarket chain, willing to adapt to consumer needs. At a time when shopping habits are changing, decisions like this could be key.

Long-Term Impact for Albertsons

Albertsons's move has a potential long-term impact. Opening on holidays can result in an increase in sales, which in turn strengthens the relationship with consumers. People who benefit from this flexible schedule might feel more inclined to choose Albertsons for future purchases.

Moreover, this opening strategy can be an example for other supermarket chains that traditionally choose to close on important holidays. If Albertsons achieves good results with this measure, it is likely that other brands will be motivated to follow their example.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/exterior-albertsons-tienda_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:02.329828

While serving 18 million customers across 24 markets in Asia and Africa, a leading APAC insurer identified an opportunity to enhance efficiency by integrating and automating its systems. However, doing so would require modernizing the organization’s Singaporean operations.

The insurer’s legacy business process management system forced employees to navigate multiple applications for essential tasks. This included viewing allocated tasks, accessing medical and non-medical documents in content manager, and reviewing underwriting decisions in their existing tool. In addition, users had to track case statuses and histories, including audit trails, in a separate policy administration system. The company envisioned a one-stop solution to simplify key activities like risk assessment, policy issuance, and claims management and eliminate inefficiencies.

To realize this vision, the insurer partnered with Capgemini, leveraging its extensive experience in similar transformations and its technical expertise to deliver a seamless solution.

Building a new workflow application

Capgemini and the insurer collaborated through a series of workshops spread out over three months which provided an opportunity to analyze key processes, such as new business, policy servicing, and claims, and identify where automation could most effectively support additional efficiency.

The solution involved developing a low-code/no-code cloud-based workflow application to streamline operations and reduce reliance on legacy systems. Leveraging its partnership with IBM, Capgemini implemented a BPM workflow with a customized UX/UI aligned to the insurer’s enterprise architecture. A laser focus on change management ensured a smooth transition, while a flowchart-style rules engine and automation tools enhanced decision-making and operational efficiency overall.

Scalable efficiency

The scalable platform, with key features like case segregation based on underwriting (UW) and straight-through processing (STP) decisions, and automatic allocation to user groups based on customer segments, UW decisions, and plan types, were developed during this transformation. This has significantly reduced policy issuance timelines. A unified dashboard set up, now consolidates all relevant information, ensuring a seamless user experience and supporting further digital transformation.

To significantly reduce reliance on multiple applications and cutting turnaround times, the system also introduced the auto distribution feature, which enabled load balancing while accounting for employees’ availability and defined case parameters. This allows the processing of hundreds of policies daily.

The transformation enabled a 60% increase in end-to-end straight-through processing for new business by integrating multi-channel application submissions, automated data extraction, classification, and a unified UW workbench. For policy servicing, it automated simple transactions, eliminated back-office dependencies, updated core systems for renewals, and streamlined standard non-financial services.

Additionally, claims operations benefited from the introduction of STP with electronic submissions, rule-based assignments, and skill-based workflows. This enabled a data-driven and automated workflow approach, now improving processes across new business, policy servicing, and claims, improving efficiency and operational outcomes.

Capgemini continues to maintain the application, with plans to scale the transformation further. As a next step, the insurer is set to roll out these solutions in other Asian regions, extending the benefits of the initiative. As the partnership evolves, Capgemini remains committed to supporting the insurer’s efforts to optimize services and claims processes.",https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Leading-APAC-insurer-client-story-web-preview-image.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 14:10:55.603182

Empirical studies consistently reveal a strong link between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.

Eli Lilly, uh, talking about 27 billion for four manufacturing, uh, uh, buildouts in the in the coming years.
We do know that any additional manufacturing like, uh, that already exists here, any capacity that already exists here is really going to benefit getting, you know, that windfall from anyone scrambling to to get their, uh, manufacturing going.","Shares of Walgreens sticking higher this morning after the company reported an earnings beat for the second quarter, as it prepares to go private. Walgreens was the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, but has recovered some ground in 2025. Here with more on everything happening around Walgreens Boots Alliance, we've got Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Where do you want to start on, because we've got the earnings, we got the company going private, there's a lot swirling.

Yeah, I know. It's a lot. I'll start with the company going private because that actually shifts how we're gonna be covering earnings, of course, once they go private, but also for right now they've completely cut us off. No, I'm kidding. They don't have an earnings call today. So I don't have additional context for you other than what the numbers say, and that's something, um, that we're gonna have to deal with moving forward. They've also pulled 2025 guidance, and that has not seemed to impact the stock negatively, as you noted it is up today. But let's take a look at the numbers and what they said, beat on the revenue, expected 38, beat with 36 38.6 billion. And then not just did earnings per share at 63 cents rather than 53. Now, wanna look at some of the other numbers, cuz we know that they're still in a cost management mode. So while they have reduced the loss since the quarter last year, uh, CEO Tim Wentworth sent a statement that the strategy to reduce cost is still in play and will take some time and so that's what we're looking at. Uh, loss per share, uh, in total $3.30 versus Q2 of 2024, which was $6.85. So that's something to keep in mind. Meanwhile, um, looking at the decrease, um, in the revenue this year had a little bit to do with tax rate front-end slow stores, slow sales at front of store, but then also, uh, a hit through legal settlements. So 969 million of legal payments, and that is from an old case with Everlywell, a COVID testing company that they had, uh, some disagreements with on how they partnered. And then an and then opioid related settlements still weighing on the company. So that's something to keep an eye on as they continue their trajectory into privatization.

It's, I can't think of a better time to have the excuse of privatization to be able to cut your forward guidance that really works out for Walgreens in this moment. I I do wanna get your take on Julian and another story in your beat that we are monitoring, which is CVS making some leadership changes this morning. What can you tell us?

Yeah. So that's an interesting one, because, um, going from one company to the other, CVS the last one standing in this really large retail drug space, um, the last ryan and having to deal with its own moves. We know that they had to shift through their CEOs, they had a shake up there now, David Joyner is CEO. And so now they're bringing in Brian Newman as the new CFO replacing, uh, Tom Cowey. And so Brian has been at UPS and other retail companies. So that's an interesting fit there, even though we know CVS has done a lot more in the health delivery space. They have a CFO in the retail space there. And then a new executive vice president and Chief Medical Officer, Amy Compton Phillips. Uh, looks like she's gonna be taking over that role from uh, Sricharu who's also taking on who also has another role as, uh, president of healthcare delivery. So a little shift there. So interesting moves right now, as we know the company is, uh, you know, dealing with some of the same pressures that Walgreens was facing in terms of, you know, weakness in front of store sales and just all the changes that are coming down the pike with prescriptions, PBMs, etcetera. So should be interesting to see how this pans out.

You know, investors have heard us talk a lot about healthcare at the start of this year and and and here from fact set is perhaps one of the most important markers of why. Healthcare sector expected to report the highest year of year earnings growth rate of all 11 sectors at 35.8%. You think about the industry and the sector right now, US drug manufacturers, they're planning a lot of shifts right now too. How are they planning for shifts under President Trump's tariffs as well though that are moving for?

We saw this before the tariffs were even announced. We have major companies like Johnson and Johnson, Eli Lilly and Merck announcing multi-billion dollar projects for shifting manufacturing to the US. You can see on your screen the numbers there, Johnson and Johnson with that 55 billion. Eli Lilly, uh, talking about 27 billion for four manufacturing, uh, uh, buildouts in the in the coming years. All of this is a long-term process though. And so in the meantime, in the interim, while these tariffs start to take place, we know that the manufacturing of drugs wasn't heavily hit by tariffs, but there are going to be announcements of, uh, terrorists that do affect pharma and so that's what they're expecting. And so in that interim, these companies have sort of ahead of the curve, tried to make announcements and and curry favor with the administration. We do know that any additional manufacturing like, uh, that already exists here, any capacity that already exists here is really going to benefit getting, you know, that windfall from anyone scrambling to to get their, uh, manufacturing going. It's also interesting to note that, uh, it is very company specific, um, and also pharma subsector specific, because medical devices are still going to be impacted by those tariffs, and that's an a subsector that is trying to work with the administration to come out of impact as well.

Health care giant Johnson & Johnson is one of the most well-known and respected brands, and its response to the 1982 tampering of Tylenol bottles that killed seven people is held up in business schools as a model.

But in “No More Tears: The Dark Secrets of Johnson & Johnson,” veteran reporter Gardiner Harris uses his investigative skills to scrutinize the legacy of the company, as well as that of federal regulators. What he unveils is a damning portrait.

It’s a story that Harris writes “has been hiding in plain sight for a very long time,” but his comprehensively reported and researched book goes much further.

Harris takes a deeper dive in looking at Johnson & Johnson’s history, including the story behind the litigation against the company that it settled for billions of dollars over its baby powder containing talc powder.

He details a litany of controversies involving the company ranging from the effects of its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal to the company’s role in the nation’s opioid crisis.

But Harris doesn’t spare others from scrutiny or criticism with his book. Namely, he focuses on what he calls the false mythology of the Food and Drug Administration, detailing times when the agency fell short of protecting consumers.

He also trains his eye on the American media itself, noting ways that reporters at times portrayed the FDA’s actions against drugmakers as tougher than they really were.

The use of balloons makes the investigational devices potential competitors to J&J products such as Shockwave C2.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson said Monday it has enrolled the first patient in a pivotal study of a device for clearing “difficult-to-cross” coronary arteries.

Like other products made by J&J’s Shockwave Medical, the Javelin intravascular lithotripsy catheter uses sound pressure waves to break up calcium deposits that are blocking blood flow.

The device is differentiated from other Shockwave products, and rival catheters from Abbott and Boston Scientific, because it emits waves from its tip. Other devices send waves from a balloon catheter that must cross the blocked part of the artery to be effective.

Dive Insight:

Shockwave revealed the Javelin device at an investor event in October 2023, months before accepting a $13.1 billion buyout bid from J&J. The company developed Javelin after recognizing that balloon-based catheters are unable to pass through some vessels. If physicians cannot get a balloon across a vessel, they cannot use Shockwave’s other IVL devices to remove calcium deposits.

By miniaturizing its IVL technology, Shockwave developed a catheter capable of emitting waves from its tip. Rather than crossing the artery and then emitting waves from the balloon, the device sends out IVL pulses from the tip to clear deposits and allow the catheter to advance along the vessel.

The Food and Drug Administration cleared a Javelin device for use in peripheral vessels last year, opening up more of the below-the-knee market. The new study will enroll up to 158 patients across around 35 sites in the U.S. and U.K. to generate data to unlock more of the coronary market.

J&J’s investment in Javelin technology could provide a point of difference versus companies that are mounting challenges for the IVL market. Boston Scientific recently entered the space by agreeing to pay $443 million upfront for Bolt Medical. Abbott acquired an IVL program in 2023 as part of its $890 million takeover of Cardiovascular Systems and received approval to start a trial in the U.S. last month.

Abbott’s device uses a balloon to widen parts of the arteries that are narrowed by calcium. Similarly, Bolt was working on a balloon catheter when it accepted Boston Scientific’s offer. The use of balloons makes the investigational devices potential competitors to J&J products such as Shockwave C2.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/MaOYX5e0YyLMdtsLierlo-ryQchxIJMACDO_iSEmRhg/g:nowe:0:0/c:1732:978/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzczMjYxMzY1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:50.237552

The poll of 3,023 workers across the U.S. focused on perks and benefits that drive employee retention. While competitive pay continues to draw headlines, the results show that generous leave policies, health care offerings and lifestyle benefits are equally — and sometimes more — important in keeping employees engaged.

In New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson secured the top spot for its robust family support offerings. The company provides 18–20 weeks of paid maternity leave (based on tenure), 12 weeks for all new parents, and up to $20,000 per child for adoption or surrogacy. Other benefits include on-site fitness centers, global mental health support and dual-career assistance — all helping it stand out among working parents and employees at every life stage.

Nationally, the top five employers based on perks and benefits were:

Google (California)

Famous for its over-the-top workplace culture, Google still offers perks like free gourmet meals, nap pods, laundry services and on-site gyms. More importantly, it provides generous family leave, fertility assistance and premium health benefits. While some of the flashier perks have been scaled back in recent years, the company continues to lead in employee experience.

The Coca-Cola Co. (Georgia)

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola offers a rare combination of a traditional pension plan with a 401(k) match, along with solid health insurance, tuition reimbursement and adoption support. Its “Total Rewards” approach ensures that both financial and personal well-being are covered.

Ben & Jerry’s (Vermont)

In South Burlington, Ben & Jerry’s blends social values with standout perks: six months of paid parental leave, livable wages and a famously sweet benefit — three free pints of ice cream a day. The company’s relaxed culture and emphasis on personal freedom make it a favorite in Vermont.

Hawaiian Airlines (Hawaii)

As Hawaii’s largest airline, Hawaiian Airlines gives employees — and their families — unlimited standby flights, 20 guest passes a year, and profit-sharing bonuses. The company’s culture of hospitality extends to its internal team, with a focus on loyalty and long-term support.

Nike (Oregon)

Nike emphasizes work-life balance through generous PTO, flexible schedules, and sabbaticals for long-tenured employees. Wellness programs, tuition reimbursement and career advancement paths reinforce its commitment to employee growth. Perks also include discounts on Nike and Converse gear, early product drops, and daycare options at some locations.

“These findings show that salary alone doesn’t seal the deal,” said Raymond Lee, president of Careerminds. “Companies that invest in holistic employee experiences — from mental health to long-term financial planning — are building the workplaces where people want to stay and grow.”",https://images.roi-nj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/leadership_business_goals_challenges_success.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:54.195144

As Singapore gears up to welcome 18.5 million visitors in 2025—nearing pre-pandemic levels—brands are intensifying efforts to capture peak travel demand with more strategic and targeted offers.

“Managing seasonality in travel and leisure requires some strategic marketing, including things like personalised offers, leveraging local events and dynamic pricing,” said Adam Furness, Managing Director for Asia Pacific at impact.com.

Furness noted that combining flights, hotels, and services into dynamic bundles drives higher conversions during peak periods. “It’s all about maximising conversions during the peak season, collaborating with airlines, hotels, travel agencies to offer exclusive time-sensitive deals also drives urgency and sales,” he said.

“Partnerships with tourism boards, festival organizers, local government or cultural institutions can enhance destination appeal and encourage repeat visits,” he added.

“We [also] offer lounge access at discounted rates whenever a customer purchases a travel e-sim with JetPac,” said Jun Kai, Commercial Lead at JetPac. “We also offer free lounge access if your flight is ever delayed.”

Furness stressed that affiliate and influencer marketing are critical channels during high-traffic seasons. “By partnering with travel-focused content creators and affiliates… brands can stay top of mind and drive repeat bookings through trusted recommendations,” he said.

A multi-pronged brand refresh is a core part of this.","After a streak of dull sales, hair care brand Olaplex is hoping an effort to go back to the roots—literally—will help revitalize it.

Olaplex was founded in 2014, starting in the professional channel at salons before expanding into retail. The company launched on DTC and into specialty retailers like Sephora in 2018, and went public and expanded into Ulta stores in 2021.

The brand has had its struggles since going public, including a since-denied class action lawsuit and slipping sales, particularly in the professional channel. Former Supergoop CEO Amanda Baldwin took over as chief exec in December 2023 to begin a turnaround. In its most recent earnings reported in March, net sales dropped 9.8%, with professional sales down 27.1%, though specialty retail rose 5.7%. On that earnings call, Baldwin introduced the brand’s new “Bonds and Beyond strategic vision,” comprising three pillars: shifting its products and messaging beyond treating damage to “foundational hair health,” fostering its professional business, and creating an “emotional connection” with consumers.

A multi-pronged brand refresh is a core part of this. While Olaplex’s products were designed and marketed to treat damage from hair coloring, CMO Katie Gohman told Retail Brew, lately the company has found that “the visual identity wasn’t really representing everything that the brand could do for both stylists as well as consumers.”

“A great brand has an emotional territory in a world that consumers aspire to be a part of,” Gohman said.

Split ends: This refresh has been in the works for about a year, Gohman said. She joined Olaplex last July, after serving as CMO at Marc Jacobs (her retail résumé also includes Ralph Lauren, Coach, and L’Oréal), and began building out its marketing team, focused on digital, media, and analytics, she said. The company brought on Andrew Reuben, another Ralph Lauren alum, as VP of global digital marketing and media in January, with other recent hires including a director of global digital marketing and media and a digital designer of global creative, per LinkedIn.

“How do you then bring the brand to life and to market? That was a muscle that hadn’t really been built here,” Gohman said.

With the refresh, Olaplex has changed “almost all consumer-facing communication touch points,” she said. That includes a new visual identity with an updated logo, a new website unveiled in February (with user experience and interface redone), and a relaunched social presence.

It has also rolled out updated in-store merchandising with both retail and professional partners, as Gohman said Olaplex had received feedback that its product line was “extremely confusing and people didn’t understand how to shop it.” Now, at retail partners, the first shelf highlights the focus on foundational hair health including its latest product innovation N°0.5 Scalp Longevity Treatment. The next shelves zero in on the wash routine—shampoo, conditioner, and masks—followed by a shelf for styling products like hair oil.

“We worked on what we call internally a product architecture but really is, ‘How does the consumer navigate the line?’ she said. “It was all about really making that journey easier for the consumer.”

Framing the face: That all culminated in a brand campaign released last week featuring the tagline “Designed to Defy,” with a spot featuring actress Nicola Coughlan, fashion designer and former J. Crew president and creative director Jenna Lyons, and Olympic sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone alongside Olaplex pro stylists emphasizing the “confidence” and “endless possibilities” a good hair day presents. This represents a new effort to center stylists in its communications, Gohman said, noting they “help tell our story the best.”

It’s also extending this campaign into an IRL experience—an element younger generations of consumers “demands,” Gohman said—which has come in the form of the Olaplex Bond House in New York City on April 4, a series of events for consumers including a digital hair analysis scan.

With the campaign, beyond just sales, KPIs Gohman is zeroing in on include earned media value (how much people are talking about the brand in media), search interest, and—longer term—brand health (measuring perception and awareness), to ensure the brand is “making progress on our values and on the emotional territory in the spaces that we want to grow.”

The Designed to Defy campaign is a step in creating that emotional connection Baldwin had referenced, Gohman said. The company learned that connection was lacking through field research, asking consumers questions like “What does the brand make you feel?” and recognizing those scores came up short, though she said there was no negative feedback about the products’ efficacy.

“As a marketer and even just a consumer in general, I think you know the brands that you feel something when you see their work or you aspire to be a part of that world, and those that you don’t,” she said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/18a37dc42391399c35275ce9a8e5f8b798c4bc25-6289x6590.jpg?rect=0,1644,6289,3302&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-08 12:25:00.064026

The company expects its gross margin to expand by 100 basis points (bps), reaching approximately 61.6 per cent, up from a base of 60.6 per cent. The adjusted EBIT margin is projected to rise to between 11.4 and 11.6 per cent YoY, revised upward from the original guidance of 10.9 to 11.1 per cent, which was based on a 10.2 per cent base.

Levi Strauss & Co expects FY25 organic net revenue growth of 3.5–4.5 per cent, with gross margin projected at 61.6 per cent and adjusted EBIT margin at 11.4–11.6 per cent.

The adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) is projected between $1.20 and $1.25, including an estimated $0.20 impact from foreign exchange (FX) and a higher tax rate. The updated outlook excludes any potential impact from the recently announced tariffs, Levi Strauss said in a press release.

In the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, the company generated revenue of $1.5 billion, marking a 3 per cent increase on a reported basis and 9 per cent growth on an organic basis compared to Q1 2024.

The Levi’s brand was up 8 per cent globally on an organic basis. The gross margin increased 330 bps to 62.1 per cent from 58.8 per cent in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favourable channel and brand mix.

Region-wise, Americas net revenues increased 6 per cent on a reported basis and 11 per cent on an organic basis. Within the Americas, the US grew 8 per cent on an organic basis. In Europe, net revenues decreased 5 per cent on a reported basis and increased 3 per cent on an organic basis.

Net revenues from e-commerce grew 13 per cent on a reported basis and 16 per cent on an organic basis. DTC comprised 52 per cent of total net revenues in the first quarter. Wholesale net revenues decreased 3 per cent on a reported basis and increased 5 per cent on an organic basis.

The operating margin of the company in Q1 2025 was 12.5 per cent compared to 0.04 per cent in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 bps to 13.4 per cent from 9.4 per cent last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7 per cent to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7 per cent compared to 49.4 per cent last year.

The company’s net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024.

Balance Sheet Review as of March 2, 2025

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Read it and other articles from this issue in our March/April digital edition.

Wastewater management is a critical yet complex challenge for pet food processors. High organic loads, fats and cleaning chemicals create a difficult-to-treat wastewater stream, requiring a combination of physical and biological processes. At the same time, regulatory pressures continue to evolve, increasing compliance costs and adding another layer of complexity to wastewater treatment strategies.

As sustainability goals take center stage, manufacturers are turning to advanced treatment technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs and minimize their environmental impact. From dissolved air flotation (DAF) systems to digital monitoring tools and water reuse strategies, processors are optimizing wastewater treatment to meet both operational and regulatory demands.

Common challenges

“Pet food processing facilities often encounter a range of wastewater treatment challenges, including proposed regulations mandating nutrient reduction or removal, surcharges that can reduce profitability, and escalating costs for labor, chemicals, as well as energy,” explained Chris Knodel, professional engineer, industrial wastewater manager, Burns & McDonnell, Kansas City, Mo. “Additional hurdles include fluctuating wastewater flows from cleaning cycles, high pollutant concentrations, and the limitations of aging infrastructure.”

Beyond regulatory and infrastructure challenges, operational inefficiencies further complicate wastewater management. These inefficiencies increase wastewater volumes, drive up treatment costs and create additional compliance hurdles. Identifying and addressing them is essential for improving wastewater management and sustainability.

“Common wastewater challenges often stem from improper management of plant-level issues,” said Kunal Mehta of Ecolab.

“Common wastewater challenges often stem from improper management of plant-level issues,” said Kunal Mehta, senior global account manager, enterprise solutions, Ecolab, Saint Paul, Minn. “Valve failure, uncontrolled product losses and excessive water use can all lead to compounding wastewater problems downstream. For example, let’s say the protocol for handling spilled product within a facility is to wash it down the drain. This increases the amount of chemistry required to treat wastewater and risks increasing transportation costs (and emissions) related to transporting effluent and byproducts. In this way, one cleaning and sanitation protocol can directly affect a number of wastewater and other sustainability priorities.”

In addition to these operational inefficiencies, the composition of wastewater itself presents a significant challenge. Pet food processing generates a complex wastewater stream that contains high levels of organic matter, including fats, oils and greases (FOGs), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These pollutants require specialized treatment before the wastewater can be safely discharged or reused.

“The biggest challenge is rendering and mixing, as well as using other organic ingredients to produce a finished product in pet food facilities similar to other food processing plants,” said John Richert, industrial sales manager, JWC Environmental, Santa Ana, Calif. “This generates a complex wastewater stream high in TSS, BOD/COD, FOGs, ammonia, and other chemical byproducts that must be treated before they can be sent to a municipal system or released to a surface water source.”

“The biggest challenge is rendering and mixing, as well as using other organic ingredients to produce a finished product in pet food facilities similar to other food processing plants,” said John Richert of JWC Environmental.

Fluctuating wastewater volumes introduce additional challenges to treatment efforts. Cleaning cycles and production variability can create inconsistent flow rates, making it difficult for treatment systems to operate efficiently. Many facilities are also relying on aging wastewater infrastructure that was designed for lower production capacities, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased compliance challenges.

“Plant production demands are very dynamic in the pet food industry, so robust and agile systems must be in place throughout the operation to minimize disruption,” said Eric Bradley, business development director, Hawkins, Inc., Roseville, Minn. “Wastewater infrastructure and equipment are often designed for a different operational pace from five or more years ago. Capital projects are usually slower than a current problem demands and more costly than the business desires.”

Effective treatment solutions

To address these challenges, pet food processors are implementing a range of wastewater treatment technologies designed to improve efficiency and maintain compliance.

“Flow equalization helps regulate fluctuating wastewater volumes, while screening efficiently removes large particles,” Knodel said. “Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is highly effective at eliminating oils and suspended solids. Advanced biological treatment systems, such as membrane bioreactors (MBR), moving bed bioreactors (MBBR) and sequencing batch reactors (SBR), provide efficient nutrient removal. Additionally, dewatering equipment minimizes sludge volume and hauling expenses, while asset management and capital planning strategies enable facilities to budget for component replacements and upgrades effectively.”

A key component of these treatment strategies is the use of Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems, which help remove FOGs and other suspended solids from wastewater streams.

“Wastewater containing very high levels of FOGs can be pretreated with a grease trap to remove free-floating grease. After one (or both) of these pre-treatment methods, the waste stream is sent to a DAF system for further treatment,” explained John O’Hehir, regional sales manager, Kemco Systems, Clearwater, Fla. “Kemco’s DAF is designed to give the maximum operator flexibility and maximum removal of oils, greases, skimmings and solids. Kemco’s DAF technology offers a centrifugal DAF pump. The multi-phase air saturation pump provides maximum air flotation with minimum maintenance cost and upkeep. The Kemco DAF system is available with chemical coagulant/flocculant mix systems designed to optimize the effectiveness of treatment chemicals.”

In addition to physical and biological treatment, digital monitoring tools are playing an increasing role in wastewater management.

“In the area of cleaning and sanitation, digital monitoring products can help facilities optimize the amount of chemistry they’re using to clean and sanitize core equipment,” Mehta said. “Among other things, this optimization directly impacts the quality of wastewater, which can help streamline the facility’s water management strategy and keep them compliant.”

Sustainability benefits

Effective wastewater treatment not only ensures regulatory compliance but also supports broader sustainability initiatives.

“Wastewater treatment solutions help minimize water usage, reduce nutrient discharges to the environment, and support resource recovery by capturing valuable byproducts such as oils, biogas and reusable water,” Knodel said. “Additionally, advanced technologies and automation systems lower power consumption, further bolstering sustainability initiatives.”

Many processors are implementing wastewater treatment strategies that align with their sustainability objectives. Some focus on meeting discharge requirements, while others invest in water reuse technologies to maximize efficiency.

“Sustainability can be measured in varying ways,” O’Hehir said. “For some processes, the ability to achieve local publicly owned treatment works (POTW) discharge limitations utilizing DAF or ceramic membrane filtration (CMF) technologies allows the processor to provide an acceptable effluent. For other processors where reuse is a goal, the CMF/RO combination removes FOGs, suspended solids, viruses and bacteria, microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and colors and odors. Because this combination of systems relies on physical processes, it can reduce facilities’ chemical costs. Coupled with thermal stability lessening the demand on boilers and reducing natural gas consumption, the CMF/RO combined system is both an economical and environmentally friendly solution for pet food processing wastewater by recycling both water and energy.”

Advanced digital monitoring solutions are also playing a role in sustainability efforts by improving visibility into water management performance. By tracking key metrics in real time, processors can proactively address wastewater issues and optimize cleaning and sanitation practices.

“Ecolab’s 3D TRASAR Technology for CIP (3DT CIP) helps pet food processors achieve sustainability goals while simultaneously supporting better efficiency,” Mehta said. “By arming facility leadership with better visibility into core cleaning and sanitation and water use metrics, 3DT CIP enables them to respond to potential wastewater issues before they become unmanageable.”

Reducing and reusing

As water costs rise and environmental regulations tighten, pet food processors are looking for ways to minimize wastewater and maximize water reuse. Reducing overall water consumption not only helps control operating expenses but also aligns with sustainability goals and regulatory expectations.

“Pet food processors can take several practical steps to reduce wastewater volume and improve water reuse,” Knodel said. “These include making operational changes to cleaning processes, exploring water reuse opportunities such as irrigation, boiler feed and cooling towers, as well as adopting new technologies like reverse osmosis, evaporation and crystallization. These measures can significantly lower the overall water footprint of pet food processing facilities.”

Identifying the right water reuse opportunities starts with evaluating each stage of processing. Understanding where water can be repurposed within the facility helps processors optimize usage while ensuring compliance with quality and safety standards.

“The challenges presented with reusing water are typically determined by where in the overall process reuse of water would be acceptable,” O’Hehir said. “As pet food processors evaluate the overall use of water and generation of wastewater within each stage of processing, they can identify opportunities for internal reuse within the same stage if the water cannot be reused further downstream.”

Reducing wastewater at the source is just as important as finding ways to reuse it. By preventing unnecessary contaminants from entering the wastewater system, pet food processors can lower treatment costs and improve overall efficiency.

“Three contaminants are universally present in the pet food industry and are the primary drivers of cost to treat: fats, oils, and grease (FOG), total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),” Bradley said. “Additional contaminants, such as phosphorus, chlorides, selenium and bacteria load, may also be relevant depending on the site and discharge parameters. Processors should take a fresh look at their systems to find ways to reduce these contaminants before they enter the wastewater stream.

“Reclaim water wherever possible to minimize water volume purchased and wastewater treated,” he added. “Water only needs to be as clean as the use application requires. There may be locations in a plant where one-use water may be fit for a second use, or treated wastewater can be used instead of ‘new’ water.”

Innovations and advancements

As wastewater regulations evolve, pet food processors are turning to automation, digital monitoring and advanced treatment technologies to stay ahead. Investing in these innovations will help optimize efficiency, enhance sustainability, and ensure compliance with stricter environmental standards.

“Innovations and advancements shaping the future of wastewater treatment in the pet food industry include the development of new, cost-competitive technologies for nutrient removal and water reuse, increasing opportunities for resource recovery and emerging incentives to adopt sustainable practices,” Knodel said. “Additional collaborative efforts with stakeholders are also paving the way for more integrated and efficient wastewater management solutions.”

With evolving regulations and increasing environmental concerns, wastewater treatment in the pet food industry will continue to evolve. As compliance standards become more stringent, processors will need to adopt new technologies to meet discharge requirements while maintaining operational efficiency.

“The regulatory landscape drives innovation in this market, and right now there’s a focus on de-nitrification and phosphorus removal,” Richert said. “This will require technologies that are not necessarily new but are new to the industry. Besides these, there will be more demand for further chemical removal associated with pharmaceuticals, for example.”

The next phase of wastewater treatment will focus on solutions that are more efficient, adaptable, and responsive to regulatory and economic pressures. Processors that stay informed about industry advancements and build strong partnerships with suppliers will be best positioned to navigate these changes.

“For the next five years, the demands of the pet food industry will drive focus to a few key factors in wastewater treatment chemistry: impact, versatility and safety,” Bradley said. “The most useful advancements will accomplish more with less and respond quickly to operational, regulatory and economic dynamics. To maximize the value of suppliers supporting an operation, develop a deeper compliance partnership with each key supplier to a wastewater plant.”",https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/ext/resources/Articles/2025/04April/040825_Wastewater-treatment_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1744113770&width=1200,N,,2025-04-08 13:10:26.326220

Figures from information provider Dealogic suggest that investment banking fees earned globally by UBS have fallen 23% in year-to-date 2025 versus the same period of 2024. At Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, they're up 5% and 6% respectively over the same period.

UBS's investment banking performance wouldn't look great in any circumstance, but it looks even worse in the context of the Credit Suisse acquisition, which reportedly resulted in the addition of 200 ""senior dealmakers."" The new bankers don't appear to have made much difference, yet.

UBS's poor banking performance comes as investment banking activity falters in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Even before the tariffs were imposed, Dealogic says investment banking fee revenues fell 3% year-on-year globally in the first quarter, with the biggest drops in Europe and Latin America (-15% and -21% respectively), and increases in North America and South East Asia (up 2% and 12%).

Job cuts are likely to ensue. UBS isn't commenting, but as we reported first last week, the Swiss bank is planning a new round of cuts later this month. Insiders at UBS, told Bloomberg that lists are already being drawn up of whom to let go. Insiders tells us they're based on recent performance appraisals, in which people were marked down unusually harshly. There are claims that ex-Credit Suisse people seemed to come off worse.

As revenues stagnate, though, the hope is that some UBS people will simply walk away. ""The ideal is for people to leave of their own accords,"" says one insider, adding that ""a deliberately uncomfortable work environment,"" is one way of prompting this.

Another option is to offer voluntary redundancy payments, which some at UBS say would be perfect now. ""A lot of people have lost their motivation,"" says one insider at the bank, who complains of a ""bad vibe."" He says he would accept voluntary redundancy if it were offered: ""I'd like to leave soon, as these kinds of cuts isn't what I signed up for.""

CVS Health has appointed Brian Newman to the role of chief financial officer, effective April 21, and said that it expects to meet or exceed its latest guidance for the year.

Newman brings to the health solutions company a wealth of experience, most recently serving as executive vice president and CFO of United Parcel Service.

Prior to his time at UPS, Newman was at PepsiCo where he spent the majority of his career. He served for 26 years in finance leadership roles across Europe, Asia and South America, and was executive vice president for PepsiCo's global operations and as chief strategy officer.

Newman takes over the reins from Tom Cowhey, who will transition to a strategic advisory role, supporting Chief Executive Officer David Joyner, effective May 12.

Newman is expected to receive an annual salary of $1 million and will be eligible for a bonus of 150% of his salary based on performance. He's also set to receive an equity award of $7 million made up of a mix of performance stock units, restricted stocks units and stock options.

Additionally, CVS has appointed Amy Compton-Phillips to the role of chief medical officer, effective May 19. Compton-Phillips was most recently chief physician executive of health care performance improvement company Press Ganey, and before that, chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services, a health care system.

In November of last year, CVS shuffled its top executive, bringing in Joyner to head the company in place of Karen Lynch in response to a push for changes by Glenview Capital Management, a major hedge fund, and a board review of strategy that included the option of breaking up the company.

At the time, the company also warned again that its earnings for the year would miss expectations.

On Tuesday, CVS said that it now CVS said it currently expects financial performance will meet or exceed its most recent guidance for full year 2025 based on year-to-date results through February. In February, the company set guidance for adjusted earnings of $5.75 to $6 a share for 2025.

Analysts polled on FactSet expect adjusted earnings of $5.90 a share.

Regionally, the Americas and Asia experienced growth in net revenues by 6% and 7% respectively, while Europe saw a decline in net revenues by 5%.

The company’s direct-to-consumer channels contributed positively with a 9% ascent in net revenues. Wholesale channels faced a downturn with a 3% reduction in net revenues.

A significant turnaround was evident in the company’s profitability, with net income from continuing operations reaching $140m in Q1 FY25, compared to a net loss of $10m in the same period of the previous year.

The rebound was reflected in earnings per share from continuing operations, which stood at $0.35, up from a diluted loss per share of $0.03 in Q1 FY24.

Levi Strauss’ operational efficiency improvements were underscored by an expansion in operating margin to 12.5% and an increase in gross margin of 330 basis points to 62.1%.

The growth in gross margin was attributed mainly to reduced product costs and an advantageous mix of channels and brands.

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin also saw a substantial improvement, climbing by 400 basis points to reach 13.4%, propelled by the enhanced gross margin.

Levi Strauss saw a marginal drop in selling, general and administrative expenses to $749m over the quarter from $756m reported in the first quarter of the previous year.

The company reclassified the Dockers business as discontinued operations in Q1 FY25.

Levi Strauss & Co president and CEO Michelle Gass stated: “We exceeded revenue and profitability expectations in Q1, marking a strong start to the year – another proof point that our transformation strategy is working.

“The Levi’s brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the centre of culture across the globe. While we recognise that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond.”

Levi Strauss has maintained guidance for fiscal 2025 based on continuing operations, excluding the impact of the recent tariffs.

The company anticipates a slight decline in reported net revenue, ranging between 1% and 2%.

Expectations for gross margin are nevertheless optimistic, with an anticipated expansion of 100 basis points to 61.6%.

Tariffs this, tariffs that. Sneakerheads and runners are just wondering how much more their shoes are going to cost because of them.

According to the senior vice president of a federal footwear trade organization, a $155 running shoe could jump to as much as $220. But don’t unlace those runners yet, because other projections are a bit softer, projecting that a Nike Pegasus 41, currently $140, could go up to $157.

Regardless of exactly how much more expensive shoes will be, the hefty tariffs on the countries that manufacture the majority of the country’s footwear come at a less-than-desirable time for the industry leader, Nike.

Nike needs its fans to buy a lot of shoes in the coming months, and even without tariffs, Nike customers were already going to be seeing higher prices than what they were used to for the last few years.

On its latest earnings call, Nike CEO Elliott Hill said the Beaverton, Colorado-based footwear giant would begin moving discounts on its digital platforms to its outlet stores, to ensure its digital business is no longer relying on discounted sales.

Starbucks has reiterated its commitment to the UK market after reporting significant losses and revenue decline last year.

The world’s largest coffee chain posted a £35.2m ($44.8m) loss before tax in the UK for the 12 months ended 29 September 2024, compared to a £16.9m ($21.5m) profit the year previously. Starbucks also reported a 9% fall in gross profit and a 4% year-on-year fall in UK revenues to £525.6m ($668.9m).

In commentary accompanying its results, Starbucks said a challenging trading environment, including high raw material costs, softer consumer spending and ‘widely discussed misperceptions’ about the chain’s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict, had negatively impacted its performance.

Starbucks also highlighted the UK’s ‘highly competitive’ branded coffee shop market as a factor in reduced footfall to its stores, with increased investment in domestic specialty coffee chains challenging the local trading landscape.

World Coffee Portal’s Project Café UK 2025 report shows specialty operators WatchHouse, Black Sheep Coffee, Knoops, Redemption Roasters and BEAR all raised investment over the last 12 months to fund UK expansion.

The UK remains Starbucks’ largest market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. The Seattle-based coffee chain ended the year with 1,240 stores, an addition of 100 net new sites, and has since acquired its largest UK franchisee, 23.5 Degrees, adding a further 113 stores to its company-owned UK estate.

Starbucks expects to open a further 80 net new UK stores by the end of September 2025, retaining a focus on key drive-thru and high-footfall city centre locations.

“It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK. We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year,” said Duncan Moir, President, Starbucks EMEA.

Starbucks UK profits during the period were also impacted by ongoing investments in technology, social media and its Starbucks Rewards loyalty programme, as well as increases in staff wages.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time,” Moir added.",https://www.worldcoffeeportal.com/getattachment/58493c2d-8c46-4e85-a42e-ab038493ebfe/Starbucks_UK_focused_on_‘regaining_momentum’_after_posting_£35.2m_loss.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 10:06:59.670461

Brian Newman has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer designate, effective April 21, and will take over from the current CFO, Tom Cowhey, on May 12. Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as the new executive vice president and chief medical officer on May 19.

Brian Newman, the incoming CFO, previously served as the CFO of United Parcel Service (UPS) and brings a wealth of experience from a nearly three-decade career at PepsiCo. Newman’s leadership at UPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and his tenure in various global finance roles at PepsiCo position him as a strategic addition to the CVS Health leadership team. According to InvestingPro analysis, CVS currently appears undervalued, with multiple analysts recently revising their earnings expectations upward for the upcoming period.

Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips arrives with a distinguished background in healthcare management, most recently as the chief physician executive at Press Ganey. Her prior roles include president and chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services and various positions at Kaiser Permanente. Her appointment underscores CVS Health’s commitment to clinical excellence and patient care.

The company also signaled confidence in its financial trajectory, expecting to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for the full year of 2025. With a healthy 4.17% dividend yield and strong recent market performance, CVS has demonstrated resilience in the healthcare sector. It is important to note that the financial closing procedures for the first quarter are not yet complete, and final figures may be subject to change.

David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health, expressed gratitude to Tom Cowhey for his contributions and welcomed the new executives, emphasizing their potential to propel the company’s strategic vision. Newman and Compton-Phillips also shared their enthusiasm for their new roles, highlighting their commitment to the success and health outcomes of CVS Health’s clients and customers.

These leadership transitions come as CVS Health continues to expand its healthcare services, which include a vast network of retail pharmacy locations, medical clinics, pharmacy benefits management, and health insurance products.

In other recent news, CVS Health has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, payable on May 1, 2025, to shareholders of record by April 22, 2025. This decision highlights the company’s commitment to delivering value to its investors. Additionally, Mizuho Securities has increased its price target for CVS Health to $70 from $58, maintaining an Outperform rating. The analyst, Ann Hynes, cited the company’s ""embedded earnings power"" as a factor in the revised target, reflecting confidence in CVS Health’s financial strength.

In a broader industry context, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a 5.06% increase in Medicare insurer payment rates for 2026, benefiting companies like CVS Health. This rate adjustment is expected to generate over $25 billion in additional revenue for the healthcare insurance sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to resume its lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health’s CVS Caremark, over insulin pricing practices. The case had been paused due to the recusal of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who has now reversed his decision, allowing proceedings to continue.

Lastly, the FDA has authorized Visby Medical’s at-home test for three sexually transmitted diseases, with CVS among companies offering similar at-home testing kits.

Combined, Kroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores and employ hundreds of thousands of workers across the United States.
Meanwhile, both Kroger and Albertsons have quietly begun reducing headcount, further highlighting the instability created by the failed merger.
“The real tragedy of this failed merger is that the logic behind it was sound,” said one retail consultant.
“Without scale, supermarkets like Kroger and Albertsons may slowly lose ground to more agile, tech-savvy competitors.” What’s Next for Kroger?","In a move that has stunned retail analysts and rattled the grocery industry, Kroger has disclosed it spent over $1 billion in a failed bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons — an ambitious merger that regulators ultimately blocked, yet one whose ripple effects continue to be felt across the U.S. food retail landscape.

The Cincinnati-based retail giant revealed in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that the proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons, first announced in October 2022, has cost the company dearly. The breakdown of the billion-dollar loss shows $684 million spent in 2024 alone, primarily on third-party legal and advisory fees, alongside $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

A Costly Gamble on Consolidation

The failed merger was one of the most expensive attempted consolidations in recent grocery retail history. The strategic rationale behind Kroger’s bid was clear: uniting with Albertsons would create a supermarket powerhouse capable of competing with giants like Walmart and Amazon. Combined, Kroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores and employ hundreds of thousands of workers across the United States.

But regulators weren’t convinced. Antitrust lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and attorneys general from multiple states argued the merger would reduce competition, potentially increase grocery prices, and result in widespread job losses. Court proceedings stretched from Seattle to Portland throughout late 2024, culminating in two separate court rulings in December that blocked the deal. Albertsons officially terminated the merger a day later.

More Than Just Legal Fees

Kroger’s billion-dollar bill was not limited to lawyer invoices. The grocer had also secured expensive credit facilities to finance the deal and had entered into agreements with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had planned to purchase nearly 600 stores as part of a divestiture plan to appease regulators. Following the collapse, C&S filed a lawsuit in Delaware, demanding a termination fee.

Albertsons, for its part, wasted no time retaliating — suing Kroger for damages, alleging the Ohio-based chain failed to secure regulatory approval in good faith.

Leadership Shake-Ups and Job Cuts

The fallout hasn’t just been financial. In March, Kroger’s long-serving CEO Rodney McMullen resigned amid an internal investigation into conduct that reportedly violated the company’s code of ethics. Former Staples CEO and Kroger board member Ron Sargent has stepped in as interim chief while a permanent replacement is sought.

Meanwhile, both Kroger and Albertsons have quietly begun reducing headcount, further highlighting the instability created by the failed merger.

A Merger Still Needed for Long-Term Survival?

While the merger is legally dead, analysts warn that its economic and strategic necessity remains very much alive. Both Kroger and Albertsons face growing pressure from online players like Amazon Fresh, warehouse giants such as Costco, and discount-driven newcomers like Aldi and Lidl. The grocery sector is undergoing seismic change, and consolidation is seen by many insiders as not just a growth strategy, but a matter of survival.

Some experts argue that without consolidation, traditional supermarket chains may struggle to keep prices low while managing razor-thin margins in a high-inflation environment.

“The real tragedy of this failed merger is that the logic behind it was sound,” said one retail consultant. “Without scale, supermarkets like Kroger and Albertsons may slowly lose ground to more agile, tech-savvy competitors.”

What’s Next for Kroger?

As Kroger begins picking up the pieces of its abandoned merger, it remains to be seen how the company will redirect its resources. With over 409,000 employees nationwide and 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky alone, the grocer still has a significant national footprint.

However, with a billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet and mounting legal costs, strategic missteps are no longer affordable.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,2025-04-08 08:04:44.801575

According to the company’s report, the Osun-based brewer saw its losses balloon to N113.6 billion in 2024 from N70 billion it recorded in the previous year, rising by 62.5 percent.

The brewer had been on a losing streak since 2018 when it recorded a loss of N3.87 billion. And the loss jumped almost five-fold to N27.79 billion in 2019 and contracted to N16.08 billion in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose again to N17.66 billion in 2021 and even higher to N21.63 billion in 2022.

The recurring losses stem from the brewer’s exposure to foreign exchange which became volatile after the government unified the exchange rate and devalued the naira, leading to about a 70 percent slump of the currency.

Meanwhile, revenue continues to shoot up, reaching a nine-year high and almost doubled in the financial year ended 31 December 2024, indicating strong revenue growth.

Its revenue grew from N260.5 billion in 2023 to N488.9 billion last year, highlighting how the firm has been able to adjust to the shocks witnessed in the last two years.

“While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacts profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities,” the beer maker said in its financial statement.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure,” it added.

The firm continues to grapple with FX-induced losses as its unrealised foreign exchange loss for the year stood at N128.4 billion while the brewers realised foreign exchange loss jumped to N294.1 billion from N14.3 billion in 2023.

Beer makers make use of raw materials such as barley, hops which are largely imported. This meant sourcing and scarce FX, leading to higher input cost in terms of raw materials.

The firm spent more than double to source raw materials in 2024 as cost surged from N25.6 billion in 2023 to N58.14 billion last year.

Obi Achebe, chairman of the board of directors at International Breweries Plc, said in a statement that the repayment of the company’s foreign exchange-denominated loans would propel the firm back to the path of sustainable profitability.

“We are proud of the strides we have made in strengthening our business foundation and positioning for sustainable growth. The repayment of our outstanding $379.9 million loan, enabled by our parent company, AB InBev has bolstered our financial position.

“This recapitalisation not only strengthens our balance sheet but also sets the stage for long-term profitability and growth. We are now better equipped to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and seize new opportunities.”

International Breweries opened its N588 billion rights issue programme on May 21, 2024, where the brewer seeks to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of 2 kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share.

According to a recent statement by the brewer, Achebe also commended the company’s progress, particularly after its rights issue, which enabled the repayment of its forex-denominated loan, which had impacted the company over the years.

“The elimination of our FX exposure will improve IBPLC’s cash flows and will support the company’s return to profitability. The offer was supported by our core shareholder, Anheuser-Busch InBev who followed their rights in full. This is a strong indication of AB InBev’s commitment and belief in the Nigerian market opportunity and overall Nigerian economy,” Achebe said.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-20.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:04:39.636039

The company has officially launched its Denza brand in Europe, aiming to grow its footprint in the region and challenge established luxury manufacturers. The first model to hit European streets will be the Z9 GT, with sales expected to begin by the end of the year.

Denza was originally formed as a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz back in 2011. But despite the star power behind it, the brand struggled to gain traction, selling just 23,000 vehicles in its first decade. Mercedes-Benz began scaling back its involvement in 2022, reducing its stake to just 10 percent before fully exiting the partnership last year. Denza is now entirely under BYD’s control.

Read: BYD’s Denza Z9 GT Rivals Porsche’s Panamera And Taycan For A Fraction Of The Price

The Chinese maker launched the Denza brand at a special event in Milan, Italy, earlier this week. According to BYD’s special advisor for Europe, Alfredo Altavilla, Denza will target traditional premium car buyers and younger customers with a keen focus on technology.

Back in China, BYD operates Denza alongside two other premium sub-brands, Fang Cheng Bao and Yangwang. According to ArenaEV, BYD plans to consolidate Fang Cheng Bao into the Denza lineup for Europe, starting with the Fang Cheng Bao Leopard 5, which will be rebadged as a Denza. It remains unclear whether Yangwang models will also be brought under the Denza umbrella for the European market.

Denza has not announced prices for its European lineup. However, while speaking with Reuters, Altavilla said the Z9 GT will be followed up by the luxurious D9 van at the end of the year. Both models will be built in and exported from China, even though the automaker plans to start building cars at its new plant in Hungary from October.

On paper, the Z9 GT is aimed at the likes of Porsche’s Taycan Sport Turismo, though it beats the German EV on size. It’s over 7.8 inches (200 mm) longer and rides on a wheelbase that’s 8.8 inches (225 mm) longer. Power comes from three electric motors producing a combined 952 horsepower, fed by a 100.1 kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery pack. In China, the company also offers a PHEV version that combines a 2.0-liter turbo engine and three electric motors for 858 hp.

The Z9 GT’s performance numbers may place it in the same conversation as Porsche’s offerings, but its pricing in China suggests a very different customer base. There, Denza’s model is priced between 334,800 and 414,800 yuan (roughly $45,800 to $56,800), while Porsche’s comparable models, like the Panamera Sport Turismo and Taycan Cross Turismo, start around 1,008,000 yuan ($138,000) and stretch well beyond 1,500,000 yuan ($205,000), depending on trim and powertrain.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Denza-Z9-GT-01.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:25.306233

These developments are shaping the landscape for CVS Health and its industry peers, with implications for future operations and investor considerations.","WOONSOCKET, R.I. - CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), a healthcare giant with $370.66 billion in revenue and an $80.5 billion market capitalization, today announced significant changes to its executive team and provided an optimistic outlook for its 2025 financial performance. Brian Newman has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer designate, effective April 21, and will take over from the current CFO, Tom Cowhey, on May 12. Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as the new executive vice president and chief medical officer on May 19.

Brian Newman, the incoming CFO, previously served as the CFO of United Parcel Service (UPS) and brings a wealth of experience from a nearly three-decade career at PepsiCo. Newman’s leadership at UPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and his tenure in various global finance roles at PepsiCo position him as a strategic addition to the CVS Health leadership team. According to InvestingPro analysis, CVS currently appears undervalued, with multiple analysts recently revising their earnings expectations upward for the upcoming period.

Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips arrives with a distinguished background in healthcare management, most recently as the chief physician executive at Press Ganey. Her prior roles include president and chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services and various positions at Kaiser Permanente. Her appointment underscores CVS Health’s commitment to clinical excellence and patient care.

The company also signaled confidence in its financial trajectory, expecting to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for the full year of 2025. With a healthy 4.17% dividend yield and strong recent market performance, CVS has demonstrated resilience in the healthcare sector. It is important to note that the financial closing procedures for the first quarter are not yet complete, and final figures may be subject to change.

David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health, expressed gratitude to Tom Cowhey for his contributions and welcomed the new executives, emphasizing their potential to propel the company’s strategic vision. Newman and Compton-Phillips also shared their enthusiasm for their new roles, highlighting their commitment to the success and health outcomes of CVS Health’s clients and customers.

These leadership transitions come as CVS Health continues to expand its healthcare services, which include a vast network of retail pharmacy locations, medical clinics, pharmacy benefits management, and health insurance products.

In other recent news, CVS Health has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, payable on May 1, 2025, to shareholders of record by April 22, 2025. This decision highlights the company’s commitment to delivering value to its investors. Additionally, Mizuho Securities has increased its price target for CVS Health to $70 from $58, maintaining an Outperform rating. The analyst, Ann Hynes, cited the company’s ""embedded earnings power"" as a factor in the revised target, reflecting confidence in CVS Health’s financial strength.

In a broader industry context, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a 5.06% increase in Medicare insurer payment rates for 2026, benefiting companies like CVS Health. This rate adjustment is expected to generate over $25 billion in additional revenue for the healthcare insurance sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to resume its lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health’s CVS Caremark, over insulin pricing practices. The case had been paused due to the recusal of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who has now reversed his decision, allowing proceedings to continue.

Lastly, the FDA has authorized Visby Medical’s at-home test for three sexually transmitted diseases, with CVS among companies offering similar at-home testing kits.

UK FY24 Operational Updates:

Modest decrease in revenue due to various macro-economic and consumer headwinds. This, coupled with inflationary pressures from commodities such as dairy and cocoa, and investment in our partners’ wages, has created a challenging trading environment.

Despite this, the Company opened 100 new stores, demonstrating a commitment to the region. The Company also plans to open an additional 80 new stores in FY25 in the UK.

The Company invested in digitalization and technology and enhanced its loyalty program by running innovative and engaging campaigns, such as collaborations with the Harry Kane Foundation and Stanley cup. These campaigns contributed to 35% growth in the program’s active members.

The Company’s long-term strategy in the region is aligned to the Global Back to Starbucks strategy, which will see it refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — being a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas.

Duncan Moir, President Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, commented:

“It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK.

“We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards program, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.

“Our success starts and ends with our green apron partners. We would like to thank our over 48,000 partners across EMEA for their hard work in continuing to exceed customer expectations. Together, we are working on delivering growth and ultimately, getting Back to Starbucks.”

UK Overview

The UK remains the Company’s largest market in EMEA. UK operations are captured in the accounts of Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) Limited.

The Company ended the year with a total of 1,240 stores in the UK. Of these, 378 were company-operated stores and 862 were run by licensees – a 30/70 split approximately, which is flat on last year.

The macro-economic and consumer environment dampened consumer demand and Starbucks saw a 4% decline in revenue. Revenue for the period was £525.6m (2023: £547.7m). The Company experienced inflationary pressures on margins from increased input costs such as commodity prices and wage inflation. This led to an operating loss of £27.5m (2023: profit of £21.7m) for the period.

UK Market Trends

The UK coffee market experienced significant headwinds in the financial year which resulted in many consumers adjusting usual spending habits. The cost-of-living pressures accelerated during the period as persistent inflation and higher interest rates left consumers with less disposable income. Widely discussed misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East impacted footfall in some locations in the first half of the year. The UK coffee market has also become highly competitive with new entrants and localised specialty coffee houses investing in new stores.

While the coffee inflationary pressures we observed in 2023 somewhat eased during the fiscal year, higher cost impacts on dairy and cocoa were felt in FY24 which continued to put pressure on margins. Profitability was also impacted by wage inflation as the Company continues to invest in its partners.

Making Starbucks the best job in retail is core to the Back to Starbucks strategy. The Company remains confident that it is heading into FY25 in a strong position to attract and retain key partners for its stores. Further incentives and benefits were provided in the year, including but not limited to salary increases, bonuses and tenure pay. The Company launched a new bonus scheme for store supervisors and baristas, which allows green-apron partners to share in the Company’s success on a more sustainable basis.

During the period, the Company continued to place a strong emphasis on digitalization and technology, enhancing its loyalty program by running innovative and engaging campaigns including collaborations with the Harry Kane Foundation and Stanley cup. These activations led to an increase in customer spend and 35% growth in the program’s active members. The Company will continue to build upon this in 2025 through the rollout of further digital initiatives.

The Company has responded to changing consumer preferences and economic conditions by actively managing its menu offerings and pricing strategies. The trial of freshly baked in-store food products has proved promising and will continue to be rolled out across more stores into FY25 to support consumer convenience. Selected strategic price increases were taken in line with rising input costs.

The Company continued its expansion strategy, delivering on its commitment to open 100 new stores in the UK. New store openings were targeted in key drive-thru and city locations with high traffic and footfall counts.

UK Corporation Tax

The Company reported a UK corporation tax charge of £1.0m (FY23: £7.2m). This reduction reflects the weaker financial performance for the period.

UK FY25 Updates

On the 14 October 2024, Starbucks Corporation acquired 23.5 Degrees Limited, the brand’s largest local licensing operator in the UK, bringing an additional 113 stores under Company Operated Ownership in the UK. This acquisition supports the brand’s growth strategy in the UK and reflects the continued confidence in the market’s long-term outlook. It is anticipated that these stores will be integrated into the Company in due course.

Further to this, the Company plans to open an additional 80 stores in the UK in FY25. Company operated growth in FY25 will prioritize new smaller store format innovation in town locations, drive-thrus, as well as high traffic count locations stores across the United Kingdom.

EMEA Overview

Starbucks EMEA Ltd is the main reporting entity for all Starbucks activities in EMEA – excluding the UK business, which is reported separately, as outlined above.

At the year end, there were 4,862 stores in 42 markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (2023: 4,582 stores).

Starbucks continues to pursue its core strategy of a mostly licensed and franchised operating model in the EMEA region, meaning most of its revenues come primarily from royalty payments. Revenue decreased by 8.8% in the period to $388.0m (2023: $425.4m), driven by the challenging macro-economic backdrop and misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East.

This was compounded by a slight increase in administrative costs to $152.3m (2023: $147.2m), driven by increased headcount, additional activity supporting expansion across EMEA such as marketing, technology and digital support costs, and unfavorable foreign exchange movements.

Profit after tax for the period was $77.1m (2023: $104.7m). This consists of a profit before tax of $114.6m (2023: $141.1m) and a UK corporation tax charge of $37.5m (2023: $36.4m).

EMEA Market Trends

In support of its broader strategy, the Company continued to grow in the region. During the period, it opened 421 new stores. The Company will continue to expand its presence in the region in support of further growth, with plans to open 150 stores in the region (excluding the UK) next year.

As outlined by Brian Niccol in February 2025, the Company expects to work with its partners in the Middle East to open approximately 500 new stores over the next five years.

EMEA corporation tax

Starbucks EMEA Limited reported a UK corporation tax charge of $37.5m for the year, compared to $36.4m for the same period last year.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have raised worries about sudden price increases for goods like apparel and footwear as well as a worldwide recession.

The business stated in January that it would be able to cross-source products thanks to a varied supply chain spanning 25 nations.

Levi’s officials have said that the company only imports around 1 per cent of its goods straight from China into the United States, compared to roughly 5 per cent for Mexico. According to President and Chief Executive Michelle Gass, one of the mitigating steps the company is considering is raising prices, which was described as “surgical.”

Demand for slim and wide-legged jeans has held steady, following competitors like Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap, even if consumers are frugal with their discretionary spending.

The company also stated that it was examining the effects of tariffs and what it could do to lessen those effects in its quarterly filing with regulators.

The company stated that it expected the new tariffs to have a material impact on the results of operations in the 2025 fiscal year. Additionally, it stated that production and distribution could be impacted by the environment.

If these disruptions continue, it might be necessary to change present sourcing procedures, which could affect product costs and, if left unchecked, could have a materially negative impact on the company’s operations and business outcomes, it stated.

During a post-earnings call, CFO Harmit Singh stated that the (tariff) impacts are uncertain, given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented.",https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levi-Strauss-maintains-yearly-sales-and-profit-predictions-amid-tariffs.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 06:04:17.064407

Guttenplan, Jodi Dean, The Nation, Mychal Denzel Smith, www.thenation.com, Bryce Covert",,,,,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/mcdonalds-sexual-harassment-brand-standards/,"She called the McDonald’s corporate human resources hotline to complain that she had been fired for reporting sexual harassment.
Four years ago, McDonald’s promised to take action after allegations emerged of stunningly high rates of sexual harassment at its restaurants.
Neither training mentioned sexual harassment by customers, she alleges, or what to do if it happened.
While mandatory sexual harassment training via computer tutorials or videos has become common, experts say these trainings generally don’t stick with employees.
“I think McDonald’s is probably the worst when it comes to sexual harassment.” Making sure employees feel safe reporting sexual harassment is essential to combating it, experts say.","Rosalia Manuel had worked for McDonald’s for more than 20 years when she was suddenly fired in 2022. Until then, she had been considered “the best employee,” she said, and had worked her way up to shift manager at a location in Saratoga, California. It was a role she took seriously.

That March, after a coworker confided to her that a different shift manager had been following her around, making suggestive comments, and coming on to her, Manuel reported the behavior to the store manager above her. Manuel had never been trained on how to respond to incidents of sexual harassment, she said, but she felt that it was her responsibility to do something.

The shift manager who had been harassing Manuel’s coworker never appeared to receive any discipline. Instead, in July, the store manager suspended Manuel for a week for allegedly failing to take her lunch break on time. When Manuel returned to work, she was told she was being fired for insubordination, according to a complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Manuel had a different theory. She called the McDonald’s corporate human resources hotline to complain that she had been fired for reporting sexual harassment. She was told they would investigate, she said, but she never heard back.

The harasser, however, kept working for McDonald’s. In the fall of 2022, at another McDonald’s location in San Jose, the woman began telling Sindy Pamela Mejia, a new employee, that she had a nice body. According to a complaint Mejia has filed with the California Civil Rights Department, she would simulate sex acts, talk about her sex life, and say things like “Ay, qué rico”: How delicious. She quizzed Mejia about whether she had a husband or a boyfriend, Mejia told me. When Mejia rebuffed her, the woman started bullying her, she said, making fun of her for speaking Spanish and for being Honduran.

Mejia didn’t know what she was supposed to do. When she started working at McDonald’s, she was required to watch several onboarding videos. Two of the videos, each about a minute long, advised employees not to touch each other and to say “Excuse me” if they accidentally bumped into somebody—but they didn’t specify any procedures for responding to sexual harassment, Mejia said.

In December, Mejia decided to report the behavior to her manager. But nothing was done, she said; the harasser once again appeared to escape repercussions. Instead, in January 2023, Mejia’s manager reduced her schedule from 40 hours a week to nearly half that, and then to just 13 hours by March—retaliation for reporting the harassment, Mejia said in her complaint.

Mejia decided to report the harassment again in August 2023, this time to an HR representative, but the situation only grew more unbearable in the months that followed, she said: Her harasser was emboldened and told Mejia that the lack of discipline meant she could do whatever she wanted. She started denying Mejia breaks, even to use the bathroom, and refusing to put in her lunch order so she could eat, Mejia said. Mejia was so disturbed that she would skip meals during her shifts and cry in her car instead.

“Nobody seemed interested in helping me with this situation,” Mejia said in Spanish through an interpreter. The harassment stopped only when the woman left the San Jose McDonald’s in May 2024.

McDonald’s did not respond to requests for comment on the specifics of Manuel’s or Mejia’s allegations. Manuel’s EEOC complaint was settled in March 2023. The California Civil Rights Department has not yet issued a ruling on Mejia’s complaint.

Mejia still works at the McDonald’s in San Jose; it’s difficult to find another job that allows her to pick her children up from school. But as a single mother of two who is now working fewer hours, she said, she has struggled financially, and has taken out loans to pay her rent, buy groceries, and pay her bills. “No puedo sobrevivir“—I can’t survive—she said.

Four years ago, McDonald’s promised to take action after allegations emerged of stunningly high rates of sexual harassment at its restaurants. A 2020 survey had found that three-quarters of female nonmanagerial employees had experienced sexual harassment. The company had faced not just a historic nationwide strike over the problem but dozens of lawsuits accusing it of failing to prevent and address harassment. That same year, The Nation published its own investigation based on a review of 24 legal complaints and conversations with restaurant workers who described rampant verbal and physical harassment, including being grabbed, groped, and threatened with rape. The CEO of McDonald’s at the time, Steve Easterbrook, was fired and then sued by the company later that year for engaging in multiple sexual relationships with subordinates against company policy.

In response to the bad press, McDonald’s announced in April 2021 that it would implement “global brand standards” to create “a culture of physical and psychological safety for employees and customers through the prevention of violence, harassment and discrimination.” The standards would apply, for the first time ever, to franchised as well as corporate-owned restaurants—a significant development given that, globally, 93 percent of McDonald’s locations are franchised. In the past, the company had declined to enforce corporate rules at its franchises and argued that it couldn’t be held liable for sexual harassment at such locations.

Under the new standards, the company said it would require restaurants to establish policies and provide trainings to combat sexual harassment, as well as reporting processes and annual employee and manager surveys. The standards were rolled out over the course of 2021 and took effect in January 2022. All McDonald’s locations were meant to be “assessed and held accountable” to the standards by that date.

Despite the company’s claims that the new standards would fix the problems, an investigation by The Nation and Type Investigations found that little changed in many McDonald’s locations after the standards went into effect. According to legal complaints from 20 workers in California, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas, not only has sexual harassment continued in these places, but when employees have reported it in the hopes that the company would address the situation, nothing was done. Instead, in several cases, workers like Manuel and Mejia said they were punished for coming forward by having their hours cut or even losing their jobs.

There is a likely reason why little has changed, experts say: The global brand standards have been inadequate to the task of preventing sexual harassment.

McDonald’s has not shared the details of the global brand standards publicly. Despite its efforts to keep them secret, however, The Nation and Type Investigations obtained an internal corporate document titled “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” that provides insights into what the standards consist of. This document details the criteria used by McDonald’s to evaluate whether its restaurants and franchises were in compliance with the brand standards after they were implemented, revealing how McDonald’s enforces its new solution. What this document suggests is that, while the requirements adhere to a certain logic for how to prevent and address sexual harassment, they are too broad and vague to be effective.

Eve Cervantez, a lawyer who is leading a class-action lawsuit against McDonald’s, said, “I have not seen that there has been any diminishment in complaints of sexual harassment at McDonald’s, and I have not seen any better response to allegations of sexual harassment since January 2022.” She added, “There’s no way the standards could have fixed the problem, because they’re not really addressing the problem.”

A McDonald’s spokesperson declined to provide details of the global brand standards to The Nation and Type Investigations. In response to a detailed list of questions about the global brand standards and sexual harassment in its restaurants after the standards went into effect, McDonald’s reiterated that it was committed to safeguarding workers and preventing abuse.

“Even one allegation of sexual harassment is too many. McDonald’s believes that every single individual who works under the arches deserves to experience a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace,” the company said in a statement. “To support our commitment to these values, we offer strong guidance aimed at preventing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. At our company-owned restaurants, this includes conducting trainings for all employees, providing resources and materials in the restaurants and offering multiple avenues for reporting concerns. We also provide Franchisees with optional tools and other resources aimed at making their employees feel valued, respected, and supported.”

McDonald’s has opposed the granting of class-action status for Cervantez’s case, Jamelia Fairley and Ashley Reddick v. McDonald’s, which has been ongoing since 2020 and includes complaints from dozens of restaurants in Florida. The company argues that the plaintiffs don’t have enough in common, haven’t provided sufficient evidence to establish a pattern of sexual harassment, and haven’t established that there is a general policy of discrimination; it also said that the restaurants in question had lawful anti-sexual-harassment policies and practices in place.

The allegations extend far beyond Florida, however. The Nation and Type Investigations reviewed three additional lawsuits, including one filed in Texas. In that case, a man named as E.S. alleges that his 15-year-old daughter was raped by a 28-year-old coworker while working at a McDonald’s in the small city of Hearne, less than two months after she was hired in February 2023. The coworker lured her to an area behind the restaurant, then battered and raped her by a dumpster, the suit alleges.

Ad Policy

“We never expected that something like that was going to happen,” the girl’s father told me.

The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault of a child and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. McDonald’s has denied that it bears any legal responsibility in the case, and the franchise denied “each and every” allegation made by the plaintiff. The lawsuit is set for trial in January 2026.

In the aftermath, the girl stayed home from school for about eight months, and as of December she still wasn’t speaking much to her family, her father said. “Before this happened, we used to live in a bubble where everybody in my family was safe. After this happened, it was like somebody popped that bubble.”

“I wish they can change all these McDonald’s,” he added, “so nobody can be hurt again.”

When McDonald’s announced its new global brand standards four years ago, it touted them as the key to eliminating sexual harassment from its restaurants. “There are no shortcuts to ensuring that people feel safe, respected and included at a McDonald’s restaurant. This work starts by taking big, intentional moves,” McDonald’s new CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said at the time.

From the beginning, however, details of what the new policies and procedures consist of have remained secret—even to McDonald’s restaurant employees. Rosalia Manuel told me that she never saw the standards, despite being a shift manager. And Eve Cervantez said she hasn’t encountered a single worker who was aware of the standards’ existence, let alone their content. When Cervantez requested that McDonald’s reveal the standards publicly as part of her lawsuit, McDonald’s argued that they must remain under seal, claiming that they are trade secrets that give the company a “competitive advantage.”

“If these are supposed to be these great standards that are going to help protect women in McDonald’s, why would they need to be under seal?” Cervantez said. A ruling on whether the details of the standards must be made public is still pending.

By choosing to keep the standards secret, McDonald’s could be limiting their effectiveness, said Vicki Magley, a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who studies sexual harassment intervention. “There have to be consistent, distributed, accessible policies and procedures,” Magley continued. “If there is no policy that is clearly written and consistently distributed and that includes very clear procedures, then of course the employees are going to be confused.”

The problems with the standards may extend much further than secrecy, however. The “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document lists three primary criteria that restaurants and franchises had to adhere to in order to pass an inspection by a third-party assessor. The first of these: All restaurants and franchises must have a harassment, discrimination, and no-retaliation policy in place. The second: All employees have to complete anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training within 14 days of being hired. And the third: All restaurants must have a process for employees to report harassment as well as protocols for investigating any incidents.

These criteria are reasonable starting points for implementing anti-harassment efforts. The problem is that, even when taking into account a number of additional sub-criteria outlined in the document, they lack the teeth that many experts consider necessary to combat harassment.

While the company requires restaurants to have a policy in place on sexual harassment, for instance, it doesn’t require them to have a standard way of communicating the policy to employees; according to the document, the policy can be shared via e-mail or text message, outlined in lengthy employee handbooks, or simply reviewed during orientation. The document also does not specify that the policy be written in a language that workers can easily understand or in the language that they speak.

Such fuzziness can undermine any corporate standards from the get-go, experts said. In order to be effective, anti-harassment policies must clearly explain which behaviors are prohibited, describe how to report harassment, and state what workers can expect to happen when a report is made, all in plain language that workers can understand. They can’t simply be handed out once at the start of employment, but need to be reinforced and accessible after that—posted in the break room, for example, or sent on a regular basis. The goal is not only for victims of harassment to know what to do, but also for all employees to understand “what are the behavioral expectations in the workplace,” Magley said.

It is difficult to know precisely why McDonald’s harassment prevention efforts failed in each of the cases reviewed by The Nation and Type Investigations. However, what is clear is that, at all of the restaurants in question, the new global brand standards failed to protect workers as promised.

When Fernando Valencia was hired at a McDonald’s in Vallejo, California, at the end of 2021, he didn’t receive any training, including on sexual harassment, he told The Nation and Type Investigations. This was right before the brand standards went into effect. But even after, at the start of 2022, he was given neither information nor training. Although he heard that there was supposed to be some sort of information posted in the break room about what to do if sexual harassment happened, “No teníamos nada,” he said: They didn’t have anything.

This became a problem when, shortly after Valencia started, a male store manager began harassing him daily, according to a complaint he filed with the California Civil Rights Department, touching his genitalia or making him touch the manager’s genitalia, kissing him, and promising raises for participating. Valencia had recently immigrated from Mexico and didn’t know there were laws against what he experienced, he said. “No sabía cómo eso es, cómo denunciar a eso”: I didn’t know what that was, how to report that. But it weighed heavily on him, turning his workplace into a “nightmare,” he said in Spanish. “It makes you feel small and bad about yourself.”

In June 2022, he decided to tell the manager’s boyfriend what had been happening, and the next month his hours were reduced and he wasn’t given opportunities for overtime pay, he said. It was only then that he and other employees at that location were given sexual harassment training, he said, although new hires were not.

That training was spare, Valencia said. During an eight-hour computer training on how to do the job, he said, only 30 minutes were devoted to how to talk appropriately to coworkers. The digital module warned employees not to touch each other because it could be considered sexual harassment, but it didn’t go into more detail than that. The store’s owners investigated his allegation after he filed his legal complaint, but nothing else was done about the harassment, he said.

The California Civil Rights Department declined to pursue Valencia’s case on his behalf but acknowledged his right to sue. A McDonald’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about Valencia’s case.

At least six other workers whose complaints The Nation and Type Investigations reviewed reported receiving no training at all after January 2022. This should not have happened, according to the “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document. The document is clear that, in order for a restaurant to pass a brand standards inspection, assessors must ensure that it has a training program in place. The document fails to specify, however, what those trainings must consist of; nor does it require any kind of assessment as to whether they are effective or have any impact on the problem of sexual harassment.

The consequences of this lack of muscular requirements became evident in the cases of several workers who did receive training but say it was cursory and digital-only. Two workers in the Florida towns of Apopka and Lakeland who are participants in the Fairley class-action lawsuit said that the anti-harassment training they received after January 2022 consisted of slides in a PowerPoint presentation. Others watched short videos.

“The training in general felt rushed, like they just wanted me to learn how to physically do the job so that I could start working,” Salma Linda Chappa, who was hired at a McDonald’s in Plant City, Florida, in June 2022, stated in a legal filing in Fairley. It was during her orientation that a male manager started hitting on her within earshot of two other managers, who didn’t do anything to stop it, she stated. The harassment prompted her to quit a week later.

Zoe Newsome was already on edge about sexual harassment at McDonald’s before she was hired; female friends had told her they had been sexually harassed working there, she told me. But she needed the money to help her mother with bills, so in September 2021, at age 16, she began working as a crew member at a McDonald’s in Kissimmee, Florida, her first job. During her orientation, she watched a short slideshow that included basic information about sexual harassment. It “only lasted a few minutes and was not very helpful,” she wrote in a legal filing in the Fairley lawsuit.

About a year later, Newsome was promoted to crew trainer and was made to do the same sort of training, watching a “very short” video on harassment and how to report it. Neither training mentioned sexual harassment by customers, she alleges, or what to do if it happened.

Newsome told me that she’s the kind of person who “freezes up when that happens to me,” but if she had been taught what to do in the face of harassment, she might have been more prepared to handle it. “You’re young, it’s your first job, you don’t know what to do,” she said. “It’s kind of like ‘Fend for yourself.’”

McDonald’s did not comment on Newsome’s claims or those of any other worker.

While mandatory sexual harassment training via computer tutorials or videos has become common, experts say these trainings generally don’t stick with employees. “A training video coupled with a policy that’s handed to you is just wholly insufficient to change behavior,” said Gillian Thomas, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, who has represented sexual harassment plaintiffs against McDonald’s.

Instead, experts say, in order to be effective, anti-harassment training should be interactive, delivered by a human instead of a computer, tailored to the audience, and last at least four hours. The training should also be done regularly after people are hired, experts say. And companies should follow up with employees to see whether the training has had an impact.

Effective training is done “in a way that will actually inspire interest, inspire commitment to some kind of behavioral change,” Magley said.

Training is only the first step in addressing sexual harassment. It’s equally important for employees to have channels to report incidents—and for employers to have a clear process for investigating such reports, experts say.

The “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document specifies that restaurants have to make the details of their reporting processes “visible and easily accessible in the restaurant.” This could mean a poster with a hotline number to call with any concerns or a document outlining how to make a report. It also says that restaurants must have a protocol in place for responding to employees who report concerns, but as with the training requirements, it doesn’t specify what those protocols should be. All of the workers who reported harassment after January 2022 said nothing was done.

Ashanti Torres-Rodriguez, who was 16 when she started working at a McDonald’s in Bradenton, Florida, didn’t know what to do when a male coworker in his 40s or 50s began asking her out and making comments about her body; she had never been informed, she told me. After he touched her back one day, she decided to tell her manager, according to a legal filing in Fairley, and when he kept touching her, she reported it to two other managers and eventually to the general manager.

The general manager, who seemed to be friendly with her harasser, didn’t appear to believe her, according to her legal filing. Torres-Rodriguez doesn’t think anyone investigated, and she kept being scheduled to work with the man, who touched her for months, despite her attempts to change shifts. The experience led to frequent panic attacks—so many that her general manager threatened to fire her because they were causing her to have to leave work so often. She quit in June 2022 to get away from the abuse, taking a lower-paying job at Dollar Tree; as of a year ago, she said, her harasser still worked at McDonald’s.

Torres-Rodriguez’s experience is not uncommon. Six other workers involved in Fairley said they were told to report incidents to their managers or the general manager—but they weren’t told what to do if that person failed to act.

On her first day at a McDonald’s in Bradenton in January 2022, Marybeth Wiggins told her manager that the person training her had harassed her, but the manager responded that it was “not a big deal,” according to her legal filing. On her third day, after the person touched her butt, she reported it to a different shift manager, who suggested she wait and, if it happened again, fill out paperwork about it. After another male trainer tried to grab her breasts, she asked a manager to file an official complaint, but once again was met with indifference. “It seemed like managers just wanted the job to get done, no matter what was happening to their employees—they didn’t care if anyone was being harassed,” Wiggins wrote in a complaint in Fairley.

McDonald’s managers also appear to have been ill-equipped to deal with sexual harassment by customers. Customers sexually harassed Zoe Newsome “every few weeks,” she alleges in her legal complaint. One grabbed her wrist whenever she handed food to him. Another told her, “You look like you’re good in bed.” One man in his 50s told her, “You look like an angel, but you’re actually a bad girl,” leaving her with chills and feeling like she was going to throw up.

Early on, Newsome told her manager, who “laughed uncomfortably” and did nothing else. She kept reporting it to various managers, but they never investigated the incidents and never filed any official reports. Nothing was done. Instead, they laughed it off. “They seemed desensitized to it,” she wrote.

“I’m a workaholic, I love to work, but I didn’t feel safe,” Newsome told me. “It honestly made me hate going to work.” She quit in November 2022. “I think McDonald’s is probably the worst when it comes to sexual harassment.”

Making sure employees feel safe reporting sexual harassment is essential to combating it, experts say. Employees should be allowed to report harassment to anyone, not just specific managers. Those managers have to then be trained in how to properly deal with reports—particularly in the fast food industry, where young people are often promoted into leadership—and there have to be visible consequences for any reports found to have merit.

Another important duty of any manager is making sure those who report harassment are protected from retaliation. But four workers say that they faced consequences for speaking up.

Valencia Pratt, who worked at a McDonald’s in Miami Gardens, Florida, in early 2022, while she was pregnant, alleges in a legal filing in Fairley that a male coworker made inappropriate comments to her like “Your booty is big” and “I want to eat your front” every day. Pratt asked to be put on different shifts so she wouldn’t have to work with him; she was fired less than a week later.

Reducing sexual harassment is not simple, but it is also not mysterious. What it requires of employers is a concerted commitment and a determination not simply to check off items on a list but to fundamentally change workplace culture. That’s because workers’ behavior “is guided by organizational norms, by what is and is not appropriate,” said Gillian Thomas, the ACLU attorney. “The only way to move the needle on culture change is through repetition and consistency of message, and having the message come from a variety of places, including from the very top—and then building in consequences when you don’t measure up.”

Experts have provided McDonald’s with a playbook for addressing sexual harassment more effectively. In a class-action sexual harassment lawsuit filed against McDonald’s in Michigan that was settled in April 2022, the plaintiffs sought an injunction to require the company to work with employees to develop mandatory training focused on recognizing, preventing, and addressing sexual harassment in the types of scenarios actually faced by McDonald’s workers.

Their proposal would have required McDonald’s to go farther than the measures the company currently appears to have in place. McDonald’s would have had to revise its anti-harassment policies so they were in plain language; implement a well-publicized process with multiple channels for reporting harassment; develop a protocol for investigating complaints by someone “skilled in conducting and documenting workplace investigations”; and ensure that people who engage in harassment and managers who fail to intervene face consequences.

The proposal would also have required practices to prevent retaliation and a system to monitor complaints and their resolutions, plus metrics to ensure that franchises prevent harassment and are penalized if they don’t. The settlement in the case meant that McDonald’s did not have to make these changes.

Instead, for many McDonald’s workers, the current global brand standards have not done enough to keep them safe. The consequences for some have been devastating.

Rosalia Manuel hasn’t worked since she was fired from the McDonald’s in Saratoga, California, in 2022. She’s had to seek out therapy, and her depression has been hard on her four children. Her family has had to rely on her husband’s income as a cook at Google and the money the couple makes cleaning carpets on the weekends. But that still isn’t enough to cover their rent, car payments, and food.

As difficult as the situation is, however, Manuel says that it’s the lack of accountability for those who did nothing to stop the harassment that she finds most frustrating.

Kirke, with the apparel federation, says the new tariffs are hitting the industry particularly hard because they seem to come out of left field.

""One of my members called this 'tariff hell,'"" said Bob Kirke, executive director of the Canadian Apparel Federation.

Retail groups in the U.S. have similarly warned that tariffs on Asian countries, where most American clothing is manufactured, will mean a steep uptick in prices ahead of the back-to-school season.

While the Canadian apparel sector wasn't targeted directly by the tariffs, many companies headquartered here make their products overseas and sell to customers south of the border.

Canadian retail giants like Aritzia, Lululemon and Gildan saw their stock tumble after the tariffs were announced last week by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Access to the U.S. market is critical for brands in this country if they hope to grow past a certain point, says Emma May, founder of the Calgary-based womenswear brand Sophie Grace.

""The U.S. market's amazing, it's huge,"" said May, who has customers on both sides of the border. ""We solve the same problem for the U.S. customer that we solve for a Canadian customer and there are 10 [times as many] of them.""

But May is starting to reconsider some of her U.S. expansion plans.

Her clothes are made in China and warehoused in Canada, where they are shipped to U.S. e-commerce customers. On top of an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods imposed last week, the White House has also said a previous exemption, that allowed small orders from China into the U.S. without tariffs, is closing.

""Maybe the U.S. market is just not something we can go at because our products will end up being just far too expensive for that customer,"" said May.

It's unlikely the U.S. will allow loopholes for Chinese-made products that make a pit stop in Canada before being sold in the U.S., says trade lawyer John Boscariol.

The Trump administration ""is trying to close up any loophole or potential exemption,"" said Boscariol, a partner with McCarthy Tetrault in Toronto.

And while clothing is a prime example, Boscariol says many Canadian businesses are likely dealing with the same problem.

""Whether you're in clothing, apparel items, toys, whatever... whether that's China, Vietnam or any other country in Asia that's now been targeted with very significant tariffs, you're going to be impacted by this in terms of your access to the U.S. market.""

Why not change factories?

Jeremy Oldland, co-owner of the Montreal kids clothing company Hatley, manufactures his products in China and India. He supplies pint-sized rain boots, pajamas and jackets to department stores, boutiques and e-commerce customers south of the border.

U.S. sales make up about half his revenue, says Oldland, and he expects that imposing a new surcharge on all those orders will spur a wave of cancellations.

""We're going to sell less product. It's going to hurt any way you do it,"" he said. And yet shifting supply chains out of Asia to North America would be difficult.

""We don't have the tradesmanship, the craftsmanship, we don't have the printing techniques, we don't have a lot of things [in Canada].""

Kirke, with the apparel federation, says the new tariffs are hitting the industry particularly hard because they seem to come out of left field.

In recent years, growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China have prompted some larger retailers to start shifting production outside of that country, a move that was also driven in part by reports of forced labour in China's Xinjiang region.

But now, the U.S. is also going after smaller manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where companies had previously been trying to diversify their production.

""That's a hard, hard thing to deal with,"" said Kirke.

Kirke says he is glad that the U.S. tariffs don't hit Canadian-made products, though this is a relatively small portion of the total industry.

The hope, he says, is that Trump will change course and back down on his tariff policy.

As for May, with the brand Sophie Grace, she hopes to continue growing her business — but with an emphasis on customers north of the border.

""We will obviously be looking to retrench in the Canadian market and then also explore other markets like Australia and Europe,"" she said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7504382.1744071082!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/sophie-grace.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:36.342220

The closure will impact approximately 230 employees, and Danone has committed to providing fair social plans, retraining programmes and continued employment opportunities within the company for those affected.

Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, acknowledged the difficulty of this decision, highlighting the commitment of the Ochsenfurt employees and the plant's long-standing legacy.

“We have grown in an extremely challenging environment in the German-speaking region in recent years and are strongly positioned for the future. I am very proud of what we have achieved as a team,” he said. ""Nevertheless, the plant in Ochsenfurt is not sustainable in the current market situation.

Hecontinued: ""There is less consumer demand for the locally manufactured products and high-potential Danone products cannot be produced locally. I very much wish we didn't have to make these plans for Ochsenfurt. In this context, I can only assure all employees that we will do everything we can to find another position at Danone for as many employees as possible.”

Despite the closure, Danone is reaffirming its commitment to the German market, with plans to concentrate production efforts at its Fulda site, which specialises in baby formula and medical nutrition.

The Fulda facility is one of Danone's largest in the region, employing nearly 600 staff members. The company intends to invest significantly in this site as part of its ‘Renew Danone’ initiative, aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and product specialisation.

Updated On Apr 8, 2025 at 12:40 PM IST

Levi Strauss posted first-quarter profit that beat estimates on Monday, as higher full-price selling of its bottom wears and cost-saving efforts boosted the denim maker's margins.

Shares of the company, down about 22 per cent this year, rose about 2 per cent in extended trading as Levi maintained its full-year forecasts for sales and profit, which did not account for any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up - a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie and Fitch and Gap - despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

Advt

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike to Target.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty - which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1 per cent for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8 per cent last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

It posted a 3 per cent rise in revenue from continuing operations to $1.53 billion, which excluded sales from its Dockers brand, now reclassified as a discontinued operation.

Analysts, on average, were expecting a 1 per cent drop in revenue to $1.54 billion, as per data compiled by LSEG, including Dockers.

[READ MORE: Instacart launches business-to-business marketplace]

Will Call Delivery is a white-label solution built for distributors to streamline same-day ordering via their sales reps. Business-to-business and wholesale customers that need items fast can order from their sales reps as usual, and the sales reps can then request an Instacart shopper pick up specific, high-priority items from their warehouse and deliver to their end customers, all in a couple of clicks.

In addition, in an effort to better address out-of-stocks or service customers that are far from the warehouse, distributors have the ability to place orders from retailers on the Instacart marketplace that are closer to their end customers.

This personalized, targeted fulfillment option is designed for circumstances such as when a restaurant owner needs a case of limes or chicken breasts hours before the dinner rush.

All Instacart shoppers have access to comprehensive shopper educational modules covering a variety of food safety topics, including personal hygiene, cross-contamination, time/temperature control for safety (TCS) foods, and storage and transportation tips.

According to Instacart, it will be expanding Will Call Delivery and partnering with additional distributors in 2025 to bring the service, currently in pilot with select companies, to a wider group of businesses.

A global luxury brand is AI-enabling its leather goods production and procurement planning capabilities.

Based in Milan, Italy, Prada Group operates brands including Prada, Miu Miu, Church’s, Car Shoe and Marchesi 1824. The company is implementing the artificial intelligence-based o9 Digital Brain platform in an initiative to approve leather goods production orders more efficiently.

Prada Group will tailor reports to support near real-time procurement decisions and leverage root-cause analysis reporting across its highly complex, multi-tier global supply chain to provide insights across ongoing and upcoming production flows.

As a result, the company seeks to help planners anticipate and proactively mitigate potential leather goods supply chain issues, develop finished goods and semi-finished goods production plans, provide greater visibility into capacity at internal factories and external suppliers, and align raw material procurement with production plans.

“o9 is pleased to partner with Prada Group on its journey to optimize production planning with a world-class platform that mitigates potential risks that could create capacity bottlenecks, and to develop processes that enable smarter procurement, planning, and decision-making,” said Chakri Gottemukkala, o9 co-founder and CEO. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Prada Group in the years to come.”

Prada Group also uses cloud-based solutions from Oracle Retail and Adobe to help collect and analyze customer data to enhance personalization and targeted promotions.

In addition, in summer 2024 the company began deploying the Adyen financial technology platform across all of its retail channels with the goal of creating unified customer experiences, including ""tap to pay"" payment.

Cincinnati-based supermarket giant Kroger reported this month that its aborted takeover of Albertsons cost the company more than $1 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The nation’s largest traditional supermarket operator disclosed it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs” mostly on “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs),” according to its annual report filed on April 1. The latest bills were on top of $316 million spent in 2023 and $44 million spent in 2022. The grocer first announced the proposed deal in October 2022.

Lawyers and other consultants were busy in 2024

Last year was the busiest of Kroger’s merger gambit: antitrust regulators including the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from Washington state and Colorado filed separate lawsuits to kill the $25 billion proposed transaction; from August to October, the merits of and objections to the deal were argued in courtrooms in both Seattle and Portland, Oregon; and in December, two separate judges, one federal and one from Washington state, issued rulings blocking the deal, which prompted Albertsons to call the deal off a day later.

Critics of the proposed $25 billion merger said the deal would give Kroger too much power in the marketplace. They also argued it could worsen rampant inflation that drove overall supermarket prices 25% higher after the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.

Lawsuits could add to the final merger tab

In the collapsed deal’s aftermath, there may be further costs: Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons sued Kroger the same day it pulled out of the deal, blaming the grocer for botching regulatory approval. And last month, Kroger’s former proposed divestiture partner, C&S Wholesale Foods, which stood to acquire nearly 600 stores if the merger went through, filed a lawsuit in Delaware, claiming Kroger owed the New Hampshire-based company a termination fee for the canceled deal.

Both retailers have announced the departures of their respective CEOs; and both grocers have cut jobs. In March, Kroger announced Rodney McMullen, CEO since 2014, had resigned amid an investigation into his “personal conduct” that “was inconsistent” with the grocer’s policy of business ethics.

Kroger has launched a search for a new CEO and is currently being led by Ron Sargent, 69, a board member and former Staples CEO.

Based in downtown Cincinnati, Kroger employs 409,000 workers nationwide, including roughly 20,000 in Greater Cincinnati. Kroger operates 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, employing 14,500 associates.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/04/PCIN/75070320007-kroger-albertsons-mashup.png?crop=4070,2290,x0,y212&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-08 01:59:44.276241

Trump fired back on Monday, threatening an additional 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't remove its US tariffs.","Levi's (LEVI) execs just gave a market nervous over bruising tariffs a taste of what's to come for earnings season.

A heavy dose of confusion, with a lack of clear cut guidance for investors in search of badly needed clarity.

""Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible,” Levi's long-time CFO Harmit Singh said on a late Monday earnings call.

“For now, our full-year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.""

Levi's CEO Michelle Gass said the company has assembled an internal ""task force"" to determine the tariff impact and proper responses, such as price increases.

The company relies on 130 facilities in China and 50 in Vietnam — two countries Trump earmarked for large tariffs — to produces its various apparel offerings.

At least for now, the market thinks Levi's may be able to overcome some tariff headwinds.

Shares rallied more than 10% in pre-market trading on Tuesday on the unchanged profit outlook and a 10 cent quarterly earnings beat. Execs said on the call that demand remained solid through the end of March.

Levi's shares were among the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform.

But whether the post earnings rally can be sustained is up in the air.

President Trump uncorked a baseline tariff rate of 10% that went into effect on Apr. 5.

A higher tariff rate will start on Apr. 9 for about 60 countries that the administration considers to be the worst trade offenders.

Some of those nations are important sourcing and business regions for large US retailers in Levi's and Nike (NKE). China, for example, will see reciprocal tariffs of 34%. Vietnam clocks in at 46%.

The reciprocal tariffs are on top of existing duties, such as the 20% Trump imposed on China earlier, bringing the total rate on the country to 54%.

China has retaliated with a 34% tariff on American goods. Trump fired back on Monday, threatening an additional 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't remove its US tariffs.

""Levi’s isn’t immune to cost shocks or consumer slowdown: for sensitivity, we estimate tariffs could represent a high-single digit percentage hit to calendar 2026 earnings power assuming no degradation in consumer demand; and could represent mid-teens percentage hit to calendar 2026 earnings power assuming a mid-single digit percentage impact to quantity demanded,"" Stifel apparel stock analyst Jim Duffy said in a note on Tuesday.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UVAlC0uQcajskoeN1WhdFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/520fd020-1407-11f0-aa9f-77c4b84a8f8c,N,,2025-04-08 05:03:35.375572

(Reuters) - CVS Health's chief financial officer, Thomas Cowhey, intends to step down, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, amid the health insurer's ongoing efforts to effect a turnaround spearheaded by CEO David Joyner.

Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the situation, said the timing of Cowhey's departure was unclear but did not give a reason for the CFO leaving.

CVS declined to comment to Bloomberg and did not immediately respond to a Reuters email for comment.

Cowhey was appointed CFO in January 2024 after holding the position on an interim basis since October 2023.

CVS, facing financial struggles over the past few years and pressure from investors, missed its earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024.

It also withdrew its annual forecast as it announced Joyner's appointment last October.

The new CEO laid out cost-cutting plans and named a new insurance head to help navigate one of the most challenging periods in the company's six-decade history.

In February, CVS eventually managed to beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profit and provided an annual forecast that largely met expectations.

(Reuters) -Levi Strauss maintained on Monday its annual forecast for sales and profit, excluding the impact of tariffs, and posted quarterly profit ahead of Wall Street targets, sending its shares up more than 7% in after hours trade.

Sweeping tariffs by President Donald Trump have sparked concerns over a global downturn and sharp price hikes for items such as clothing and footwear.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" President and Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement on Monday.

The company said in January that a diverse supply chain across 25 countries would allow it cross-source products.

Levi imports only about 1% of its merchandise directly from China into the U.S., while that for Mexico was about 5%, its executives said in January.

The retailer is looking at price increases as one of the mitigating measures, said Gass, adding that price increases will be ""surgical.""

It has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up - a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap - despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

In its quarterly filing with regulators, the company added that it was analyzing the impact of tariffs and what it could do to minimize impact.

""We expect these new tariffs to have a material impact on our results of operations in fiscal year 2025,"" it added.

It also said the environment could affect production and distribution.

""If these disruptions persist, they may require us to modify our current sourcing practices, which may impact our product costs, and, if not mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,"" it warned.

""Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the (tariff) impacts are uncertain,"" CFO Harmit Singh said on a post-earnings call.

Rachel Wolff, an analyst at eMarketer, said, ""Levi Strauss (NYSE: )’ unchanged forecast shows the sheer impossibility of planning ahead, as uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff moves paralyzes brands.""

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

The company expects fiscal 2025 net revenue to be down in the range of 1% and 2% and adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 per share.

On an adjusted basis, it earned a profit of 38 cents per share in the quarter, compared to estimates of 28 cents.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 22:01:55.589040

In response, the US-listed company said: “We have no political agenda. We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere — and never have.”

It also wrestled with new entrants into the UK’s “highly competitive” coffee market as well as cost of living pressures squeezing disposable income. A weaker consumer environment coincided with inflationary pressures for commodities such as dairy and cocoa and wage inflation.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macroeconomic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology

across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme and further

optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.”

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Levi Strauss , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $1.53 billion for the quarter ended February 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.95%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.56 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

What's Next for Levi Strauss?

While Levi Strauss has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Levi Strauss: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.16 on $1.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.27 on $6.27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the bottom 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Floor & Dcor (FND), another stock in the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025.

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Floor & Dcor's revenues are expected to be $1.16 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers.
Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries, adding they are “the places that you’d expect in the apparel industry”.
Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.","[NEW YORK] Levi Strauss maintained a full-year outlook that excludes the impact from sweeping new US tariffs that are poised to significantly raise costs for multinational apparel companies.

The San Francisco-based company said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi sees organic revenue growth, which excludes items such as currency impact and divestments, growing 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year.

Shares rose 2.1 per cent at 4.55 pm in extended New York trading. Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Apr 2, the stock has declined 19 per cent.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers. He said the company is focused on issues it can control such as its relationships with vendors and the cost base for its products.

Chief executive officer Michelle Gass said the company is approaching the topic of tariffs with “urgency, but not being overly reactive”.

Levi is one of the first retailers to report earnings after Trump unveiled the tariffs last week.

The company says it sources about 5 per cent of its goods in the US from Mexico, a mid-single digit from Vietnam and 1 per cent from China. It works with 130 facilities in China, 50 in Vietnam, 37 in Bangladesh and 36 in Sri Lanka, according to a company website listing partners in its supply chain.

Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries, adding they are “the places that you’d expect in the apparel industry”.

“We are doing our homework,” she added, without offering more details on specific measures the company is taking to counteract the tariffs. If the company needs to raise prices, it would be “surgical”, Gass said, and be focused on new products that have resonated with shoppers.

In its release, the company said it has “secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders” in the second quarter.

In the first quarter, the company posted earnings of 38 US cents a share, higher than the average analyst estimate. Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.

The company is focused on bolstering its namesake brand and increasing sales through its own channels, such as its stores and website.

Today’s call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.

And now I’d like to turn over the call to Michelle. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to today’s call. I’m pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start, and our shift to becoming a DTC first company is driving both strategic and financial value. In q one, we exceeded expectations across sales, margins, and EPS, driven by the momentum of our strategy. We again achieved high single digit organic net revenue growth, up 9%.

Direct to consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings, and strong e com performance. Our wholesale business delivered another quarter of positive growth, up 5%. Our US business further accelerated, up 8%, while international was strong as well, up nine percent. And we extended our market leadership with share gains across both women’s and men’s. I am proud we are able to deliver these strong results while fundamentally changing the way we work as part of our hard pivot towards becoming a best in class omnichannel retailer.

Given last week’s tariff announcements, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment. However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times. As an iconic brand with more than a hundred and seventy years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality, and that’s what Levi’s has always stood for.

Today, almost 60% of our revenue is generated outside The US. We have scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty. I’ll now walk you through highlights from the quarter in the context of our strategy. Note that all numbers that Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis and exclude jockers, which as you saw in our release, has been moved to discontinued operations as we explore a sale of the brand. Let’s start with our first strategy, being brand led.

The Levi’s brand was up 8% for the quarter and continued to reach new levels of strength all over the world. While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. You can see that through our partnership with the most influential artist of our generation, Beyonce. Since launching Reimagine in September of twenty twenty four, the campaign has generated more than 4,300,000,000 impressions and more than $65,000,000 in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our market. As another proof point in our ongoing efforts to drive brand heat, this last quarter, the Levi’s brand was featured in a complete unknown, a highly celebrated biopic of Bob Dylan starring Timothee Chalamet.

Bob Dylan, known for his love of Levi’s, has shaped and defined culture across many decades. To commemorate the film’s release, we launched a limited edition collection featuring some of Bob Dylan’s wardrobe staples. This example of how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future is further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage. We are also partnering with authentic, locally influential icons to drive brand heat and anchor the brand at the center of culture across the globe. Earlier this month, we expanded our partnership in India with Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosan and launched a new campaign in Germany with Stephanie Geisinger, strengthening our appeal with consumers in both of these important markets.

And as a testament to the strength of the Levi’s brand, we gained market share in men’s and women’s in the quarter, further solidifying our number one position in denim across both categories. And consistent with our strategy to recruit younger fans to the brand, we also grew share with our 18 30 year old target consumer demographic. These consumers transacted a higher AUR and purchased more frequently than our average consumer. Moving to product. While our history is built on jeans, our future will be built around lifestyle, always rooted in denim.

For most of our history, we’ve been known as a men’s jeans business. But to achieve our bold aspirations, we need to be more. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly expanded our head to toe offering, especially with women, while maintaining our dominance with men. This enables us to further expand our already large total addressable market. And as a result, women’s continued to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues.

Tops represents more than 20% of our business, which has more than doubled over the last ten years. Inspired by denim lifestyle, newer categories such as dresses, skirts, and outerwear continue to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the business. And while we’re the leader in jeans, our portfolio beyond denim bottoms now comprises 35% of our total sales. As we diversify our product portfolio, we also remain laser focused on our core Levi’s bottoms business. And in q one, bottoms were up 9%, driven by strength in both men’s and women’s.

The continued success we’ve achieved in bottoms is attributable to our fit diversification strategy. We have a style for everyone for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15% of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Finch Faggy available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volume surpassing 200,000,000.

And with men, we’ve been focused on expanding this trend through new fit launches, like the five sixty eight loose straight and the five seventy eight baggy. While there’s so much buzz around the loose and baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20% of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses. We continue to infuse innovation and newness into these styles with a robust pipeline of new fits, finishes, and fabrics. Our men’s classic five eleven slim fit is a great example now offered across the range of fabric, washes, colors, as well as part of our new tech series, earning us more space in his closet. As part of our denim lifestyle strategy, tops remain a key growth category for us.

And in the quarter, tops grew 7%. We’re seeing stronger growth in our direct to consumer channel, up low double digits, where we offer our broadest assortment. There is a long runway for growth in our tops business, and the strong demand we’re seeing in our DTC channel give us great confidence that this will scale to be a meaningful part of our business over time. Our pipeline of newness and innovation remains robust, and I’m confident this will continue to drive impact and resonate with our fans. We continue to see an opportunity to further premiumize the brand with the global launch of the Levi’s Blue Tab collection.

Introduced in Asia earlier this year, Blu Tab paired our iconic Levi’s aesthetic with the quality and sensibility of Japanese craftsmanship. Our most elevated expression of denim leadership to date, the collection features iconic denim staples along with new tops, skirts, and outerwear. And building on the success of our lightweight denim collection, we’re excited to introduce our newest innovation, linen and denim, combining the authentic feel of blue jeans with soft, light linen. Now shifting to our strategy to be DTC first. Our global direct to consumer business delivered another quarter of double digit growth, up 12% and posting its twelfth consecutive quarter of positive comp.

AURs in the channel were up mid single digits as customers are gravitating to more premium products as well as an intentional reduction in promotion in our stores. DTC productivity actions, including improving the front of house consumer experience and back of house efficiency, are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel. I see firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team. Our stores today reflect a more robust head to toe offering compared to when we were mainly a men’s denim bottoms destination, and we’re now showcasing a broader denim lifestyle assortment through tops, dresses, outerwear skirts, and both denim and nondenim bottoms. Our inventory levels are healthier with better in stock availability, and we’re equipping our stylists with enhanced product knowledge and improved selling techniques.

The results of all of this work are more productive and profitable doors, increasing our conviction that we can build several hundred more stores in the future. And we are on that path today. In q one, we continued executing our retail expansion plan. Notable openings include Rome on Via Cola Di Renzo, 1 of the most renowned shopping streets in Italy, and continued expansion across Mexico and India as we grow our retail footprint in these important markets. We have abundant opportunity to increase our DTC presence in major markets all around the world, including here in The US.

Our efforts to accelerate our performance in our ecommerce business are working with a channel up 16% in q one on top of 13% in the prior year. Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our econ channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment, and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience. We have upgraded the content on our site with higher quality imagery that focuses on our lifestyle assortment and enhanced storytelling. We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our product in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for The US E Com business rising to its highest level ever.

Today, comprising just 12% of our total company net revenues, we believe that e commerce represents another significant engine for growth. DTC ended the quarter at 52% of total global net revenues, up two points to last year, accounting for over half of our total revenue, a milestone as we transform into a DTC first company. We are also encouraged by the performance in our global wholesale channel, up 5%, driven by strong growth in The US. US wholesale exceeded our expectations in the quarter, up 9%, in part driven by door expansion and more space with our broadened lifestyle assortment. Our Levi’s women’s business was a particular bright spot, up 17%.

Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, US department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was ten years ago. Signature, our value brand, also grew this quarter, up 19%, driven by strength in our seasonal fit. And as we look to the balance of the year, we remain prudent as respect global wholesale. We continue to expect the channel to be flat for the full year on an organic basis, and this continues to be an important profitable channel for us. Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio.

Our international business represents close to 60% of our total business today, up 9% in q one, driven by growth in Mexico, The UK, France, and Germany. International growth remains an important opportunity for us long term, and we continue to believe that we are underpenetrated. Beyond yoga was up 10% in q one.

Unidentified Speaker: We

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: are continuing to focus on brand building initiatives to drive awareness and profitable growth. Customers are responding to our broad assortment of colorways and styles, as well as new products like our luxe fleece collection, expanded outerwear assortment, and our lifestyle status trousers. And comp sales in our small but growing network of stores were positive for the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We recognize that the environment around us continues to have uncertainty, and we’re focused on the things we can control.

Our first quarter performance demonstrates how our transformation into a best in class lifestyle retailer is accelerating both the top line and the bottom line. Our key strategies of being brand led, DTC first, and powering our portfolio, along with our efforts to rewire our company to be faster and more consumer obsessed, are working and are gaining momentum. Our team is focused on executing with excellence, and I’m grateful to our employees around the globe for their commitment to the change underway and for their unwavering dedication to consistently deliver for our fans. I am confident we have the right foundation to capture the opportunity ahead and deliver profitable long term growth for all of our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Harmit to provide a financial overview of the quarter and our expectations for the year.

Harmit?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Michel. We started the year with momentum. Our financial results were better than expected, and our transformation to a DDC first lifestyle business is making real progress. As you saw in this morning’s press release, Dockers has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As you will notice, while Dockers was a positive contributor to sales, our gross and operating margin structure is higher, excluding Dockers, thereby improving the structural economic and profitability of our remaining business.

Our focus on structural economics is reflected in the fact that net revenues, margins, expenses, and EPS were all better than expected. While global wholesale net revenues were up for the second consecutive quarter, our direct to consumer business continues to lead our growth, with net revenues up 12% as we consistently execute the three things that matter most in this channel, what I call a trifecta, positive comp sales, opening high performing stores, and growing ecommerce profitability. Besides the double digit top line growth, our direct to consumer EBIT margins grew 500 basis points in the quarter, contributing to the company’s overall margin expansion. This is helping drive sustainable sequential progression across our p and l. Q one twenty five organic net revenues accelerated to 9% versus flat in q one twenty three and ’24.

Gross margin was a record at 62.1 this quarter versus 58.2 in q one twenty four and fifty six point five in q one twenty three. Given our expense discipline in q one, we were also able to leverage adjusted SG and A margin by 70 basis points, all of which drove 400 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% versus 9.4% in q one twenty four and eleven point five percent in q one twenty three. Now turning to a brief review of our results. 9% top line growth was driven by better than expected performance in both direct to consumer and wholesale channels. Two third of the growth was driven by units and a third by higher AURs.

Turning to margins, we continue to see expansion in both our gross and operating margins. Gross margin for q one was 52.1 percent of net revenues, a new record. Gross margin expanded 330 basis points relative to last year, driven primarily by the continued benefit of lower product costs, favorable channel and brand mix, and higher full price selling. Adjusted SG and A expenses in the quarter were up 2% versus prior year to $744,000,000 from higher distribution expenses driven by a transition to a hybrid 3PL structure. We were pleased to see our adjusted SG and A rate of 48.7% improve after last quarter’s elevated levels, leveraging 70 basis points versus prior year.

Gross profit dollars growth outpaced the adjusted SG and A dollar increase, delivering a flow through of 84%, driving adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 400 basis points to 13.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at 38, well ahead of our expectations and up 52% to prior year. We ended the quarter with reported inventory dollars up 7% to the prior year. We feel comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and have secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders for quarter two. In the quarter, as planned, we closed 21 net stores as a system.

However, this consists of 30 new store openings, primarily full price Levi’s brand stores and 51 closures, which were mostly underperforming franchisee stores in China. Our disciplined fleet review process ensures that the doors we are opening are productive, and only the most profitable with the highest return opportunity remain open. In the quarter, we returned 81,000,000 to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which were up 12% to prior year. In quarter two, we have declared a dividend of 13¢ per share, an increase of 8% versus prior year. Now let’s review the key highlights by segment.

The Americas net revenues were up 11%, fueled by double digit growth across both direct to consumer and wholesale. In The US, net revenues were up 8% driven by high single digit growth in both channels. Our business in Mexico was up 6% from increased traffic in our stores as well as ecommerce growth. For the segment, strong gross margin and SG and A leverage led to operating margin of 21.7, improving three seventy basis points to prior year. Europe was positive for the third consecutive quarter.

Net revenues were up 3% in q one, led by double digit growth in key markets like The UK and Germany. Direct to consumer continued to accelerate this quarter, up 11%, supported by comp stores, ecommerce, and more full price sales. While wholesale shipping was down in the quarter, given the transition of our distribution center in Germany, we expect wholesale in this segment to return to growth in quarter two and have strong pre book orders, up mid to high single digits for spring and summer. Gross margin expansion drove operating margin to leverage a 20 basis points versus prior year to 25.6%. Asia net revenues increased 10% compared to prior year.

Direct to consumer net revenues were up 14, led by double digit growth in key markets like Japan, Korea, and Turkey. Our South Asia, Middle East, and Africa business, which includes India, was also up double digits this quarter as improved in store retail experiences drove higher UPT and better conversion rates in addition to growth in wholesale. This quarter, our China business was flat to prior year, and we continue to have modest expectations in ’25 as our work to reset this market is underway. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 200 basis points to last year from stronger gross margin. Now turning to our full year and quarter two guidance.

We had a strong first quarter with broad based strength across segments, channels, and categories delivering a notable beat for the quarter, and we saw solid trends continue through March. However,

Unidentified Speaker: as

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you all know, there were changes to the tariff structure announced a few days ago. Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation, and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.

Our q two outlook remains consistent with our internal plan. The impacts of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in The US. As a reminder, q two is seasonally our lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year. For quarter two, we expect organic net revenue growth from continued operations of three and a half to four and a half percent. This excludes approximately two points of foreign exchange headwinds and one and a half points attributable to the exit of Denizen and our footwear business, which implies being flat to up 1% for the quarter on a reported basis.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 basis points to a hundred basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of five and a half percent to 6%. This translates to an adjusted diluted EPS of approximately eleven to thirteen cents, which includes around 3¢ headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate versus prior year. With this expectation, our profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, up approximately 20% versus h one twenty four. In closing, I will leave you with three thoughts. First, while the tariffs announced last week pose a significant challenge for us and the industry, our business and our brands have endured for one hundred and seventy years, proving our resilience.

Today, the Levi’s brand is stronger than ever with diversified global revenue, solid margin structure, a giant sourcing base with deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet. We are well positioned to manage through this uncertain time. Second, we delivered strong first quarter results, and we’re starting the year with momentum. Our new products are resonating and driving market share gains. We have a robust product pipeline that will fuel growth in our denim and non denim business for the rest of ’25 and beyond.

We’re making incredible progress on growing the direct to consumer channel to a longer term goal of 55% of our business while also growing wholesale. Third, we are both transforming our business while delivering strong financial results and improving our structural economics as we continue on our path to becoming a $10,000,000,000 company with 15% operating margin. I will now open up the line for q and a.

Conference Operator: You. The floor is now open for questions. Due to time constraints, the company requests that you ask only one question. If you have an additional question, please queue up again. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing 11 again.

Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Laurent?

Unidentified Speaker: Good afternoon, Michelle and Harmit. Thanks for taking our question. With tariffs front and center on everyone’s mind, can you provide a percentage breakdown of sourcing by key countries for the investors on this call? What are your suppliers saying about providing potential concessions? And then on passing some of the tariffs down the value chain, how much and when do you think you can raise pricing?

Thank you very much.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Hi, Laurent. Thanks for the question. So let me just take a step back for a minute. And obviously, the news on tariffs is very new.

It’s fluid. This was just a couple of days ago and I think we like the industry are getting our arms around it. I would say that as we enter in this period, we are coming from a place of strength. We have momentum on the business, the brand’s never been stronger and we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate.

And you’ve named a couple of them, but I’d first start with the structural changes, cost structure that we can make as part of our transformation initiative. As you know, we’ve made significant progress. You see it again in Q1 with margin expansion. So we will look there first on how we can accelerate further margin and cost opportunities. Point number two is, yes, we will work with all of our stakeholders.

That includes our vendors. It includes our customers as we assess and look at what opportunities we have. As it relates to our vendors, we’ve got long, deep relationships with many suppliers around the world. We source from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that we source into The US. I’ll speak to some of the countries in a moment.

So that is definitely an area that we’re investigating. But we’re in the very early days on that, Laurent, so I’d say more to follow. And then similarly, on pricing, as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it’ll be very surgical. As you saw even this past quarter, our average unit retail, their AURs were up again.

So the consumer is actually increasing prices. They buy up into more premium products. So that’s an opportunity. We’ve also been pulling back, especially in our DTC channel and some promotion. We had more full price selling.

So that whole area is an opportunity. So I would just say more to come. But really, we’re looking at those three areas, The cost structure, kind of the end to end stakeholder and supply chain, and then surgical pricing. And then specific to the supply chain, as I said, we have a global long tenured supply chain. We source from over 28 countries.

The places that we source from are the places you’d expect from the industry. Some of the key countries for us, in no particular order, are places like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam. Those, I’d say, are our top vendors. But it’s broad. And I’d say our supply chain is more agile today than it ever has been.

We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium, and long term.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And I think what we’ve disclosed, Laurent, into The US from China approximately 1%, into The US, from Mexico approximately 5%, and from Vietnam in the mid to high single digits into The US.

Unidentified Speaker: Very helpful. Thank you very much for your thoughts.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead, Dana.

Dana Telsey, Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group: Hi, everyone. Nice to see the progress. As you think about inventory levels, Harmit, how you planning inventory levels going forward on wholesale orders? What are you seeing from the account? And Michelle, given the Beyonce campaign and some of the other activations and collaboration, women’s business, men’s business, how you thinking of the denim market growing?

And what should we be looking at given the linen and denim and new things coming and how you’re thinking about pricing? Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Dana, a couple of things. Inventory at the end of q one was The composition of the inventory is healthy. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for The US, we have product for spring and summer. And so that’s why, you know, we gave a guidance on quarter two.

The other thing is our quarter two includes March, and the the the trends in March are stronger than how we exited the, you know, February. So that’s that’s a perspective on that business. We’re being prudent in inventory planning. You know, as we think about the year, you know, as you think about inventory, the three things, and now the fourth that we’re keeping in mind, there was getting product in for spring and summer largely because the tariff clouds were you know, there was an overhang even a couple of months ago. The second for Europe is Red Sea disruption, and and and and the and the third was generally, you know, our thinking about about the year.

So being very prudent. As a reminder for everybody, we sell a lot of coal. Right? So a lot of our product is seasonless, and we can carry it through seasons. And our balance sheet is fairly strong.

We talked about the cash position at the end of the quarter and the access to liquidity. So we are in a good spot in a lot of ways, but we’re being prudent. To your question about wholesale orders, global wholesale was up 5%. US wholesale was up nine organically. This was the second quarter where we have seen both global wholesale and US wholesale up.

And, you know, so as we think and as we’ll as we are understanding right now, there’s been no change to there’s been no change to orders in from wholesale customers. Inventory or trade inventory is, you know, very similar to 2019 levels. Just now let me share a little bit of a perspective on wholesale in Europe. Wholesale in Europe was down in quarter one. Essentially, as I said, because we are ramping up our distribution center, we expect wholesale to return to growth in quarter two.

The indicate best indication of wholesale demand in Europe is prebook, which for spring and summer is positive, and for fall is positive right now. And I think the second question, Michelle, she asked you about the denim category.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. So, Dana, thanks for the question. And I think to echo what we said in remarks, we’re really pleased with the start of the year, and the Levi’s brand has never been stronger. So Levi’s brand was at 8% in the quarter. And I think to your question, we’re seeing gains in both men and women, both in market share and in equity.

So specific to the Beyonce campaign, 4,300,000,000 press impressions, more than 65,000,000 in media value alone. But I think importantly, it’s creating a nice tailwind to everything else that we’re doing. Specific to, as we think about our transformation, we must preserve and drive the leadership position in men’s. But our intention has been to accelerate with women’s because we’re under shared there. Women’s is now 38% of our business.

Q1 was our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Like I said, we are now firmly in the number one position market share in The US, and we’re growing that, which is really exciting. Women’s was up 12% overall across all channels and geographies. And then if you look at DTC, which is really the leading indicator, up 16% in the quarter and really delivering on that head to toe lifestyle. So as we pivot from jeans to becoming DTC, becoming head to toe, we’re seeing that in our DTC results, up 12%, and we’re seeing that in women’s and in lifestyle.

So like I said, women’s up 16 and both bottoms and tops growing. The team is really nailing it in terms of driving trends and fashion fit. Diversifying the fit opportunity to strengthen loose and baggy continues, but our core remains strong. Western wear continues to trend. The list goes on.

But even in times like these, when it’s turbulent, we’re going to lean in and please our fans with delivering the highest quality product. It’s a great value and deliver that innovation. Thank you. Thanks, Dana.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead,

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Matt. Thank you.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: So Michelle, could you elaborate on key drivers of the 9% organic growth, maybe consumer demand and market share trends that you’re seeing in The Americas? And Harmit, if you could maybe speak to the cadence of gross margin in the second quarter relative to the back half?

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Sure. Great. So I can start. I mean, one of the things, Matt, that we’re really proud of the team’s efforts this quarter is really across the board, we saw strength. So if you take our geographies as an example, so our total organic revenue is up nine percent.

We saw strength in The Americas, in Europe, and in Asia, and beyond yoga, I would say, as well, as that carries forward another quarter of double digit growth. The channels both channels were positive. DTC up 12. 12 quarter of positive growth, can speak to that in a moment, as well as our wholesale business up 5%. And I’d say it’s particular strength in US wholesale.

And then if I really double click under DTC, because the 9%, clearly the 12% is what’s fueling the majority of that. It’s now 52% of our business. As you know, our long term goal that we’ve put out there is to be at least 55%, so we’re making great progress. But if you think about DTC and look at some of the the KPIs, the key metrics there, as it relates to our owned and operated stores, positive comp sales. We saw positive traffic.

We saw positive conversion, and we saw positive AURs. E commerce up 16%, again, positive traffic, conversion, and AURs. And so when you think about this, the growth is healthy and it’s sustainable. We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about twothree of the business, and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up onethree. So this, as we look at the trends, feel like it’s sustainable.

And it’s all coming off of the back of our key strategies. When we say DTC first, denim lifestyle, winning with women, we’re seeing that across the board. And then your second part of your question was around market share. And as I think I mentioned even in my earlier remarks, we’re really pleased to see the growth we are seeing there. Both men’s and women’s grew market share in The US this past quarter, number one in both positions across both genders.

And the other piece that we’re seeing nice momentum and growth is growing market share with youth, that eighteen to thirty year old target customer, as well as the premium consumer. So there’s just there’s just, a lot to like and a lot of momentum we’re seeing across all of our segments of the business.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And, Matt, to your question of gross margin, which to me is a great indicator of how the brand’s doing, record gross margins in quarter one at 62.1. I think the best way to think about it is half is driven by product costs, which are not truly just straight vendor negotiation. As part of our transformation efforts, we’ll you know, we’re taking a hard look at SKUs. We have reduced our SKUs. You know, we’re taking a hard look at assortments that are not as productive, as well as our newer innovations are great margins.

So that’s one piece of it. And the other half, I would say, is a combination of mix, which is higher women’s, higher DTC, higher international, higher full price selling that Michelle referred to. There’s a there’s a real focus given that our products are hitting home. We drive higher full price selling, and we had favorable effects given our, you know, hedging strategy. Similar in for q q two.

So q two reflected margins would be up 80 to a hundred basis points, again, driven by this. And on a full year basis, a hundred basis points. To your question about cadence, first half versus second half, the first half is really strong. The second half, because our margin structure was very strong a year ago, the second half will be muted. Still up, but, you know, much lower than the first half.

And, you know, obviously, we are focused on driving more full price selling. It’s something that is difficult to predict. That’s why, you know, we continue to beat margins. I mean and the other reason that’s driving higher margin is the wonderful DTC business is higher gross margin.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great color. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Matt.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead, Jay.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just on the guidance for Q2, can you give us a sense of for that organic net revenue growth, how you see that by region?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So, similar, Jay, I would say, you know, The US low to mid single digit, as you think about, you know, q two. Europe, probably mid single digit with one difference. Wholesale should return to growth given what I indicated in Asia. Again, mid single digit.

If you think of channels, BDC, you know, I would say high single digit. And global wholesale, flat to slightly up is the general thinking at this stage.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Got it. Alright. Great. Thank you so much.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Jay.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Ike.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Harmit, I think two for you. Just can you walk us through the expense deleverage that looks to be implied in the 2Q after getting some pretty good leverage in 1Q? And then it looks like the back half should go back to kind of getting nice leverage to flat.

Just what exactly are the spending dynamics kind of taking place in the second quarter? And then bigger picture for you, it sounds like there’s no revenue issues for the business at all right now. But at least over the past couple of weeks, it might be helpful. Could you talk about the brand overseas? I think there’s some growing narrative about anti American response to US brands that there is a risk to what’s going on geopolitically.

Would love to hear if you’re seeing any of that or if there’s any noteworthy developments that you’ve come across in the past couple of weeks. Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Right. So I’ll Ike, I’ll I’ll try and do this in a speed round. Right now, international business is fairly strong. We are not seeing any any impact internationally. From our perspective, you know, we’ve been here for a long, long time.

Internationally, you know, as a business, we’ve been around for, you know, over eighty years. So we’re not seeing it. You know, we’re in friends with the local consumers, connecting really well. And our new product offers that Michelle referred to are generally doing well. To your question about the quarter two guidance, so quarter two, just as a reminder, is largely, you know, is our lowest volume quarter just from the seasonality.

First quarter has December holiday. Third quarter has back to school, and the fourth quarter has the beginning of holidays. The second quarter, So seasonally, it’s the lowest quarter. In terms of SG and A increase, the first quarter was up two. We expect the second quarter to be up three.

SG and and A as a rate is in the mid fifties. It was around under 50. We still expect SG and A for the year to be around 50%, and this is prior to any actions that we take, as Michelle referred to, you know, to mitigate actions on tariff, etcetera. And the EPS decline relative to last year is primarily driven by foreign exchange and higher tax. You know, even though foreign exchange rates have improved a little from the last quarter, they’re very volatile.

They go up and down. And so our perspective is FX and higher tax will probably impact EPS adversely by about 3, you know, 3¢. But structurally, the business is in good standing. You know, gross margins, you know, we expect to be up, and organic rate to be up three and a half, 4%. You know, think of our reported revenue reported revenue in quarter two, I said it’s flat to slightly up.

And so that’s what the deleverage in terms of EBIT percentage.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Harmit is saying is just when you think about the whole year, know, we’re we’re obviously thinking about our strategy is to drive the top line. We’ll get some leverage there and drive margin expansion, both in gross margin over the year and in EBIT margin. And as you know, we saw progress from 2024 over 2023, and we’ve guided the year to see another level of expansion there as well. All this, of course, does not yet reflect the tariffs.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Ike.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Nardone of BofA. Please go ahead,

Chris Nardone, Analyst, BofA: Great, guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow ups. First on U. S.

Wholesale, can you just clarify whether your guidance is implying positive or negative growth for the remainder of this year? And then looking out, it sounds like you benefited from expanding into some newer wholesale distribution points in the first quarter. How big is this opportunity over the medium term? And do you need growth in U. S.

Wholesale to reach your medium term EBIT margin targets?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: So Chris, we’ve had two great quarters in wholesale. US and the team, big shout out to them. They’ve delivered US wholesale growth in the first two quarters. I indicated, I think, in the earlier question, q two globally, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly up. Our expectation in US wholesale right now, we continue to be prudent, and so we think, you know, a flat number is a good number at this stage.

Obviously, we’re another quarter under the belt. We’ll we’ll talk about the the full year from that perspective. On the distribution, you are right. You know, our opportunities on distribution in The US is primarily around the categories we are growing DDC. We think we have an opportunity in women’s.

We think we we have an opportunity in tops. And as you know, you know, after the exit of Denizen and Target, we are working with our customers, in this case, Target, to try and grow our Levi’s business, and that’s making a difference. So as we think about opportunities of distribution and wholesale, there are opportunities around the company, especially as we grow the categories and, you know, both gender, women and men’s, as Michelle referred to, and the different categories as a pivot to a denim lifestyle company.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead,

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hi, thanks. Michelle and Harmit, in the past, what are your thoughts around frameworks around pricing? And also, when you look at tariffs in the past, what percentage did you absorb versus share with customers in different ways? As we look forward, if you pricing has been something that you’ve adjusted in the past and recently in terms of being prices being too high. So would you take lower margins in terms of offering the consumer a good value?

I know there’s a very dynamic situation here with tariffs and inflation.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Oliver, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. I mean, think the word you just said is very appropriate, which is it is very dynamic right now. I mean, we’re literally this this whole situation is just a couple of days old, as you know, and I think both Harmeet and I mentioned we’ve got a really talented team right now who’s dissecting the problem and looking at all the levers that we have to address the issue, two of which you just hit on, which is we will work with our vendors, with our customers to understand the best way forward.

And then pricing is a potential lever. Would say as we think about it, we will very much think about any pricing if we do take pricing very surgically. Number one, one of the things we’ve seen our consumer do is they’re actually driving price up. We saw our AURs again this quarter increase as they gravitate to more premium products. So we expect that to continue.

There could be more pricing power in our more premium products. So we’ll look at that. Promotions. We have been surgically pulling back more in DTC, I would say, on promotions and achieving more full price selling. So that is something that

We can test pricing in our DTC channel. That’s something that we can more easily do and understand the elasticity. We have recent experience, for example, in Mexico where we successfully took some price adjustments based on the tariffs there. And then what I would say overall as we think about the Levi’s brand, we address today a broad range of price points. If you start at the core of our product, we’re at a very accessible price point in that $40.50 dollars range.

Then we do compete in the value segment with signature. It’s largely offered in some of the mass channels. That’s doing really well. We were up 19% this quarter. And then we go high end, the way from, I’ll call it, our tier two, which is in our mainline stores.

You’re seeing more and more on that of ecom. That’s where we’re in the $90.100 dollars range. And then even upwards of $200.300 dollars with Tier one and our new Blue Cab. So I share that in the spirit of we have a lot to work with here to determine what is going to be our right path forward. But it’s gonna be really important for us to be super sensitive to the consumer and make sure that we’re on the right path.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. And Harmine, can you get inventory faster, like, now in order to address what’s happening? Or what happened with the inventory you have on hand relative to the win and the the methodology for inventory valuation that we should know about with timing of prices relative to the cost of goods sold?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. I mean, Oliver, we’re looking at all options right now. You know, I’m sure a lot of our partners and vendors are being called, you know, and so we’re looking at options. We’ve been able to successfully air freight, you know, in the past when we were chasing product. The fact that we have inventory for spring and summer is a good indication.

We’re also working on a faster go to market calendar, especially for the newer products. So, you know, we’re doing everything that we can within our means. And to your question about, you know, cost accounting and, you know, depending on where tariffs it totally depends where tariffs settle. It’s such a fluid situation, and so we’re working through it.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. Thanks. Best regards.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Oliver.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead, Paul.

Unidentified Speaker: Hey, thanks guys. Can you tell you’re thinking about the various macro backdrops of the major regions that you operate in and also how you’re looking at the competitive landscape currently? You’re seeing any changes in terms of promotions, either increasing or decreasing, and just, you know, sort of what is the the backdrop that that you’re you’re thinking about by by your major regions? Thanks.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So the good news, Paul, is, you know, q one is a good indication of the momentum of the brand. The growth was broad based. All regions were up. You know, Europe was up only three, but on an organic basis, because that was driven by the ramp up in our distribution center.

And so as we think across the world, you know, Europe, Third consecutive quarter of growth. US, Fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Mexico, Second consecutive quarter of growth. Asia, up, you know, double digits. So, generally, the momentum is strong from that perspective.

Being global and 60% international, I think, will make a difference, at least from that perspective. Consumer, generally resilient across the world. They’re responding to our new products. You know, our products offer great value, as Michelle referenced. So we’re feeling generally good from that perspective.

Unidentified Speaker: Any changes on the promotional front? That

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you Yeah. And promotions, actually, we are tightening promotions. I mean, that’s why the focus on full price sales, you can see it in margins. So we’re not necessarily going the other way at this stage because the consumer is not giving us giving us a reason for a change. And because inventories are generally in a good spot, there’s no reason to push that down faster, push price down faster.

Unidentified Speaker: Great. Thanks, Henry. Good luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Paul.

Conference Operator: Comes from Brook Roach.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about your playbook should the macro environment worsen. What’s the cost structure of your business today? How much is fixed versus variable? And how much additional SG and A leverage can you drive this year to offset higher product costs if the macro environment worsens materially?

Unidentified Speaker: Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: It’s all it’s all being planned right now, Brooke. I think the best best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is is 2020 and ’21, which is which was COVID. At that point, our view was, you know, fixed and variable. You know, I’d say between sixty five and seventy fixed, the rest variable. You know?

And variable, I’d also add incentives available, for example. But, you know, it’s the last thing you want to touch, especially when there’s so much momentum in the brand, I’ll put it there. I think as you think about our stores, very similar cost structure, but even then, we actually grew our store base. You know, we kept adding stores. And so, you know, we’re thinking through it.

We’re putting everything on the table right now as we think through the three levers, which is, you know, cost initiatives without compromising the long term, stakeholder management discussions, which is customers and our vendor partners, and the third is pricing, you know, options and initiatives. And so we are looking at all options, Brooke. And then we have an international business that’s very strong. Right? That could also be you know, we can drive some momentum there to offset some softness, if any, in The US.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you. Thank you, Brooke.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

""WPG is providing support including a severance package, access to outplacement services including job search assistance, resume workshops, professional headshots, and a development program was launched last summer to help colleagues learn new skills and obtain certifications and degrees to help them prepare for their next chapter after WPG.""

Like other shopping center owners, WPG was crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which dramatically reduced mall traffic and revenue.

After filing for bankruptcy protection in June 2021, WPG announced that it would no longer be publicly traded. Instead, the company emerged from bankruptcy five months later, in November 2021, as a private firm controlled by SVPGlobal, a private investment group based in Connecticut.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/07/NCOD/82979861007-img-polaris-entrancejpg-1-1-9-s-1440-o-4-q-l-2050879313.JPG?crop=5999,3375,x0,y313&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-07 19:05:56.620669

The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements.
But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook.
But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this.
Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history.","Let's take a look at what's trending after hours. We want to talk about Levi's, the denim company. Those shares are moving higher after it delivered a beat on first quarter earnings. The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements. So that's really important here, um, that I I want to emphasize here. The company's saying in a statement, Harmit Singh, who is the chief financial and growth officer, says, we're maintaining our forecast, which seems like a good thing. But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook. Um, Kenny Polcari, you are still with me here, and I have been I've been looking very closely at companies like this, because obviously Levi's sources a lot of its stuff from outside the US and is subject to tariffs. So you see a statement like this, and at first you say, oh, they're maintaining. That's a good thing. We're excluding all tariffs, though. Is that just because they can't

Well quantify it at this time. if they can't quantify it, but that then leaves open the door, while it sounds positive. They said they've just said we're excluding the tariffs, suggesting we can't quantify it, so we may have more negative news down the line. But the market is not taking it that way. I mean it's up a little bit. What's it up, 2% in the after hours, um, although it is down 34% in the last year. So maybe there's a little bit of a push to, but it's going to be interesting to see if there's any other further clarification, if someone starts calling them out asking them for you know, for more clarification.

It feels that way. Yeah. Right. Yes. Well, I mean, the conference calls is going to be real interesting in that regard. I am sure that analysts are going to push them on a potential tariff effect. But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this. We're going to get um forecasts from many of them, or Right.

We won't get any. Right.

We won't get any, because they say we just don't know. What is the and what is the tariff going to be? I have no idea. Right.

And I think if you have a lot of them that say they're not going to forecast or they can't tell, that's going to be a negative, right? People are going to take it as a negative, because they're going to lose they're going to lose the guidance. They're not going to know which way to go. So that would, in my mind, it would cause uh it would cause the market to become weaker, or at least their stock to become weaker. Um, but then if we keep hearing that with more and more companies, then you know, it'll have a more broader effect.

You said this, though. Yeah. Yes, exactly. You know, we've been asking a lot of people today what they're expecting for earning season. We didn't have a chance to ask you, so.

So I so I think already, listen, I think that when we came into the year, it was supposed to be 12% year-over-year growth. I think that's been whittled back down to 7%. We've seen, you know, uh as they as they modify coming into the end of the quarter. Uh so I think that's I think I'm comfortable saying that I think that's about what it's going to be. And to Keith's point, where he said you're going to see probably a 70% B grade, which is kind of It's the game that they all play. Yes. the number, right? Right. So they they lower the numbers and then they beat it. They go, oh, look, we beat it. I got it, great. Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history. When they report their history It's history. It is really about what they say going forward, and this quarter is going to be very important about what they say going forward.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UjNpulZk93jf4INRqhsn0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/81221d90-13f4-11f0-bf7f-e67618f85d32,N,,2025-04-07 19:05:44.936909

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate.
Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.
Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.
“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale.","Momentum has got to count for something — in sports and fashion.

“We had a strong quarter,” said Michelle Gass, president and chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co., in an interview on first-quarter results. “[Organic] sales up 9 percent kicks off 2025 in a very strong way. But not only sales, our margins were up. It’s another proof point that our transformation is working.”

But this is also one of those moments when the past has a lighter grip on the present and the future is all the more uncertain.

U.S. President Donald Trump moved on from sniping at China to launching a global trade war last week, adding on 10 percent tariffs on goods from nearly every other country. And some have been hit with much higher rates including China, which is being hit with an additional 34 percent tariff.

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate. “We — and the entire industry — are facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty at this moment.”

In addition to some momentum, Levi’s has been cutting costs as it moves to a stronger direct-to-consumer stance and is also cushioned by its international business, which accounts for 60 percent of sales.

Levi’s sources from 28 countries, including China (which accounts for only 1 percent of product), Mexico (5 percent) and Vietnam (a single-digit percentage). The rest of Levi’s goods come mostly from other countries in Asia.

But there’s really no global supply chain in fashion that could skirt Trump’s tariffs.

Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.

“We’ve already been on the path to improve the structural economics of the business,” said Gass, referring to work that has seen Levi’s cut costs over the past year or so. “We will look to accelerate that and then we will work with all of our partners. And if we do take pricing, we’re going to do that very surgically. No decisions have been made.”

The speed of events on the ground — Trump, for instance, threatened China with another 50 percent tariff on Monday — makes it hard to settle on any decision.

So for now Levi’s, like the rest of fashion, is planning and watching the market closely.

First-quarter sales rose 3 percent to $1.5 billion, but were up 9 percent on an organic basis, which excludes currency fluctuations, the closed footwear and Denizen businesses and the Dockers business, which is now classified as a discontinued operation.

Net income tallied $135 million, or 34 cents a share, up from losses of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi’s ended the quarter with $574 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer, called that “a very good spot” to be in.

The company is holding Dockers for sale and was said to be in exclusive talks with brand management firm Marquee Brands. But sources said that period of exclusivity expired just as the market hit its tariff crisis, making it difficult to value the brand in the current environment.

“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale. “There are a couple of prospective buyers. We are in the middle of the sale process and it is confidential right now.”

He said the company was confident that a deal would close “sometime in 2025.”

If the uncertainty in the market has complicated the Dockers sale, Gass said Levi’s mission was still clear despite a volatile world.

“There is uncertainty at times like these,” the CEO said. “Levi’s is the type of brand that people will go to. They are going to go to brands that they trust, and we stand for the things that are really important in uncertain times, which is quality, value, taking care of our consumer. We’re going to continue to focus on great execution and operate against our playbook. That playbook is working.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michelle_Gass_Levis.jpg?crop=0px%2C726px%2C1997px%2C1119px&resize=1000%2C563,N,,2025-04-07 18:10:54.948675

CEO notes 'uncertain environment' but touts an 'agile supply chain'

Levi Strauss & Co. on Monday reported a higher adjusted quarterly profit than Wall Street expected, and the denim and jeans maker said it was sticking with its full-year outlook - one that doesn't include the potential impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The company said it still expects a sales drop of 1% to 2% for its fiscal year, which is set to run through November, with adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 a share. That forecast, Levi's (LEVI) said, excluded any hit from ""the recent tariff announcements."" But it said it expected ""minimal impact"" to its margin expectations for the second quarter.

Levi's reported fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.53 billion, up 3% year over year. It reported adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected Levi Strauss to report adjusted earnings of 28 cents a share for its first quarter, which ended on March 2. They expected sales of $1.54 billion.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement.

Shares rose 3.1% after hours.

The financials included in Levi's earnings release excluded $67 million in sales related to Dockers, which the company now considers ""discontinued operations.""

The company has been trying to sell its Dockers business, amid efforts to lower costs and focus more on newer jeans and other denim items. Levi's has tried to retain inflation-fatigued consumers' interest with a partnership with Beyoncé.

Levi's reported the results as new tariffs announced last week by Trump continue to roil markets. Meanwhile, jeans could be targeted for steeper trade retaliation by the European Union.

Morningstar analyst David Swartz, in a note last week, said Trump's tariffs had ""significant implications"" for clothing makers. He noted that nearly all the clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mainly from Asia.

Levi's, in its most recent annual report, said that in its last fiscal year, it got its products from manufacturers in nearly 30 nations. No more than 30% came from any one country, that report said. The company said it sourced products from North and South Asia, the Americas, including the United States, as well as Europe and Africa. And it said that of the items it sells in the U.S., ""less than 1% are directly sourced and manufactured in China.""

Even before Trump's announcement, Levi's had forecast falling sales for its fiscal year. In January, management said ""there continues to be a lot of uncertainty related to the macro environment, potential tariffs, changes in the tax code, as well as worsening foreign exchange.""

The stock is down some 34% over the past 12 months.

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike NKE to Target TGT.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty — which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8% last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

It posted a 3% rise in revenue from continuing operations to $1.53 billion, which excluded sales from its Dockers brand, now reclassified as a discontinued operation.

Analysts, on average, were expecting a 1% drop in revenue to $1.54 billion, as per data compiled by LSEG, including Dockers.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 18:11:05.681096

Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 basis points to 13.4% from 9.4% last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% from 58.8% in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favorable channel and brand mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7% to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7% compared to 49.4% last year.

Restructuring charges were $7 million related to Project Fuel.

Interest and other expenses, net, which include foreign exchange losses, were $15 million in the aggregate compared to $12 million in Q1 2024.

The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, compared to 15.9% in Q1 2024.

Net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted net income was $150 million compared to $100 million in Q1 2024.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.35 compared to diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.03 in Q1 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.38 compared to $0.25 in Q1 2024.

Additional information regarding Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted free cash flow as well as amounts presented on an organic net revenues basis and constant-currency basis, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release.

Balance Sheet Review as of March 2, 2025

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Words such as, but not limited to, ""believe,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""so we can,"" ""when,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""could"" and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider the information contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024 especially in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"", ""Summary of Risk Factors"" and ""Risk Factors"" sections and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 2, 2025, especially in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"", section.

In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release and related conference call may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this press release and related conference call.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See ""RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES"" below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Levi Strauss said fiscal first-quarter revenue rose, boosted by the U.S. market, and kept its outlook for the year unchanged but excluded the impact of higher tariffs from its guidance.

The apparel retailer on Monday swung to a profit for the three months ended March 2 of $135 million, or 34 cents a share, from a loss of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.

Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings per-share came in at 38 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 28 cents.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million of revenue from Dockers after being reclassified as a discontinued brand, and boosted by a 6% increase across its core Americas region. Overall, direct-to-consumer revenue increased 9%, while wholesale fell 3%. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast total revenue of $1.54 billion.

In the U.S., revenue rose 8% on an organic basis after logging high-single digit growth in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses.

The company kept its outlook for fiscal 2025 unchanged, excluding the impact from President Trump's latest round of tariffs, but said it expects a minimal impact to its second-quarter outlook.

Levi's guidance also doesn't assume any significant worsening macro-economic pressure on the consumer.

The company expects a drop in full-year revenue of 1% to 2%, and adjusted earnings between $1.20 to $1.25.

(NYSE: LEVI) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 2, 2025. The following information is based on continuing operations which excludes approximately $67 million of net revenues related to Dockers®.

“We exceeded revenue and profitability expectations in Q1 marking a strong start to the year, another proof point that our transformation strategy is working,” said Michelle Gass, President and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. “The Levi’s® brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the center of culture across the globe. While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond.”

“We delivered significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter, and the strong momentum continued through March,” said Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co.“Looking forward, we are maintaining our 2025 top- and bottom-line guidance, which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements, and we anticipate minimal impact to our Q2 margin outlook. In addition, our strong balance sheet, improved structural economics and the underlying strength of our business all give us confidence in our path forward.”

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers® business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. During the first quarter of 2025, we commenced a sale process of the Dockers® business with the target of completing a transaction in fiscal year 2025. As of March 2, 2025, we determined the Dockers® business met held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. The supplemental table below includes our 2024 results recast for continuing and discontinued operations.

Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.01%.
Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for USB’s quarterly earnings has been revised 2.1% upward to 99 cents.","The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK is scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 11, before market open. The company’s quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis.

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.

In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily aided by a rise in fee revenues and net interest income (NII) alongside lower provisions and non-interest expenses. Also, higher assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management balances were positives.

BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 8.01%.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote

The consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. This indicates a rise of 15.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.73 billion, implying 4.5% growth.

Factors to Impact BNY Mellon’s Q1 Results

Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fees (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $2.37 billion.

The consensus mark for financing-related fees stands at $54.7 million, which suggests a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $54.3 million.

The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $39 million, implying a 7.1% decline. Our estimate for the same is $41.6 million.

In the first quarter, foreign exchange (FX) trading activity was driven by heightened market volatility and increased hedging demand amid global economic uncertainties. Further, higher-for-longer interest rates and concerns regarding a potential trade war, given Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened the dollar. Thus, increased FX trading volumes are likely to have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s FX revenues, partially offset by a weak dollar performance. The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues stands at $181.8 million, suggesting a jump of 19.6%. Our estimate for the same is $176.5 million.

The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is $3.44 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.1%. We project the metric to be $3.60 billion.

NII: The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during the first quarter of 2025 amid sticky inflation concerns. This is likely to have positively impacted BK’s NII during the first quarter, given relatively higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs.

Further, the yield curve steepened during the quarter due to economic uncertainties, which is likely to have offered further support for reinvestment yields.

However, a cautious stance regarding future rate cuts by the Fed and a tough operating backdrop is likely to have subdued the overall lending scenario to some extent. Per the latest Fed data, overall loan demand improved in the first two months of the quarter.

The consensus mark for NII is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an 8.1% year-over-year rise. We expect NII to be $1.08 billion.

Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges and buyouts, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. In the first quarter, overall costs are expected to increase, driven by inflationary pressure, technology upgrades and a multi-year transformation plan.

Our estimate for non-interest expenses is $3.38 billion, suggesting a 6.3% year-over-year rise.

What the Zacks Model Unveils for BNY Mellon

According to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.

Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.01%.

Other Bank Stocks That Warrant a Look

A couple of bank stocks that also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases are U.S. Bancorp USB and State Street Corporation STT.

USB has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and it carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 16. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for USB’s quarterly earnings has been revised 2.1% upward to 99 cents.

In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote

The consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. This indicates a rise of 15.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.73 billion, implying 4.5% growth.

Factors to Impact BNY Mellon’s Q1 Results

Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fees (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $2.37 billion.

The consensus mark for financing-related fees stands at $54.7 million, which suggests a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $54.3 million.

The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $39 million, implying a 7.1% decline. Our estimate for the same is $41.6 million.

In the first quarter, foreign exchange (FX) trading activity was driven by heightened market volatility and increased hedging demand amid global economic uncertainties. Further, higher-for-longer interest rates and concerns regarding a potential trade war, given Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened the dollar. Thus, increased FX trading volumes are likely to have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s FX revenues, partially offset by a weak dollar performance. The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues stands at $181.8 million, suggesting a jump of 19.6%. Our estimate for the same is $176.5 million.

The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is $3.44 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.1%. We project the metric to be $3.60 billion.

NII: The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during the first quarter of 2025 amid sticky inflation concerns. This is likely to have positively impacted BK’s NII during the first quarter, given relatively higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs.

Further, the yield curve steepened during the quarter due to economic uncertainties, which is likely to have offered further support for reinvestment yields.

However, a cautious stance regarding future rate cuts by the Fed and a tough operating backdrop is likely to have subdued the overall lending scenario to some extent. Per the latest Fed data, overall loan demand improved in the first two months of the quarter.

The consensus mark for NII is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an 8.1% year-over-year rise. We expect NII to be $1.08 billion.

Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges and buyouts, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. In the first quarter, overall costs are expected to increase, driven by inflationary pressure, technology upgrades and a multi-year transformation plan.

Our estimate for non-interest expenses is $3.38 billion, suggesting a 6.3% year-over-year rise.

While President Donald Trump's tariffs will not have much direct impact on eateries, another pullback in consumer spending would hurt restaurants.

Fast-food chains have historically fared the best during economic downturns.

Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 2%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Money Report

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped less than 1% and 2%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell 1% and shares of Wingstop sank less than 1%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.",https://media.nbcdfw.com/2025/04/108106608-17404258302025-02-24t185956z_1297819252_rc261dagdmju_rtrmadp_0_starbucks-layoffs.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-04-07 17:08:50.964434

Dive Brief:

Visits to coffee chains of all sizes are up by 29% over the past five years, according to Placer.ai data. Small and medium-sized coffee brands have seen a disproportionate benefit, however, while industry titans like Starbucks and Dunkin’ lagged.

Small chain’s visit share rose from 3.2% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2024, while medium-sized brands, like BIGGBY Coffee and Dutch Bros, saw visit share grow from 10.8% to 17.6% in the same time.

Starbucks and Dunkin’s combined share of coffee visits remains vast — 77.9% according to Placer.ai — and visits have increased in absolute terms. But the erosion of visit share could signal vulnerability for coffee category leaders.

Dive Insight:

Consumer behavior at stores, rather than simple visit data, also sheds light on shifts in coffee’s competitive landscape.

Visits lasting longer than 10 minutes increased 13.4% at small coffee chains from 2023 to 2024, and fell at Dunkin and Starbucks by 8.9%, according to Placer.ai’s data. Short visits and long visits increased at medium-sized brands.

“Smaller coffee shops are increasingly filling the niche of a relaxed, destination-oriented experience,” Bracha Arnold, a content writer for Placer.ai, wrote in a post analyzing the data.

This consumer shift toward smaller and medium-sized chains as coffee-oriented “third places” could help explain why Starbucks, after years of emphasis on speed and throughput, is returning its focus to in-store experience under CEO Brian Niccol. That move may be necessary to preserve the brand’s position in the market from competition from smaller, more local-feeling coffee shops.

“These shifts highlight the different needs that coffee shops can fill within a community, with some offering speed and convenience, while others can meet the desire for a relaxed and personalized coffee experience,” Arnold wrote in the report.

Arnold noted that coffee traffic growth slowed in late 2024, which could signal a plateau in consumer demand.

One of the many complaints and reasons for this decline is consumers' dislike of Starbucks' prices, which tend to be higher than those of most coffee shops and have risen over the years due to inflation and extra charges for customizations.

Since taking over as Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol has emphasized the need to bring the company back to its roots by focusing on its core products, personalizing the coffee shop experience like it once did, and keeping prices from increasing.

""I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,"" said Niccol in an earnings call.

Starbucks' turnaround plan is threatened by tariffs

To return the business to growth, Starbucks (SBUX) developed a turnaround strategy that aims to improve customers' overall experience by redesigning stores, optimizing efficiency, prioritizing coffee quality, simplifying its menu, and keeping prices from elevating in 2025.

Starbucks has tried to freeze prices by eliminating extra charges for milk alternatives, reducing customization options, discontinuing menu items, and providing free refills for those who consume in stores.

However, President Donald Trump's new tariffs could make Starbucks' goal of price-freezing without risking further profit losses even more challenging.

President Trump announced in February that he would implement a 25% additional tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, a 10% tariff on China, and a 10% levy.

However, on Apr. 2, President Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices created a national emergency. He implemented new tariffs on products imported into the U.S. from many countries, including an additional 10% baseline tariff.

President Trump claims that these newly imposed tariffs aim to combat this concern by encouraging the production and purchasing of American-based products, which will increase competitive edge, protect sovereignty, and strengthen national and economic security.

Starbucks' main product faces challenges amid tariff implementations

Although Starbucks is an American company, most of its coffee is imported from over 30 different countries worldwide. Since more than 70 countries are coffee producers, only around 1% of all coffee consumed in the U.S. is made within the country.

Starbucks sources coffee from the three main regions that produce it: Latin America, Africa, and Asia/Pacific. Asia is one of the regions with the highest tariffs, and Vietnam is one of Starbucks' top suppliers, now facing a 46% tariff on goods imported into the U.S.

Many companies from all sectors are concerned about the negative financial repercussions the implementation of these tariffs could have on their businesses since some are highly dependent on imported goods from these select countries, including Starbucks, whose coffee beans make up around 10% to 15% of its production and distribution costs.

Starbucks stated that its year-over-year coffee price impact was minimal during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 in its latest earnings call, expressing confidence in its pricing strategy.

The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care.","Simply better health.

Dear fellow stockholders:

We help 185 million Americans live their healthiest lives possible. It is a privilege to lead CVS Health®, and more importantly, to work with our more than 300,000 colleagues to deliver simply better health.

Our job has never been more important: improve the well-being of individuals across the country by making health care more accessible, simple and aﬀordable. Our unmatched combination of businesses and extensive consumer reach uniquely position CVS Health to help deﬁne the future of health care.

I am honored to have been appointed president and chief executive oﬃcer in October 2024. In many roles throughout my 39 years in our industry, I've had none more meaningful than the one I have now, supporting our colleagues as they work to improve the health of millions of people.

The health care industry is challenging and complex, but our commitment to care never wavers. From ensuring a child had access to their anti-seizure medication during a hurricane, to supporting a member through a complex transplant surgery so they could attend their son's wedding… we are there for the moments that matter most. Each of our businesses plays a critical role in achieving our mission and supporting the health of Americans. Every day, we are working hard to become America's leading and most trusted health care company.

In 2024, we generated $372.8 billion in revenue and delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.66 with adjusted earnings per share of $5.42.* Despite the challenges last year, particularly in our Aetna® business, we advanced our strategy and achieved signiﬁcant milestones.

Health Care Beneﬁts

We took decisive actions to address the long-term sustainability of our Aetna business, including product design updates that support a strong, multi-year recovery, while oﬀering members the beneﬁts that matter most. We appointed new leadership at Aetna, including a new president, chief operating oﬃcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, and strengthened business processes to drive improved ﬁnancial performance, while increasing transparency and accountability.

Our Medicare Advantage Stars capabilities represent a strength of the Aetna business. In 2024, Aetna achieved exceptional Star Ratings with 88 percent of our Medicare Advantage members in plans rated at least 4 Stars, and more than two-thirds of members in plans rated at least 4.5 Stars. In addition, our commitment to outstanding service resulted in our highest-ever member experience score since the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched the Quality Bonus Stars Program in 2012.

Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness

CVS Pharmacy® is America's leading pharmacy. Our focus on consumer engagement, colleague experience and operational excellence enabled us to achieve a record retail pharmacy script share in 2024. We also continue to lead the shift to a more sustainable and transparent pharmacy market with the implementation of CVS CostVantage™.

We converted all commercial prescriptions dispensed through CVS Pharmacy to this innovative economic model as of January 1, 2025. CVS CostVantage brings clarity and simplicity to retail pharmacy - the most durable and frequent interaction in the health care journey - and ensures our pharmacies are appropriately compensated for the valuable clinical services they provide.

Health Services

Our Health Services segment consists of three key businesses: CVS Caremark®, Cordavis™ and Health Care Delivery. CVS Caremark drives aﬀordability of prescription drugs. Pharmacy Beneﬁt Managers (PBMs) are the only part of the drug supply chain whose role is to lower drug costs.

In fact, CVS Caremark members have an average out-of-pocket cost of less than $8 for a 30-day prescription. Economists have estimated that PBMs generate net value of over $100 billion per year for the U.S. health care system. Clients who fully transition to our new CVS Caremark TrueCost™ model ensure members see lower costs at the pharmacy counter, including the full pass-through of the rebates we generate from our negotiations with drug manufacturers. In 2025, we saw additional momentum as clients representing more than 75 percent of CVS Caremark commercial lives chose to implement two or more elements of the CVS Caremark TrueCost model.

We continue to transform the biosimilar market and improve access and aﬀordability of costly specialty medications. By establishing co-manufacturing capacity through Cordavis and collaborating with CVS Caremark and CVS Specialty® pharmacy, we successfully converted over 90 percent of eligible HUMIRA® patients to a low-cost biosimilar, delivering almost $1 billion of net savings for our clients. These savings demonstrate the power and potential of our integrated assets.

Our Health Care Delivery businesses achieved another year of solid growth in 2024, supported by integration points across CVS Health®. Signify Health® had a record year of In-Home Health Evaluations, including nearly doubling the number of Aetna® members served.

We continue to accelerate patient growth at Oak Street Health®, increasing the number of individuals enrolled in this best-in-class care model, including the number of Aetna members. We are also bringing together existing Oak Street Health and Signify Health care delivery capabilities for use more broadly across CVS Health to improve quality of care and better manage costs.

Our impact and value

Beyond our business, we take seriously our responsibility to make a positive impact on the people and communities we serve. Our Healthy 2030 approach outlines how we are paving the way for sustainability and working toward best practices in corporate responsibility.

I believe in our mission and strategy because I believe

in my colleagues. We take on the biggest challenges

in health care because we know we can solve them

in ways no one else can. We do our best work when people need us the most, and we show up every day to create a better health care experience.

I want to say thank you to our stockholders for your continued conﬁdence in CVS Health, and I thank my colleagues for giving you every reason to believe in our future.

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Overview

CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, ""CVS Health,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us""), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,000 walk-in and primary care medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 90 million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than 800,000 patients per year. We serve an estimated more than 36 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (""PDP""). We are creating new sources of value through our integrated model allowing us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.

The Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other.

Business Strategy

We are building a world of health around every consumer we serve, seeking to make it easier and more affordable to live a healthier life. This means delivering solutions that are more personalized, simpler to use and increasingly digital so consumers can receive care when, where and how they desire. We address holistic health _ physical, emotional, social and economic _ and we are creating new sources of value through our integrated care model which allows us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs. We believe our consumer-centric strategy will drive sustainable long-term growth and deliver value for all stakeholders.

Health Care Benefits Segment

The Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers, serving an estimated more than 36 million people as of December 31, 2024. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment's primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment's products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products.

Health Care Benefits Products and Services

The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as ""Insured"" and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as ""ASC."" Health Care Benefits segment products and services consist of the following:

• Commercial Medical: The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service (""POS""), preferred provider organization (""PPO""), health maintenance organization (""HMO"") and indemnity benefit (""Indemnity"") plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts (""HSAs"") and consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold.

Now, all eyes are on key inflation data, Federal Reserve signals and Big Bank earnings as traders search for footing in a week that could redefine the market’s path forward.

Inflation and Tariffs in Focus

With global markets under intense scrutiny, investors are turning their attention to key economic reports this week, starting with Thursday’s release of the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Friday’s Producer Price Index (PPI), both critical gauges of inflation.

Wells Fargo economists predict that inflation will remain stable in March, continuing the trend of easing pressures observed in recent months. February’s CPI, in particular, surprised many with a sharper-than-expected drop, fueling optimism about moderating price increases.

As these reports loom, attention will also shift to the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes, set to be released on Wednesday.

Market participants will look for any hints regarding the central bank’s next moves on interest rates. Additionally, remarks from Fed officials in the coming days are expected to shed further light on the broader economic outlook.

Alongside inflation data, consumer sentiment and credit reports will offer a fuller picture of economic health. On Tuesday, the NFIB small business optimism index will provide insight into the confidence of one of the most vital segments of the U.S. economy.

Big Banks Kick Off Earning Season

The first-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week, with reports from major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon, scheduled for Friday.

JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, will set the tone for the sector.

Investors will be looking for updates on the bank’s strong performance from the previous quarter, which saw a surprising surge in profits driven by growth in investment banking revenue and net interest income.

On the same day, BlackRock will also report its earnings following a record-breaking quarter for assets under management.

Investors are particularly keen on updates on the firm’s ambitious $30 billion AI infrastructure initiative, which involves major partners like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Elon Musk’s xAI.

Other major earnings this week include Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, CarMax on Thursday and Levi Strauss and Cal-Maine Foods later in the week.

As investors closely monitor these reports, many will be looking for insights into how the broader economy—including the ongoing impacts of tariffs and inflation—is affecting various sectors.

Eyes on Gold and VIX

Gold (XAU/USD) saw modest buying near $2,972 early Monday, halting its pullback from last week’s record high.

Safe-haven demand was driven by global market turmoil following President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and continued buying by China’s central bank, which has now purchased gold for five consecutive months.

Falling Treasury yields—amid expectations the Fed may resume rate cuts—supported gold, while a weaker USD added to the metal’s appeal. However, long-position liquidation to cover broader market losses has capped upside momentum.

At the same time, the Volatility Index (VIX) surged by 50%, reaching 50 and breaching key resistance levels, signaling heightened market stress. The 10-year Treasury yield also fell sharply, dropping below 4.16% and nearing significant support at 3.90%.

The widening divergence between the VIX and Treasury yields highlights deepening concerns about market instability.

Both Gold and VIX will be key indicators to watch closely this week as they could signal further market movements.",https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key-economic-indicators-markets-rattled-tariffs-us-inflation-big-bank-earnings_cropped.webp,N,,2025-04-07 12:15:30.477542

Chief Commercial Officer Matt Klein is also leaving and will be succeeded by insider Rana Ghosh.

The departures come as the carrier works to move away from its no-frills image and rebrand itself as a premium airline.

An interim office of the CEO, consisting of Chief Financial Officer Fred Cromer, Chief Operating Officer John Bendoraitis and General Counsel Thomas Canfield, will lead the company until a new chief is named.

Christie joined Spirit in 2012 as its finance chief and took the helm in 2019.

He guided the airline through the pandemic disruptions and a challenging period for low-cost carriers grappling with rising costs and a readiness among travelers to pay extra for a more comfortable journey as they pursued experiences.

The Florida-based carrier filed for bankruptcy protection last November, following years of losses and heavy debt, as well as failed merger attempts.

Spirit had been in merger talks with Frontier Group since at least 2022, but ended them in favor of a more attractive offer from rival JetBlue Airways.

Its merger with JetBlue was ultimately scrapped after a U.S. judge blocked it on anti-competition concerns.

Spirit, which has estimated that shift to premium would generate 13% more revenue per passenger, also plans to revamp its loyalty program and pursue alliances with other carriers.

Market Update

The Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.

Gross profit also fell from 28.58 million pounds to 23.06 million pounds, while operating profit lowered to 4.96 million pounds, a decrease on the 31.67 million pounds reported in 2023.
Michael Kors cited “general macroeconomic conditions” as the cause for the turnover decline, particularly in regards to a reduction in customer demand.
This came despite an increase in profit for the financial year, which rose from 39.72 million pounds to 66 million pounds.","The UK subsidiary of US brand Michael Kors, Michael Kors (UK) Limited, has announced plans to shutter five stores in the next fiscal year as macroeconomic conditions continue to impact consumer spending. The news was revealed in the firm’s latest annual report for the year ended 30 March 2024, filed with the UK’s Companies House.

While four stores will be closing permanently–including those in Newcastle, Milton Keyes, Manchester’s New Cathedral Street, and the concession in Harvey Nichols London–Michael Kor’s Regent Street store in London will be shuttering temporarily while “waiting for the relocation to a new near-by premises”.

In light of the plans, the company said that sales for FY25 are expected to decrease by 20 percent for both retail and e-commerce compared to 2024. Prices are also expected to drop in the “foreseeable future”, the report noted however, “in order to better meet consumer demand and counter competitors’ strategies on the market”.

Michael Kors cited “general macroeconomic conditions” as the cause for the turnover decline, particularly in regards to a reduction in customer demand. The company’s gross profit margin also fell in percentage compared to the previous year due to an “increase on markdowns aimed to push gross sales”.

This came despite an increase in profit for the financial year, which rose from 39.72 million pounds to 66 million pounds. This uptick reflected what the company said was the “sustainability” of the brand, where “despite the level of competition and the current challenges in the economic environment affecting the UK retail sector”, the UK subsidiary “continues to be a profitable business”.",https://r.fashionunited.com/r44SsYcn0xX28wMaGy-LAJDKeGFHDfk0XMwC9RtH2xg/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjQvMDkvMjMvaW1hZ2UwMDAwMS02ZjlmZmo0ci0yMDI0LTA5LTIzLmpwZWc.jpeg,N,,2025-04-07 08:04:32.477214

For JD, the US market is crucial, representing nearly 40% of global sales, especially after acquiring the Hibbett chain.
However, over-reliance on Nike – making up 45% of sales – ties JD’s fate closely to the sportswear giant.
Investor concerns are valid as tariffs disrupt and weigh down companies with strong US ties like JD Sports.
JD Sports, Nike, and other retailers might pivot quickly, seeking new sourcing destinations to avoid trade barriers, reflecting larger economic shifts and adaptation needs.","What’s going on here?

JD Sports is facing a 6% share dip, sparking concerns over its heavy reliance on Nike and vulnerability to US tariffs.

What does this mean?

JD Sports Fashion is in a slump, with shares dropping over 18% in the past month. The unveiling of new tariffs by US President Donald Trump anticipated a hit, dragging the FTSE 100 down by 4%. For JD, the US market is crucial, representing nearly 40% of global sales, especially after acquiring the Hibbett chain. However, over-reliance on Nike – making up 45% of sales – ties JD’s fate closely to the sportswear giant. Soaring tariffs on goods sourced from China (54%) and Vietnam (46%) add to the pressure. These tariffs impact both JD’s branded items and those of suppliers like Adidas and On. Panmure Liberum analysts predict this setback might be shared among brands and retailers, possibly reducing sector volumes.

Why should I care?

For markets: Tariff tensions hurt investor confidence.

Investor concerns are valid as tariffs disrupt and weigh down companies with strong US ties like JD Sports. With the US market vital to its strategy and a heavy dependency on Nike, unforeseen tariff developments can sharply influence market sentiments.

The bigger picture: Supply chain strains reshape fashion's future.

More broadly, trade tensions and significant tariffs hint at a shift for global supply strategies across industries. JD Sports, Nike, and other retailers might pivot quickly, seeking new sourcing destinations to avoid trade barriers, reflecting larger economic shifts and adaptation needs.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-v9IgoNwzH2496kzeDQjVYyCT.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=c4f328e434f07e5f05d885fe70b5e0d0,N,,2025-04-07 10:05:50.299975

BROWN, Getty Images",,,,,https://www.thestreet.com/retail/formerly-bankrupt-retail-healthcare-chain-may-go-bankrupt-again,"One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy.
Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.
Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018.
As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023.
Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.","It's been a very tough time to be in the retail business. Thousands of stores nationwide been closed over the past two decades because of e-commerce adoption, and the situation has accelerated since Covid forced more consumers inside and online.

Once formidable major retailers like Sears have been shuttered, and even retail store chains considered essential like pharmacy's have been stung by shifting consumer trends as competition has intensified.

It has gotten even harder to eke out a living as a retailer since inflation skyrocketed in 2022, crimping budgets. Inflation has eased a bit since then, but prices are still climbing and cash-strapped consumers have largely rotated away from discretionary purchases that retailers rely on.

In February, the Consumer Price Index showed inflation had increased to 2.8% from 2.4% last September, raising concern that prices could reignite, something even more in focus following newly instituted tariffs on imports that add more price pressures.

Worse, fears of economic recession are mounting this year as unemployment climbs.

Altogether, the backdrop has created an environment where even the strongest retailers are struggling. Weaker retailers? Well, they're on the ropes.

A retail reckoning forces companies into bankruptcy

Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows retailers to pare expenses and debt, giving them wiggle room necessary for a shot at survival. However, bankruptcy remains a last resort for companies.

Bankruptcy protection means damaged relationships with suppliers, bankers, workers, and customers. As a result, suppliers may cut off retailers, banks may not lend money necessary to operate, and workers and customers may move on to greener pastures.

Nevertheless, sometimes bankruptcy is the only option. Increasingly, that's been true for many companies.

It may be hard to believe today, but Sears ran 700 stores when it filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Bed Bath & Beyond had 1,500 stores in 2018, but fewer than 300 in 2023 when it went bankrupt, and none are open anymore. Christmas Tree Shops operated more than 80 stores before all were closed when it went bankrupt.

The economy has certainly been a driving force behind the retail reckoning, but fierce competition hasn't helped.

Walmart, Target, and Costco Wholesale have all seen significant revenue growth over the past decade as they successfully leverage their size to offer consumers lower prices, and expand into new markets.

Walmart and Costco's revenue have risen to $681 billion and $254 billion in 2024 from $408 billion and $78 billion in 2010, respectively.

One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy. Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.

In addition to fending off larger department stores, the national chain counted on by millions for essentials from toothpaste to prescriptions has also lost market share due to upstarts like Mark Cuban's CostPlus Drug Company, a low cost mail order pharmacy, and Hims, a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based telehealth platform.

Rite Aid enters, exits bankruptcy but woes remain

Rite Aid spent a lot of money acquiring rival pharmacies, including Brooks, in a bid to keep pace with Walgreens and CVS Health. The spending accelerated its retail footprint, but also saddled it with a mountain of debt that needed to be refinanced at higher rates when it came due.

The weight of its debt was already taking a toll before Covid struck. It attempted to sell itself to Walgreens in 2015, but the deal was revised after the U.S. government objected for antitrust concerns. Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018. A deal to sell itself to Albertsons was also scuttled in 2018.

Rite Aid continued to try to find a buyer but by 2022, when the Fed hiked interest rates, making debt refinancing more costly, it was in dire straights.

The final blow came in March 2023. The Department of Justice filed a civil suit against Rite Aid alleging pharmacists “repeatedly filled prescriptions for controlled substances with obvious red flags"" and that Rite Aid ""intentionally deleted internal notes about suspicious prescribers.”

Similar suits had previously been settled by Walgreens and CVS Health for $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, figures that Rite Aid couldn't match.

As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023. While in bankruptcy, it cut deals with lenders, closed over 500 stores, roughly a quarter of its locations, and settled the Justice Department's suit for $7.5 million and an unsubordinated, general unsecured claim of $401.8 million.

The company exited bankruptcy in September 2024, saying at the time it ""has successfully completed its financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11, marking a new beginning as a stronger company with a rightsized store footprint, more efficient operating model, significantly less debt, and additional financial resources.”

Unfortunately, the restructuring may not have been enough to guarantee Rite Aid's success, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The WSJ said on April 4 that Rite Aid's management is seeking buyers again and contemplating another bankruptcy filing. Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.

There's no telling what might happen to Rite Aid's remaining 1,300 stores if it sells itself or enters bankruptcy protection again. It's certainly possible more stores will close, leaving additional customers in the lurch, searching for a new pharmacy.

One potential option may be to follow in Walgreens footsteps. In March, the nation's second largest retail pharmacy chain agreed to sell itself to private equity player Sycamore Partners in a deal worth about $10 billion.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDE2MDQzMzk2MjEyMTc1/gettyimages-1130947807.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 22:59:13.344686

(GADC), or McDonald’s Philippines, plans to invest at least ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion this year to open more than 65 stores, with the aim of reaching 1,000 stores in two years.

This comes as GADC Founder and Chairman George T. Yang said they will embark on an accelerated growth path for the quick-service restaurant (QSR) giant after McDonald’s Corp. of the United States (US) granted Yang and his son, GADC President and CEO Kenneth S. Yang, a fresh 20-year franchise for the Philippines.

“This 2025, We will be opening our 800th store,” said the younger Yang. McDonald’s opened 65 stores last year and ended 2024 with a network of 792 stores nationwide.

In a media interview, GADC’s CEO said, “We will continue to build new restaurants all over the Philippines. We grow through our company-owned stores as well as through our franchise restaurants.”

“For this year, most likely, we should grow about the same as what we did last year, which is 65 stores. Hopefully we will surpass it,” said Yang.

Since 65 new stores in a year was an all-time high for the company, he said, “This 2025, we aim to break our record new store openings.”

While expansion will be nationwide, Yang said most of the new stores will be outside the National Capital Region (NCR)—in cities in southern and northern Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

“We see our growth coming from areas outside of NCR that have rapidly been developing. We’re excited to open more stores and bring McDonald’s closer to more Filipinos,” Yang said.

He noted that, “The country is growing and there is progress in these areas so that is where we will be going.”

He said that they will likely maintain the current ratio of 55 percent company-owned stores and 45 percent franchise outlets.

Yang said they spent around ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion for the renovation of older restaurants and construction of new ones, and capital expenditures (capex) this year should at least be equal or higher.

In 2005, McDonald’s Philippines became a 100-percent Filipino-owned company with George and Kenneth Yang as its majority owners and tycoon Andrew Tan’s Alliance Global Group Inc. as its investment partner.

This strategic move paved the way for the company to look towards a digitally led future, underpinned by growing demand for seamless omni-channel customer experience.

The company extended its reach by growing its delivery business through digital initiatives. It was the first QSR to have an online delivery channel in 2009 and the first to launch a delivery app in 2014.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

That being said, you can find a dozen eggs for under $5 in most grocery stores. If you join a warehouse club like Costco or Sam’s Club, you might even be able to get a better deal.

It’s easy to understand why people do not like seeing the price of everyday staples go up. In reality, however, most families probably eat no more than a couple of dozen eggs a week.

If they eat the full two dozen, let’s say that their expenses increase by basically five dollars per week. That’s $260 a year.

Admittedly, eggs are not the only staple that has increased in price, which is causing many Americans to feel the pinch of inflation and higher prices.

Spending more at the grocery store each week is death by 1,000 paper cuts, which is a painful way to die.

But if you suffer one giant cut, the reality is you’re just as dead. Americans have some options to buy food produced in this country that won’t be impacted by tariffs.

Certain staples like coffee, well, almost certainly increase, but even there, there are options, at least if all you want is a caffeine fix. When it comes to electronics, there are no options.

You can’t get an iPhone, a laptop, a television, or most appliances that come from US manufacturers. And admittedly, unlike eggs, you can put off upgrading your phone or buying a new television.

At some point, however, whether it’s your washing machine, your refrigerator, your smart phone, or whatever type of computer you might use, something will break. When that happens, you are going to face a reality that’s going to be very painful.

That’s something Best Buy’s CEO is warning consumers and investors about.

Best Buy buys from China and Mexico

Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Sue Barry did not pull any punches when it came to discussing tariffs during the electronics retailer's fourth-quarter earnings call.

""Against this backdrop, I need to pause a moment to address the topic of tariffs. International trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively,"" she shared.

The CEO also made it clear that tariffs would be passed on to the retailer, which would then have to pass them onto consumers.

""While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,"" she shared.

Barry admitted that she does not have all the answers.

""This is because it is a highly dynamic situation, with uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount, and countries involved, in addition to the potential action of others in the industry, as well as the potential reaction of American consumers,"" she said.

Best Buy, American consumers face higher prices

Best Buy does have flexibility on some products and Barry wanted to make it clear that it will be actively looking to offset the increased costs as much as possible.

""I want to stress that our deeply tenured and talented teams are experienced at operating in volatile conditions, and this is also a situation where our partnerships with vendors are extremely valuable. We intend to execute the strategic plan we set for this year while navigating the tariff environment,"" she added.

CFO Matthew Bilunas made it clear, or at least as clear as someone speaking in financial terms could, that consumers will pay more.

""We're assuming in this estimation that a material portion of the costs are passed on to us by the vendors and then either, that's either directly broken out or blended in with the higher COGS (cost of goods sold) or through some level of promotional positioning. Of course, you know, we prefer not to raise prices. But because of the higher COGS, we need to enact some price increases, and that is going to vary based on product category, SKUs, competitive environment, and other factors,"" he shared.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgxMzEzMDc1NDYxMjM1ODE1/best-buy.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:43.530339

The president himself is determined to impose higher prices on his citizens, even though many Americans have now realized the truth of tariffs and that we will all be responsible for paying for them. Even though equities in the tech, automotive, and other sectors have declined, the former reality TV star’s most recent announcement was concerning from a fashion perspective.

Trump’s tariffs are having a much bigger impact than expected on Nike

Trump’s most recent list includes nations that produce clothing, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which are presumably further down the alphabet than Denmark, the European Union, and Greenland. Besides Nike, huge companies like Adidas and Puma source their supplies from the two nations listed, and Trump’s decision has caused their stock market value to plummet like a driverless Tesla into the Hudson River. Following the announcement of the news, shares of Skechers, Deckers, and Crocs also declined.

On Wednesday, the United States levied reciprocal tariffs of 46% on Vietnamese goods, 49% on Cambodian goods, 34% on Chinese goods, 32% on Indonesian goods, and 36% on Thai goods. Although Nike’s stock is still steady for the time being, analysts believe that the American brand will decline soon because it also depends significantly on imports from the aforementioned countries. Nike itself anticipates a more than 10% decline in revenue in the upcoming quarter, according to CNBC, and their figures are significantly worse than those of analysts.

Finance director Matt Friend anticipates that Nike’s initiatives will have the most impact in the fourth quarter, with revenue and gross margin headwinds projected to moderate. The corporation is also dealing with external challenges such as geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, variable foreign exchange rates, and tax rules, all of which may influence consumer confidence.

Besides Nike, American Eagle, and Wayfair could also be impacted due to Trump’s tariffs

Brands and retailers have shifted some or all of their production out of China and are now using Vietnam to manufacture everything from couches to sneakers. For many years, businesses wishing to stay out of the crossfire of U.S. trade conflicts with Beijing turned to China’s southern neighbor. They are now unable to avoid President Donald Trump as he broadens his trade war globally. As part of a new round of international tariffs announced Wednesday, Trump declared he would impose a 46% levy on Vietnamese products.

Major companies in the clothing, furniture, and toy industries may soon see cost rises as a result, and some of them may boost prices for customers. On April 9, the Vietnam tariffs go into force. Donald Trump announced a new round of international tariffs on Wednesday, including a 46% duty on Vietnamese imports. This may soon result in cost rises for large companies in the toy, furniture, and clothing industries, some of which may raise prices for customers. On April 9, the tariffs on Vietnam go into force.

Moreover, Mexico overtook China as the largest supplier of commodities to the United States in 2023, after China had been the leading exporter for more than 20 years. Government statistics from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show that, with $438.9 billion in products sold in 2024, China is now the second-largest supplier to the United States. Vietnam has also grown in popularity as a destination for businesses seeking to diversify their manufacturing sources and lower the risks associated with trade disputes with China.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nike.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:47.825213

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands.","Starbucks is one of the most well-known and beloved coffee chains in the United States. With thousands of stores across the country, the company has kept enormous popularity over the years. Its success lies in a varied offering of beverages and a service that aims to be quick and efficient.

However, behind every cup they sell, there are small details that often go unnoticed. An example of this is, for instance, the measurement marks that allow baristas to prepare drinks with precision.

This Is the Change That Starbucks Has Already Implemented in the United States

For years, Starbucks cups included black marks on their sides. These lines were not just decorative, as some might think. Their function was very practical: they allowed employees to measure the ingredients of each drink accurately.

Each line on the tall, grande, and venti cups marked a precise amount of liquid. This facilitated the quick and efficient preparation of popular drinks like the iced chai tea latte. Thus, Starbucks baristas didn't need external measuring tools, which optimized the service.

However, recently, Starbucks made an important change: it modified the marks to a more visible design. The new cups feature white and black lines, which improve visibility in both light and dark beverages. Additionally, these cups include raised dots to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

This change wasn't the only one. Starbucks implemented opaque paper cups in 14 states in the United States, removing the measurement marks. The company also opted for compostable cups and lids made of the same material, reducing its use of plastic.

The transition has caused divided opinions among customers. While some applaud Starbucks's effort to promote a more sustainable change, others lament the loss of the transparent cups. Customers can no longer see their drink—and what's left of it in the cup—as they did before.

Despite the criticism it has received, Starbucks continues to bet firmly on innovation and continuous improvement. The company keeps seeking a balance between functionality and sustainability. So, although some customers may take time to adapt to the new designs, it is likely that over time they will get used to the modifications.

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands. The brand continues to stand out for its ability to adapt and stay at the forefront, establishing itself as a leader in innovation within the sector.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-starbucks-con-bandera-estados-unidos-al-lado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-06 09:01:53.922466

The US coffee giant, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, had last year announced plans to nearly triple its store count to 1,000 outlets by 2028. But that target is now facing headwinds, as middle-class consumers pull back on discretionary spending and rivals flood the market with newer and more affordable café options.

In an interview with The Financial Times, Sunil D’Souza, Chief Executive of Tata Consumer Products, said Starbucks opened only ""a little over half"" the 30 stores it had targeted for the December quarter. “We saw traffic dropping,” D’Souza said. “So I told my team, let’s moderate a bit. We’ll continue to grow and we’re still opening outlets, but we’ve slowed it down momentarily.”

Starbucks opened a net 16 stores in the three months through December, bringing the total to 473 across 74 Indian cities — well below the post-pandemic record of 29 store additions in the January-March quarter last year.

India, though traditionally a tea-drinking nation, has seen a boom in speciality cafés in recent years, led by homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave Coffee, alongside global entrants such as Tim Hortons, Pret A Manger, and Costa Coffee. The report said this surge in new-age coffee brands, coupled with changing urban preferences, is reshaping how Indians consume beverages outside the home.

In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook. The report said the coffee chain introduced smaller ""Picco"" cup sizes, a milky short masala chai priced at Rs320, and food items like chilli paneer sandwiches — part of its effort to blend international appeal with Indian flavours.

To make its cafés more inviting in smaller cities, the company also moved away from darker, high-end interiors to lighter colours that signal affordability and accessibility.

D’Souza said in the interview that in non-metro markets, many consumers still view the brand as premium. “Often we’ve heard that people are not entering because they see this as... a luxury,” he said.

Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India. “There’s a long runway — it’s just that in a country like India, you’ve got to have a slightly longer perspective,” D’Souza said. He added that the 1,000-store goal still stands, though the timeline “might go up or down by a year.”

During its third quarter investor call, the company said affordability-focused efforts are gaining traction, even as demand pressures persist. The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise. Expansion picked up in East India, with new stores in Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bilaspur, and Gangtok.

To improve local relevance, the company introduced a “classic menu” tailored to Indian taste preferences. Initial trials showed promising repeat purchases, the company noted. It also launched a Diwali 360-campaign with a media reach of over 40 million, and introduced Monsoon Malabar — a reserve small-lot coffee developed exclusively for the Indian market.

Globally too, Starbucks has hit a rough patch. The report noted the company has seen four straight quarters of declining same-store sales, weighed down by slowing footfall in both the US and China — its two largest markets. In China, it has been undercut by faster-growing rivals like Luckin Coffee.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-04-06%2Fzz6jbkqa%2Fhiroko-nishimura-SiSLeFTr5Cg-unsplash.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-04-06 06:01:14.403466

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”. MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

Some 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the U.S. on Saturday in what organizers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.

Thousands were streaming into downtown Washington as the protests got underway. Organisers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the National Mall.

The protests in the U.S. will give Trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to Trump’s raft of executive orders.

Some 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests are planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.

Protesters were lining the busy thoroughfare of Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C., awaiting buses to take them downtown. They were carrying signs with slogans such as “No Kings in the USA” and “Deport Musk.”

Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the Washington Monument.

She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”

David Madden, a 75-year old Army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from Dayton, Ohio, to demonstrate against “the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the American people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that I believe is essentially racist.”

Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London.

Wall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president’s risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs.

Experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday’s extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative – but just how bad remains highly uncertain.

Here are the key stories at a glance:

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.

A JLR spokesperson said: “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of Britain’s biggest producers, selling 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually.

Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales and JLR is at the centre of Britain’s car industry, accounting for £1 in every £8 of the country’s exports.

The Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. Shipping vehicles across the Atlantic takes about 21 days.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in central London as part of global demonstrations against Donald Trump’s administration.

Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on Saturday afternoon with banners which read “No to Maga hate” and “Dump Trump”.

The rally is one of hundreds of so-called “hands off” demonstrations around the world – including in cities across the US, Paris and Berlin.

The movement has been organised by more than 150 groups, including civil rights groups and trade unions.

A 25% levy on all foreign cars imported into America came into force on Thursday, and a wider “baseline” 10% tariff on goods imported from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning.

Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their “concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia” in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Starmer’s office said.

The UK’s prime minister spoke to the French president on Saturday, the latest in a series of calls with world leaders following the announcement of the US levies.

Issuing a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister spoke with President Macron following this week’s announcement that the US will impose additional tariffs. They agreed that a trade war was in nobody’s interests but nothing should be off the table and that it was important to keep business updated on developments.

“The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia.

“Following discussions between military planners in Ukraine this week, they discussed the good progress that has been made on the Coalition of the Willing.

“The prime minister and president agreed to stay in close contact over the coming weeks.”

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Donald Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signaled little concern about the ongoing nosedive, reports Reuters.

“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

“If I were to analyse in my old hat, and this is the only time I’m going to talk about it … what’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a Maga problem,” Bessent, who ran a hedge fund until being tapped as treasury secretary by Trump, said.

“Mag 7” refers to the shares of the “Magnificent 7” – a group of seven high-performing tech stocks that had helped drive the market higher before its recent selloff. Maga refers to Trump’s “Make America great again” political slogan.

US stocks have tumbled by about 10% in the two days after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating.

It is a drop that market analysts and large investors themselves have laid at the feet of Trump’s aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth, reports Reuters.

Stocks did take a hit in late January when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent services. It resulted in a record one-day loss of nearly $600bn in value from the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, one of the “Magnificent 7”. But the market soon found its footing again and by mid-February, the benchmark S&P 500 index had regained a record-high level.

Then stocks turned south again starting in late February after a widely followed survey of consumers showed households growing broadly pessimistic about the economy’s prospects and fearful that Trump’s push for tariffs would drive up inflation, reports Reuters.

A raft of other surveys of businesses and consumers since then have flagged similar concerns, and other data has shown the pace of activity has slowed over the course of the first quarter of 2025. The S&P has lost nearly 14% since 19 February, and nearly $10tn of US stock market value has been erased.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has been dismissive of the drop as well.

Trump himself on Friday retweeted a social media post bearing the caption “Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market” and featuring images of the president pointing at a large downward red arrow and of him signing executive orders at the White House.

Meanwhile, Bessent also told Carlson the administration retains a “strong dollar” policy and dismissed assertions by some analysts that the tariff drive was a deliberate effort to weaken the dollar to make US goods more competitive on global markets.

“No one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the US dollar other than President Trump or myself,” Bessent said. “We are the only ones that speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy.”

“We have a strong-dollar policy and we are putting in all of the necessary ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run,” he said.

The dollar has shed nearly 6% of its value against major trading partners’ currencies since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, reports Reuters.

'Hang tough, it won’t be easy': Trump defiant on tariffs

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.

The comments came as the US president’s widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.

“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.

“This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

A 10% “baseline” tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.

The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes”.

Come 9 April, about 60 trading partners – including the European Union, Japan and China – are to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.

Already, Trump’s sharp 34%tariff on Chinese goods, to kick in next week, triggered Beijing’s announcement of its own 34% tariff on US products from 10 April.

Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict the export of rare-earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.

“China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,” Trump said in his post. “They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly.”

But other major trading partners held back as they digested the unfolding international standoff amid fears of a recession.

Leading garment producer Bangladesh holds crisis talks on US tariffs

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Textile and garment production accounts for about 80% of exports in Bangladesh, and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hard hit in a revolution that toppled the government last year.

Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

Bangladesh exports $8.4bn of garments annually to the US, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national trade body. That totals about 20% of Bangladesh’s total ready-made garments exports, reports afp.

“Chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has convened an emergency meeting … to discuss the US tariff issue,” a government statement read, with the meeting to take place late Saturday in the capital, Dhaka. Top experts, advisers and officials will attend, it added.

Bangladesh’s tax authority, the National Board of Revenue, is also expected to meet to review the fallout from the tariffs.

Rakibul Alam Chowdhury, chair of RDM Group, a major manufacturer with an estimated $25m turnover, said on Thursday that the industry would lose trade. “Buyers will go to other cost-competitive markets – this is going to be a massive blow for our industry,” he said.

Several garment factories produce clothing for the US market alone, report AFP. Anwar Hossain, administrator of the BGMEA, has told AFP that the industry was “not ready” for the tariff impact.

Bangladesh, the second-largest producer after China, manufactures garments for global brands – including for US firms such as Gap Inc, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi Strauss.

Anti-Trump protests expected in US today

Kira Lerner

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.

MoveOn, one of the organizations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labor, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

“This is shaping up to be the biggest single-day protest in the last several years of American history,” Ezra Levin, a founder of Indivisible, one of the groups planning the event, said on a recent organizing call.

The largest event is expected to be on the National Mall in Washington DC, where members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, are scheduled to speak to crowds.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most U.S. trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S. duty-free.

This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34% on all U.S. goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan told public broadcaster RTHK, however, Hong Kong would not impose separate countermeasures, citing the need for the city to remain “free and open”.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said:

The market has spoken.

Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, says he is prepared to dance if it means sidestepping some of the worst of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Last week he sent a letter to India’s president, Droupadi Murmu, urging her to join him in a tango to celebrate 75 years of ­bilateral trade.

Xi said it was “the right choice” for the two countries to be “partners of mutual achievement and realise the ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’”, which, he added, “fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples.”

Beijing is on a wide-ranging charm offensive, aimed at redirecting its exports away from the US to other willing destinations as Washington erects trade barriers.

Tariffs on China imposed by the US president amounting to 20% earlier this year were more than doubled last week to 54% and an effective average rate of 65%, raising the cost of Chinese imports to a level that many analysts believe will be uncompetitive.

The response from Beijing was swift. A sell-off on financial markets intensified after China’s finance ministry said it would respond in kind, adding 34% to the tariff on all US goods from 10 April.

Investors worry that a recession in the US cannot be ruled out as the trade war intensifies and companies hunker down, cutting investment and jobs to weather the storm.

John Denton, head of the International Chambers of Commerce, likens the onset of these tariff wars to the oil shock of the 1970s, such is its seismic importance. “The overriding theme is the battle for supremacy between China and the US for global trade dominance,” he said.

Jaguar Land Rover will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of president Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, according to a report in the Times newspaper.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters on Saturday.

A pause in shipments would add to fears over the impact from tariffs on the UK’s car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly. The US is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20% share, data from industry body SMMT shows, reports Reuters.

Jaguar Land Rover, one of the UK’s biggest producers by volume, sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually. Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales.

The US 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April. The previous day, Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe, upending world trade.

The Times said that Jaguar Land Rover is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests, reports Reuters.

President Donald Trump announced across-the-board import tariffs on Wednesday with much higher duties for dozens of trading partners, including Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the US and is facing a 32% duty on its products. The US tariffs, however, do not apply to semiconductors, a major Taiwanese export.

Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

Lai “hopes to give industry the greatest support, stabilise the economic situation, ensure Taiwan’s industry’s global competitiveness, and safeguard our country’s national interests and the continued steady progress of our economy”, Kuo said.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an important supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on whether it attended the meeting. TSMC is in its quiet period ahead of first quarter earnings announcement on 17 April.

On Friday, Taiwan’s government announced T$88bn ($2.67bn/£2.07bn) in financial help for companies and industries to deal with the impact of the US tariffs.

Taiwan, which says the tariffs are unreasonable, has said it will discuss them with the US and has not announced any retaliatory tariffs.

US president Donald Trump has long been an advocate of tariffs – once describing them as the most beautiful word in the dictionary – and his promise to impose them was a central plank of his presidential election campaign. In anticipation, Downing Street developed a defensive strategy that revolved around building a strong relationship with Trump’s White House – despite clear political differences – and launching talks to strike an economic deal that would secure tariff exemptions.

Trade talks between the UK and US began soon after Trump’s inauguration, before the prime minister visited Washington in February, with the goal of agreeing a relatively narrow deal focused on advanced technologies. Talks intensified before UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ own visit to meet Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, just over two weeks ago.

UK officials were assured by their US counterparts that they were in a strong position to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. “By then we knew what the faultlines were, and we were broadly there, so we just had some details to thrash out,” an official said.

The two key figures leading the negotiations are Reynolds and Varun Chandra, a corporate strategist turned senior No 10 aide known as the prime minister’s “business whisperer”. Officials have been impressed by how Chandra has navigated the US administration. “He just gets them, and they get him. The talks have been much more corporate in tone than trade negotiations usually are. That’s his world,” one said.

A senior trade department official, Kate Joseph, and Keir Starmer’s economic international affairs adviser, Michael Ellam, have been working behind the scenes at home to get the Whitehall machine ready. Multiple scenarios were drawn up depending on what tariff regime Trump imposed.

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.97%.

For the most recent quarter, U.S. Bancorp was expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, but it reported $1.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.94%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1 per share, while it actually produced $1.03 per share, a surprise of 3%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For U.S. Bancorp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

U.S. Bancorp has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 16, 2025.

With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Mad Money Twitter - Jim Cramer Twitter - Facebook - Instagram Questions, comments, suggestions for the ""Mad Money"" website?","CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide insight into company expectations for dealing with President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Big banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley all report results on Friday, April 11.

The consumer price index report on Thursday will give the latest numbers on inflation.

After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods. Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

Money Report

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

""Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,"" Cramer said.

Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.
On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results.
Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results.
Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.","After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods . Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

The Annual Meeting will be held solely by means of remote communication to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of their geographic location.

Our strategic priorities are accelerating our journey to becoming America's leading and most trusted health care company.

Our priorities

Best-in-class businesses

Strong integrated capabilities

Leading digital strategy and tech-enabled simplicity and efficiency

Disciplined capital stewardship

Message from Our Executive Chair, Our Chief Executive Officer and Our Lead Independent Director

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

Our aspiration is to be the leading and most trusted health care company in America. We believe this is possible because of the businesses we have, the strategy we are executing, and most importantly, our colleagues who serve 185 million people across our country.

Our integrated model allows us to deliver greater access, simpler experiences, lower costs and better outcomes. In short, we are uniquely positioned to provide the things people want the most from health care.

Financial performance

We are confident that the changes made in 2024 have set CVS Health® on a strong path for the future. We took decisive actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our Aetna® business, continued to implement our innovative and transparent pharmacy models, increased our focus on operational excellence and enhanced our leadership team. In 2024, we delivered $372.8 billion in revenue, generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow and returned nearly $3.4 billion to stockholders.

Maximizing value

Our ongoing commitment to driving innovation and integrating our businesses creates value for patients, members, customers and stockholders. In 2024, we made significant progress with our industry-first pharmacy models, CVS CostVantage™ and CVS Caremark TrueCost™. In addition, Cordavis™ contributed to net client savings of almost $1 billion by redefining the biosimilar drug marketplace. Our integrated teams helped Aetna achieve exceptional Star Ratings, with 88% of our Medicare Advantage members in 4-Star plans or higher.

Technology at the foundation

Technology helps create exceptional experiences for our consumers while simplifying how our colleagues work. We redesigned our CVS Health app in January 2025 to seamlessly connect users to our services and to the care they need - all in one place. Our clinicians can use artificial intelligence to summarize case notes, which frees up their time to engage with patients more deeply. Through the strategic and responsible use of technology, we are streamlining and connecting experiences for the millions of people we serve.

Management updates

Our management team and Board of Directors work together on the advancement of the Company's strategic plan. We proactively engage with stockholders to enhance our understanding and to be responsive to your perspectives and preferences.

We made key leadership team updates in 2024 to drive focused execution of our strategy, including David's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") and Roger's appointment as Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Prem Shah was appointed Group President, CVS Health. In this newly created role, Prem is responsible for operational performance and integrated value creation across our CVS Caremark®, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Health Care Delivery businesses. Steve Nelson also joined the leadership team as the newly appointed President of Aetna, bringing deep expertise leading managed care and health care delivery companies. Steve is working closely with David to build on and accelerate the plan to improve performance at Aetna. In addition, Heidi Capozzi was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer leading the human resources, labor relations, compensation and benefits and corporate social responsibility teams.

i

Board changes

We made a number of changes to our Board, including naming Mike Mahoney as Lead Independent Director to help provide dynamic Board leadership while maintaining strong independent oversight. We also enhanced our highly qualified Board with the appointment of four new directors, Leslie Norwalk, Larry Robbins, Guy Sansone and Doug Shulman, further sharpening our ability to achieve our bold ambitions. They bring skills that complement those of other Board members, including significant proficiency in health care, health services and other regulated industries, as well as areas corresponding to the evolution of our business.

We'd like to express our gratitude to J.P. Millon, who is retiring in May after having served on our Board since March 2007. J.P.'s extensive background in the pharmacy benefit management, pharmaceutical and life sciences businesses has been instrumental in the growth of the Company, and we wish him well in his future endeavors. We also acknowledge the many contributions of Nancy-Ann DeParle and Mary Schapiro, who have provided over eleven years and eight years, respectively, of diligent service to the Board and are not standing for re-election this year. Nancy-Ann has chaired our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for the past five years as our Board and management team has been updated, and her experience as the ""health care czar"" under President Obama has made her an invaluable member of the Health Services and Technology Committee since it was formed in 2016. Mary's background as the former Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA"") has made her a vital contributor to our Audit Committee, as well as our Investment and Finance Committee during its separate existence in the key years following the Aetna merger. We thank both Nancy-Ann and Mary and wish them the best in the future.

Annual Meeting of Stockholders

We will host our Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually at 8:00 a.m. ET on May 15, 2025 to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of location. As a stockholder, your vote is important to us and we encourage you to vote at your earliest convenience.

In 2025, we are building momentum across our businesses to drive our strategy forward and meet our financial commitments. Thank you for your investment in CVS Health. Your support is critical as we work to deliver simply better health for all Americans.

Sincerely,

Roger N. Farah

GES reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While net sales increased, earnings decreased from the year-ago period. Sales growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of rag & bone (concluded in April 2024), alongside modest gains in GES’ core operations.

The company is optimistic about growth opportunities across its core Guess brand, the newly launched Guess Jeans line and the acquisition of rag & bone. GES plans to improve overall profitability by sharpening its global direct-to-consumer strategy and streamlining business portfolio. These strategic moves are expected to contribute to a $30 million boost in operating profit by fiscal 2027.

GES’ Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

GES posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. However, the bottom line declined 26.4% from $2.01 reported in the prior-year period.

Guess?, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Guess?, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Guess?, Inc. Quote

Net revenues were $932.3 million, rising 4.6% year over year and surpassing the consensus mark of $899 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, net revenues rose 9%. The strong performance was driven by the rag & bone acquisition and positive momentum in the wholesale businesses across Europe and the Americas, and higher licensing revenues. All operating segments contributed to revenue growth, with the exception of the Asia segment, which saw a decline.

Gross margin contracted to 44.1% from 45.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 32.8% from 29.1% in the prior-year quarter.

Adjusted earnings from operations were $106.5 million, down 18.2% from $130.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, down from 14.6% reported in the same quarter last year. This downtick was mainly caused by increased expenses, higher advertising and store-related costs, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses. These pressures were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation.

Decoding GES’ Segmental Performance

Revenues in the Americas Retail segment rose 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% at cc. However, retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, declined 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% at cc. The operating margin in the segment was 8.9%, down 6.1% year over year. This decline was caused by the adverse effects of negative comparable sales, higher expenses and increased markdowns.

Americas Wholesale revenues soared 63% on a reported basis and 69% at cc. The segment’s operating margin fell to 12.8%, down 15.7% year over year due to the impact of newly acquired businesses and lower product margin.

The Europe segment’s revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 7% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) remained relatively flat on a reported basis and increased 5% at cc. The segmental operating margin was 15.4%, down 2.6% year over year, due to higher expenses and the impact of newly acquired businesses. This was partially offset by lower markdowns.

Asia revenues decreased 15% on a reported basis and 11% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) dropped 16% and 11% on a reported basis and at cc, respectively. The operating margin in the segment was 1.3%, down 3.5% year over year. This downside was primarily due to lower product margins and reduced revenues.

Licensing revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and at cc. Segmental operating margin was 94.8% compared with 92.7% in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by lower expenses.

GES’ Financial Health Snapshot & Shareholder-Friendly Moves

The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $187.7 million and long-term debt and finance lease obligations of nearly $150.7 million. Stockholders’ equity was around $505 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2025, was $121.7 million. Free cash flow for the same period amounted to $29.8 million. For fiscal 2026, free cash flow is expected to be $55 million.

GES announced a quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on May 2, 2025, to its shareholders on record as of April 16.

The company repurchased about 2.6 million shares for $60.3 million during fiscal 2025.

What to Expect From GES in the Future?

For fiscal 2026, Guess? anticipates revenues to grow of 3.9-6.2%.

The adjusted operating margin is expected to be 4.5-5.4%. The GAAP operating margin is likely to be 4.3-5.2%.

Management expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32-$1.76 in fiscal 2026 compared with the $1.96 recorded in fiscal 2025. On a GAAP basis, EPS is envisioned in the range of $1.03-$1.37 compared with the 77 cents reported in fiscal 2025.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management expects revenue growth of 5.8-7.5%. On an adjusted basis, Guess? expects to post a loss of 74-65 cents per share. On a GAAP basis, it expects to deliver a loss in the range of 75-66 cents per share.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 29.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 30.5% decline.

The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).
“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%.
Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%.
The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.","New figures released from climate change NGO Opportunity Green claim profits on an “extraordinary scale” have been made by leading shipping companies in the years since the pandemic.

The world’s 139 largest shipping companies – accounting for 90% of the world’s fleet – made almost US$340.0Bn in profits from 2019-2023, the last year for which full figures are available. Of this sum, 93% was taken by the top 10 largest companies, the report says.

“The pandemic created an enormous windfall for shipping companies as the easing of lockdown restrictions caused a spike in global demand for freight, pushing prices up to record levels. But freight prices have soared again since 2023, as a result of disruptions to global shipping routes including drought restrictions on the Panama Canal and attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea. As freight prices have risen, so have shipping company profits,” the report said.

It added, “Yet despite these record earnings, shipping company taxes have remained catastrophically low and many of the world’s biggest shipping companies are failing to pay their fair share of taxes.”

It said the top 10 largest companies paid only US$30.0Bn in tax from 2019-2023, at a tax rate of around 10%. The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).

“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%. The report shows the problem is biggest in the largest and most profitable companies, with nine of the top 10 from high income developed economies and four of those headquartered in wealthy OECD member states. Over 2019-2023, members of the OECD have an average tax rate on shipping companies of around 4%, compared with a rest of the world average of 16%.”

A statement said, “The top three publicly listed European shipping companies, Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag Lloyd, paid only $4.6Bn in taxes in total over five years, despite making nearly half of all profits globally (US$137.0Bn). Had the top 10 largest shipping companies paid the average rate of tax faced by other companies in their home countries, the additional tax raised would have been US$42.0Bn.”

Economics at Opportunity Green senior director James Meadway said, “This is a shameful set of statistics, and shipping companies must change course, start paying their fair share of taxes and get on board with the true impact their operations are having on the planet. The international shipping sector is a significant contributor to climate change, producing 1Bn tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, but nowhere is this felt more acutely than in the Global South, where frontline countries are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%. If these four companies alone were taxed at the same rate as other big corporations where they are headquartered, more than US$38.0Bn extra in taxes would have been raised over those five years.”

Opportunity Green chief executive and founder Aoife O’Leary said, “These figures should act as a stark warning as member states from all over the globe gather at the International Maritime Organization to discuss the possibility of a levy on international shipping emissions. The shipping industry currently produces 1Bn tonnes of GHG emissions each year, and yet it continues to dodge paying fair taxes. It now has the unique chance to put that right by becoming the first industry to introduce a global levy and raise revenues that could be directed to deal with the worst of climate change in climate vulnerable countries.”

The top 10 largest shipping companies are Moller-Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, China COSCO, Ocean Network Express, Evergreen Marine Corp, Orient Overseas, Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp, Wan Hai Lines and SITC.

A statement said all 10 companies were contacted for their responses to the figures in the report. Of these, Wan Hai Lines, Maersk and Orient Overseas responded to confirm the figures provided about their company are accurate. No replies were received from the remaining top 10 companies. The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/152/Hapag_Lloyd_Berlin_Express_web_Main.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 13:09:03.379623

Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 11, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.5%.

Revenues are expected to be $4.74 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon?

For The Bank of New York Mellon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.49%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.72, delivering a surprise of +10.26%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Bank of New York Mellon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

For fiscal 2025, analysts forecast ELV to post EPS of $34.17, reflecting a 3.4% increase from $33.04 in fiscal 2024. Looking ahead, EPS is projected to grow 14.2% year-over-year to $39.02 in fiscal 2026.

ELV has underperformed the broader markets over the past 52 weeks, with shares down 8.1%, compared to the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 1.9% gain and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLV) marginal dip over the same period.

Medical membership declined 2% to 45.7 million, missing estimates, largely due to Medicaid disenrollment.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI is thought to have increased 0.2%, with core CPI up 0.3%.

The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.","Welcome to Michael Kramer’s pick of the top three market events to look out for in the week beginning Monday 7 April.

The big US banks kick off what is likely to be an interesting corporate earnings season in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs and the heightened sense of economic uncertainty. Trump’s ‘reciprocal’ levies announcement on Wednesday sent the S&P 500 4.8% lower on Thursday, its biggest one-day drop since Covid in 2020.

Also coming up are the March readings of the US consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Inflation could rise in the future if the tariff-induced increases in import costs are passed on to US consumers, though it may take time for the full impact of the tariffs to show up in the CPI and PPI data.

In the UK, meanwhile, February GDP data out on Friday could shed light on whether the Bank of England’s recent interest rate cuts are helping to boost growth. Policymakers cut rates in August 2024 (from 5.25% to 5%), in November (to 4.75%) and again in February 2025 (to the current rate of 4.5%).

US March CPI

Thursday 10 April

Analysts estimate that US CPI rose 2.5% in the year to March, easing from 2.8% in February. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have increased 3% year-on-year, down from 3.1% in February. On a monthly basis, headline CPI is thought to have increased 0.2%, with core CPI up 0.3%.

On Friday, PPI is expected to come in at 3%, down from 3.2% in February. Analysts use the CPI and PPI readings to estimate the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the next reading of which is due out later this month.

Trump’s tariffs have changed the outlook for US inflation, which may be set to rise if importers pass on higher costs to consumers. Should the March inflation figures come in higher than expected, the inflation outlook could deteriorate even further. Implementing the tariffs on top of hot inflation data might raise fears of stagflation – a combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. In that scenario, the US dollar might continue to weaken, potentially benefiting the Japanese yen. Having broken below support at ¥147 on Thursday, USD/JPY could be on its way towards the next key support area near ¥142.

UK February GDP

Friday 11 April

After the UK economy unexpectedly shrank 0.1% month-on-month in January, down from a 0.4% increase in December, economists estimate that gross domestic product grew 0.1% in February. With growth tepid, and given that the market turmoil brought on by Trump’s tariffs could run into a second week, the GDP report may not significantly affect the pound.

The pound looks slightly overextended, with GBP/USD having tested resistance near $1.32 on Thursday before slipping back to $1.297. That said, if the pound benefits from further dollar weakness, the pair could strengthen back above $1.30. If GBP/USD clears $1.31, then $1.342 may become the next upside target.

JPMorgan Chase Q1 earnings

Friday 11 April

BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are among the US financial heavyweights kicking off a fresh US earnings season on Friday, but JPMorgan will be the one to watch. Analysts expect the largest US bank by assets to report that first-quarter earnings grew 3.7% year-on-year to $4.60 a share. Revenue is forecast to have increased 3.4% to $43.98bn. Looking ahead to Q2, analysts forecast earnings of $4.57 a share on revenue of $44bn. The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.

The JPMorgan share price closed at $228.69 on Thursday, down 18% from the February high, following a rocky few weeks. The chart below shows the emergence of a possible head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below support at $224 could confirm the pattern. If that support level breaks, the stock might slide to around $205.

Its earnings of $2.04 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the consensus estimate by 2%.
What disappointed investors the most was its underwhelming fiscal 2025 sales guidance.","Headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) researches and develops, manufactures, and sells various products in the healthcare field. Valued at a market cap of $385.1 billion, the company boasts a broad portfolio of drugs covering a wide range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular & metabolism, immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and infectious diseases and vaccines. It is expected to announce its fiscal Q1 earnings for 2025 before the market opens on Tuesday, Apr. 15.

The company has exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Its earnings of $2.04 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the consensus estimate by 2%.

For the full year, analysts expect JNJ to report EPS of $10.58, up 6% from $9.98 in fiscal 2024. Its EPS is expected to further grow 4.6% year over year to $11.07 in fiscal 2026.

JNJ has aligned with the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 3.6% gains over the past 52 weeks, although it has outpaced the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) marginal decline over the same time frame.

On Apr. 1, JNJ’s shares closed down 7.6% after a Texas bankruptcy judge dismissed the company's latest attempt to settle thousands of lawsuits. The lawsuits allege that J&J's baby powder and other talc-based products caused ovarian cancer. The court ruling was a major setback for the company, contributing to the sharp decline in its stock price.

On Jan. 22, JNJ released its Q4 results. It delivered adjusted EPS of $2.04 and revenue of $22.5 billion, which surpassed Wall Street estimates. Moreover, its revenue improved 5.3% from the year-ago quarter due to a rise in sales across both its reportable segments. Despite these positives, its shares plunged 1.9% on the day of the release. What disappointed investors the most was its underwhelming fiscal 2025 sales guidance. The company expects revenue in the range of $89.2 billion and $90 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates. Additionally, while its adjusted earnings exceeded expectations, it declined 10.9% compared to the prior-year quarter, further weighing on investor sentiment.

Wall Street analysts are moderately optimistic about JNJ’s stock, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating overall. Among 22 analysts covering the stock, eight recommend ""Strong Buy,"" two suggest “Moderate Buy,” and 12 advise “Hold.” The mean price target for JNJ is $169.18 which indicates a 5.9% potential upside from the current levels.

In September last year, Starbucks Chief Brian Niccol launched his ""Back to Starbucks"" campaign, which was slated to go into full swing in 2025, to counter declining sales and foot traffic at the renowned chain.

Ultimately, the Seattle-rooted coffee giant has expressed an eagerness to reclaim its reputation as the quintessential ""third place,"" a sanctuary aside from home and the office. Niccol proudly shared, ""I'm happy to say the third place is alive and well. It's as needed as it ever was.""

Perhaps the most notable change has been the menu updates. Last month, Starbucks told USA TODAY that it has revamped and scaled down its menu offerings to ""help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company.""

The company said it's trimming its menu by a whopping 30 percent. The initial phase of these reductions commenced in February. Starbucks clarified that the cuts would affect items that ""aren't commonly purchased, can be complex to make, or are similar to other beverages on the menu."" Choices like the Iced Matcha Lemonade, Java Chip Frappuccino, White Hot Chocolate and Honey Almondmilk Flat White were already cut.

Starbucks also said they are shaking things up with new store designs being trialed in various U.S. spots. ""We're working hard to ensure our coffee houses have the right vibe,"" Niccol said.

The coffee giant has reintroduced condiment bars, started serving drinks in ceramic mugs, and encouraged baristas to personalize cups with Sharpies. It's also broadened its free refill policy, now allowing more patrons to enjoy a second cup on the house than ever before.

Previously, only Starbucks Rewards members could snag a free refill, but that's changed. Now, any customer who orders a hot or iced coffee or tea for dine-in can request a refill during their visit at no extra cost at participating stores.

Earlier in the year, Starbucks revisited its restroom policy, now asking customers to purchase something before using the facilities or lounge in the café.

""Imagine coffee houses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays,"" Niccols envisioned.

He further explained: ""Stores with more separation between the café and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive handoff, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater to the experience and enhances the connection between our baristas and our customers.""

Niccol stated that the company also aims to deliver ""a high-quality beverage in four minutes or less with a moment of connection.""

In December 2024, Starbucks hinted at working on changes to make in-app and mobile orders more efficient, improving ""transparency and simplicity."" A few months later, Niccol announced that mobile ordering would now be limited to up to 12 items per order to decrease wait times.",https://i2-prod.irishstar.com/incoming/article34980843.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2196750077.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 14:10:33.359744

Starbucks India plans aggressive expansion of its store count despite facing losses since its entry into the market with Tata Group 12 years ago. The company focuses on various store formats and intends to strengthen its presence amid growing competition. Revenue growth has slowed down to 12% in FY24, while losses have tripled.

Starbucks India said it will aggressively expand their store count, despite running in losses. The coffee chain entered India 12 years ago with a joint venture with the Tata Group.

Sushant Dash, CEO, Starbucks India says ""We are focussing on store count expansion. And when you are doing that, it requires investment. And that has an impact on the bottom line.""

As of September 2024, the company has a new global CEO, Brian Niccol who took on the role after Laxman Narasimhan, who held the position since March 2023 and was replaced amid declining sales and stock prices, last September.

The current strategy of the company for India remains the same as it was under Narasimhan’s regime, Dash said. The company intends to continue to focus on arabica coffee, localized menus, store formats and store counts.

The total store count for the brand in India stands at 487. Out of these, 8 stores are drive-throughs. Majority of the drive-through stores for the brand are in Punjab.

Live Events

Dash adds, “India in terms of growth is amongst the top four markets for Starbucks, and we plan on increasing our store presence focusing on various store formats, like we have been doing.”

The coffee retail competition in India has been brewing steadily with UK based Pret A Manger entering India in April 2023, in a franchise agreement with Reliance Brands Limited, with plans to open 100 stores in five years.

Domestic competitor Third Wave Coffee crossed 100 outlets in India as of last year.

Starbucks India’s revenue growth slowed down to 12% in FY24, with revenue from operations at Rs 1,218.1 crore, and its losses increased three times at Rs 80 crore.

As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.
How Starbucks could weather the storm Indeed, the fear of a recession is one reason that Starbucks share prices sank yesterday, says Danilo Gargiulo, an equity research analyst for Bernstein.
In the 2008 crisis, he explains, Starbucks was one of the brands hardest hit by reduced consumer spending.","Since Brian Niccol took over as the CEO of Starbucks last fall, he has made a slew of moves to start bringing customers back to the company's stores and reverse slumping sales. He has vowed to reduce wait times for service, and he simplified the shop's menu, while encouraging in-store customers to linger over ceramic mugs.

But the top reason customers say they’re going to Starbucks less often is its high prices, according to recent research from Deutsche Bank analysts. And controlling prices may have just gotten a lot more difficult for Niccol.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, placing high taxes on imports from dozens of countries and a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S. The president hopes his drastic actions will nudge businesses to buy supplies from American producers and make products in the U.S.. For coffee retailers like Starbucks, however, the levies will be impossible to dodge given that less than 1% of coffee consumed in the country is made domestically.

Starbucks imports coffee from more than 30 countries, including Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariffs at 46%.

As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.

A price freeze promise

Starbucks did not respond to Fortune's request for comment. But the company's former CFO acknowledged in an earnings call earlier this year that higher prices for coffee could impact revenue and profitability for the retail giant and its “already pressured consumer.”

The coffee company has angered customers in recent years by steeply raising prices as inflation rose in the U.S. The chief executive has already assigned himself a challenging task: he plans to invest in stores and employees as part of his turnaround plan, but has also committed to a price freeze through fiscal year 2025. So what now?

“Starbucks is either going to have lower margins and keep the prices where they are, or they'll be forced to raise prices,” says Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.

If trade wars lead to steeper prices for a wide range of products, or push the U.S. into a recession, some Starbucks customers who currently pick up pricey drinks once or twice a week “may decide that they do not need that as much as they need to pay their rent or pay for health insurance,” Cohan adds. He predicts Starbucks will see fewer store visits, meaning lower sales of coffee, food, and non-coffee based drinks.

The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy.
The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.
While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive.
The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth.","According to a report from Moody’s, a global credit ratings, research, and risk analysis firm, Europe’s four largest primary insurers—Allianz, AXA, Generali, and Zurich Insurance —have reported record earnings for FY 2024, collectively reaching €28.6 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year.

Moody’s attributes these strong results to solid performances across all key divisions, with property and casualty (P&C) insurance and life and health (L&H) segments driving much of the growth.

The continued success in these sectors highlights the insurers’ robust positions in the market and their ability to navigate challenging economic environments.

The insurers demonstrated significant premium gains across both P&C and L&H sectors, with P&C premiums rising by 9% and L&H premiums increasing by 14%.

Moody’s emphasised that these increases were driven by price hikes and greater exposure, particularly in retail insurance. The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy. While the insurers exceeded their earnings targets for 2024, Moody’s expects slower profit growth in 2025, influenced by rising geopolitical risks and market uncertainties.

The P&C business was particularly strong in 2024, buoyed by both retail and commercial lines. Premium revenue, particularly in retail insurance, significantly boosted underwriting results, as insurers continued adjusting prices to respond to inflation in claims costs.

Allianz and Zurich were among those reporting improvements in their commercial combined ratios. Despite this, commercial pricing momentum showed some signs of slowing down, especially in certain markets. However, retail P&C lines saw significant improvement across most European regions.

Moody’s noted that the L&H business rebounded in 2024, showing growth after a slower 2023. This was driven by higher releases from the contractual service margin (CSM) and improved technical margins.

The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.

While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive. New business in the L&H sector grew by an average of 17% across the four companies, with Allianz and Generali seeing particularly strong results—up 20% and 30%, respectively. This growth was fuelled by a diverse mix of protection and savings products tailored to market demands.

According to Moody’s, the insurers reported stable solvency ratios, supported by strong capital generation. However, substantial shareholder returns, including dividends and share buybacks, partly offset these gains.

Despite a solid capital foundation, the insurers remain committed to progressive dividend policies, which may limit financial flexibility in times of economic stress. Moody’s also highlighted that their cautious outlook for capital management in 2025 could be influenced by rising geopolitical tensions and volatile financial markets.

Moody’s also pointed out the value of geographical diversification in strengthening these insurers’ positions. Allianz, AXA, and Generali have established dominant positions in their home markets (Germany, France, and Italy, respectively), while maintaining significant footprints across Europe and other regions.

Zurich, with its focus on P&C and commercial lines, has a strong presence in North America. This geographical spread has helped mitigate risks from natural catastrophes and has been instrumental in diversifying earnings.

While investment returns in 2024 were robust, buoyed by healthy interest rates and stable financial markets, the outlook for investment results in 2025 is more uncertain.

Moody’s indicated that rising geopolitical risks and potential market volatility could impact investment performance. The mixed outlook for investments is an area of concern as insurers must navigate broader market uncertainty, including potential economic slowdowns.

Looking ahead to 2025, Moody’s expects slower profit growth, though P&C performance is expected to continue benefiting from price increases and exposure growth.

However, the momentum in commercial pricing is likely to slow. The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth. In contrast, Allianz and Generali, with their focus on long-term life savings, appear better positioned for growth in this area.

Despite these challenges, Moody’s believes that the insurers remain well-positioned for further market share expansion. Their diverse portfolios, strong capital management, and geographical spread provide a solid foundation for the future.",https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/moodys-logo-new.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:22:13.287636

The 2024 financials, filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGx) on Monday, showed an impressive rise in the bank’s profit after tax which went up by 26.14 percent to close the year at US$514.476 million, up from US$ 407.836 million recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.

The Bank’s gross earnings also grew significantly from US$13,959 billion recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year to US$21,409 billion in the period under consideration, representing a 53.6 percent growth.

Like in the previous years, the banks’ total assets also rose remarkably by 46.8 percent, from US$133,312 trillion in 2023, to close at US$196, 256 trillion in December 2024; signifying a milestone leap for the bank with the largest spread across the continent.

As a result of the impressive performance and in fulfilment of the promise made by the UBA Group Chairman, Tony Elumelu, to shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting, the Bank proposed a final dividend of US$0.0019 for every ordinary share of US$ 0.0032, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024. This brings the total dividend in the year to US$0.0032 The final dividend is subject to the ratification of the shareholders during its upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).

UBA’s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Alawuba, who expressed excitement at the results, stated that the 2024 financial performance demonstrates the bank’s continued focus on driving earnings growth, preserving asset quality, expanding business operations and deepening market share.

“Our continued investment in our highly diversified global network allows UBA to deliver high-quality, consistent earnings. Our businesses have been able to grow product and service income and expand our deposit base, allowing the Group to increase earnings while maintaining strong spreads and margins,” Alawuba highlighted.

According to him, “With total deposit increasing by 42.03 percent from US$11,233.054 billion in 2023 to US$15.946 billion and total assets hitting US$19.626 billion from US$19.819 billion, the just-released results reflect broad-based growth across all core businesses and were achieved despite prevailing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainties, and exchange rate volatilities.”

The GMD expressed excitement at the marked improvement recorded in the bank’s core earnings profile, as he explained that the profit is derived from high-quality income streams from funding intermediation, fees, and commissions, thus reflecting strong long-term, sustainable revenue generation capacity.

“Our ex-Nigeria (Rest of Africa & International) operations have expanded significantly over the past five years, now contributing 51.7% of Group revenue, up from 31% in 2019, delivering diversification benefits and further boosting long-term shareholder value. This will continue to grow, as we further explore strategic markets that align with our overall vision. We are currently upgrading our business scope and authorization in France, and considering other viable markets in the short to medium term,” Alawuba noted.

He pointed out the bank’s resolve to invest continuously in technology, data analytics, product innovation, staff training and development, which, according to him, will collectively enhance our customers’ experience.

On his part, UBA’s Executive Director, Finance & Risk Management, Ugo Nwaghodoh, said the bank recorded triple-digit growth in net interest income, resulting in remarkable improvement in net interest margin from 6.83 percent in 2023 to 9.02 percent, while also recording strong double-digit growth in fee and commission income lines of 91.66 percent.

“UBA Group continues to demonstrate strong capital levels, with shareholders’ funds’ growth of 68.4% to US$2.208 billion and a solid capital adequacy ratio of 31.0%., and as we defensibly position the portfolio to navigate prevailing global and regional macroeconomic upheavals, asset quality improved, with NPL ratio moderating to 5.58%, with strong provision coverage at 81%”, Nwaghodoh noted.

This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt.
The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.","International Breweries has seen its loss after tax extended to the seventh year, as it recorded an N113bn loss in the 2024 financial year.

According to its audited financial report filed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited on Thursday, the brewer saw its loss worsen to N113.61bn from N70.03bn in 2023, marking a 62.25 per cent rise.

International Breweries had been on a losing streak since the 2018 financial year when it recorded a loss of N3.87bn, which grew to N27.79bn in 2019 and dipped to N16.08bn in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose to N17.66bn in 2021 and higher to N21.63bn in 2022.

However, in the 2024 financial year, the company’s revenue reached a nine-year high of N488.96bn. Compared to the previous year’s revenue of N260.59bn, this was an 87.63 per cent jump year-on-year, indicating strong revenue growth.

Highlighting some of its challenges, the brewer in its annual report said, “While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacted profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure.

The company generated positive operating cash flows in the current year, 2024: N148.90bn (2023: N78.60bn) to cover its short-term obligations. The company is strategically positioned for success in the future and continues to have the backing of its ultimate parent company.”

International Breweries opened its N588bn rights issue programme in May 2024. The brewer sought to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of two kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share. According to the rights issue circular, the terms include six new ordinary shares for every share held by existing shareholders.

It later expanded the offering to allow non-shareholders of the company to participate in its rights issue.

The brewer, which is a part of AB InBev, the largest brewer in the world, said at the time that the net proceeds from the rights issue would be used to settle its outstanding US dollar-denominated loan and provide working capital support.

“We are committed to creating sustainable value for our shareholders while fortifying our position in the Nigerian beverage industry. Together, we will continue to brew success, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and create a future with more cheers,” said Finance Director of International Breweries David Tomlinson.

Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller, then the world’s second-largest brewer, in 2016.

This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt. The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.

As of December 2024, AB InBev Nigeria Holdings BV holds 161,580,471,272, equating to 96.1 per cent of the shares of the brewer.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/12015234/International-Breweries-Plc.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 23:00:33.982297

“Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection.
“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email.
“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email.
“But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game.","Forever 21’s downfall cannot be attributed to a single factor. Yet, the once iconic fast fashion retailer pointedly singled out the rise of the likes of Shein and Temu as a key driver behind its second bankruptcy.

If you ask experts, however, the company’s demise isn’t a story of a sole misstep, but rather a series of interconnected failures, which, while including rising competition, also stemmed from an inability to adapt to the quick changing economic environment, trend cycles, and consumer shopping patterns.

The retailer, which will be closing all 350 of its stores in the US, had faced eerily similar woes during its first bankruptcy in 2019: overexpansion without a well thought-out strategy, an inability to keep up with digital trends, declining product appeal, and overall concerns around sustainability.

But instead of addressing its core problems, modernizing operations, or significantly improving its e-commerce presence like its competitors Zara and H&M, it simply downsized and, well…hoped for the best.

“In the case of Forever 21, the reasons given by management were all known at the time of their first bankruptcy,” Greg Portell, senior partner and global markets lead at Kearney, told Retail Brew via email. “Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection. In the end, any company should expect competition and can benefit from working to anticipate those moves.”

Cue the sequel: Denise Green, director of graduate studies in Cornell University’s fiber science and apparel design program, pointed to the significant struggles the retailer had on the sustainability front—a mounting concern that has put all fast fashion brands under scrutiny.

While retailers like Zara and H&M have focused on increasing awareness around their sustainability efforts, however flawed, Forever 21 seemed to have paid very little heed to its low-cost, disposable model. It doesn’t help that mid-priced brands such as Reformation and Everlane also gained traction at the same time by offering more ethically produced alternatives.

“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email. “The company’s overexpansion and inefficient supply chain further exacerbated its financial woes.”

Ironically, Shein and Temu have faced even greater scrutiny over their ethics and sustainability practices, yet that hasn’t deterred their loyal customer base from the vast selection of ultra-cheap offerings on both platforms.

“Retailers like Shein and Temu pose a significant threat because of their more agile supply chains, which enable rapid response to consumer trends and their shifting preferences,” Green said. “Competing against them requires a multifaceted approach: investing in technology to equalize supply chain agility, prioritizing sustainability, and enhancing brand loyalty through storytelling and personalization.”

Sam Vise, CEO of Optimum Retailing, an AI-supported retail intelligence platform, offers an alternate point of view. While acknowledging that Shein and Temu pose a real threat to fast fashion brands, he said it’s not because of their “speed or low prices” but because of a unique understanding of their customer.

“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email. “But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game. The key is not to try and outprice Shein or Temu online; it’s to offer something they fundamentally can’t. When done right, brick-and-mortar stores create an emotionally resonant experience that can’t be replicated while scrolling on an app.”

Final word: Vise suggests the “real opportunity” to tackle the threat from the duo lies in combining the strengths of both digital and physical retail.

“The retailers that will thrive are the ones who view their physical footprint as a strategic advantage: a space where online meets offline, and where shoppers can see, feel, try, and immediately take home the products they’ve browsed digitally,” he said. “To stay competitive, traditional fast fashion brands need to reframe their stores not as distribution points, but as experience centers that are flexible, localized, and deeply in tune with the customer.”

If there’s one takeaway from Forever 21’s decline, it’s that survival in retail isn’t about sticking to what worked in the past, it’s about evolving.

The marketplace’s share within that has nearly doubled in just one year. The platform serves as a catalyst for growth for Decathlon, both in Germany and beyond.

Globally, Decathlon achieved a revenue of 16.2 billion euros last year. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 3.8 percent increase compared to the previous year.

Online revenue

Digital sales are becoming increasingly important for the French sporting goods retailer. Last year, 20 percent of its global revenue came from online sales, including ecommerce, in-store connected orders, and marketplaces – up from 17 percent in 2023. In Germany, however, the online share is significantly higher.

Decathlon sells billions of euros worth of products online

In its reports, Decathlon also emphasizes its focus on the importance of the planet and people. Despite sales growth, the company reduced its CO2 emissions last year. Additionally, it continues to employ more people, now with staff from 87 different nationalities. The proportion of women in the workforce has also increased.

Omnichannel strategy and marketplace

In a separate report on Germany, Decathlon attributes its positive revenue development to “the consistent implementation of its omnichannel strategy, which seamlessly integrates the digital and physical shopping experience”. The company also highlights “the remarkable development of the online marketplace”, which accounted for 20 percent of digital sales last year. For comparison: in 2023, this was 11 percent, and in 2022, just 7 percent.

German marketplace share has tripled since 2022

Given that Decathlon’s German marketplace has not been active for very long, its rapid growth is not surprising. However, platform sales are exceeding expectations. It has become a catalyst for further profitable online growth, much like what has been seen with online marketplaces of MediaMarkt, Zalando and Otto.

Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.","At the Shoptalk retail industry conference last week, Gap Inc CEO Richard Dickson touted the apparel maker's limited exposure to China and the tariffs about to be imposed on imports from there after years of efforts to diversify its supplier base.

""Big credit goes to our supply chains. We've been working on diversifying our manufacturer footprint for quite some time. Less than 10% of our product is coming out of China,"" said Dickson. Now Gap's biggest supplier country is Vietnam, followed by India and Indonesia, all well ahead of China.

Dickson's counterpart at Levi Strauss & Co Michelle Gass echoed the reduced exposure to China at Shoptalk too, saying ""Of what we know today, right now it is fairly minimal.""

In recent years, many U.S. apparel makers have gradually reduced their reliance on China because of rising costs there, the abundance of capacity in Southeast Asia, and the threat of a trade conflict with the U.S. always looming.

But Dickson and Gass' sanguine reactions of course came before the Trump Administration's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to impose punitive tariffs on 60 countries, including across-the-board levies of 46% on imports from Vietnam and 26% from India. Suddenly, Gap Inc and Levi's don't seem inoculated at all from Trump's tariff war with the rest of the world.

Gap Inc shares were down 22% in early trading on Thursday, while Levi's were down 11%. Other apparel-heavy retailers saw big drops like Macy's, down 16%. (Home goods retailers, also very exposed to tariffs on Asian suppliers, similarly got dinged, with Restoration Hardware down 42%.)

When President Trump this winter announced his first salvos in the tariff wars, focused initially on China, Canada and Mexico, many retailers rushed to reassure investors that over time, they had lessened their exposure to China, long known as a maker of cheap items for Western brands. Target's Chief Commercial Officer said in March that Chinese goods now represent 30% of its merchandise, down from 60% in 2017. Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.

Ditto for Nike, which said in its most recent annual report that factories in Vietnam made half of the shoes it sells and more than a quarter of the apparel in Vietnam. The sportswear giant, trying to carry off a turnaround amid waning interest in its wares, saw its shares fall 15%.

Walmart, Best Buy, and other major retailers are already feeling the impact of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which are set to take effect April 9. The initial 10% tariff will kick in this Saturday, April 5.

Other retailers, including Dollar General (DG+4.65%), Dollar Tree (DLTR-12.09%), Target (TGT-11.31%), and Best Buy (BBY-17.62%), are also taking a hit. Suffering the most damage thus far is Five Below (FIVE-26.62%), whose shares plummeted over 20%, and Best Buy, which saw a nearly 12% drop. Retailers are bracing for the fallout, with many executives warning that rising costs could push prices higher for consumers.

Retail giants like Walmart, Costco, and Target are reportedly racing to shift the tariff burden onto their Chinese suppliers, a move that could help them absorb some of the financial pressure. However, suppliers operating on razor-thin margins may pass those costs back to U.S. companies, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers on everyday items like fruits, vegetables, electronics, and apparel.

Walmart (WMT-2.91%), Best Buy, and Target have already indicated they may raise prices should tariffs take effect. The National Retail Federation (NRF) recently issued a warning, projecting a slowdown in consumer spending for 2025 if tariffs continue to escalate. Both Gregory Daco, EY’s chief economist, and Sarah Wolfe, Morgan Stanley’s (MS-9.63%) senior economist and strategist, expressed concerns that higher-than-expected tariff could increase everyday costs, putting a strain on household budgets and dampening consumer demand.

New tariffs from the Trump administration, slapping a 10% base rate on imports, are rattling the retail sector, hitting giants like Best Buy and home-furnishing firms hard.

What does this mean?

These tariffs, set to impact imports from China, Japan, and other countries, are creating a tough environment for retailers reliant on imported goods. Best Buy, which focuses on import-driven, big-ticket items, saw its shares dive 15% following the announcement, while Wayfair, RH, Williams-Sonoma, and Arhaus took even bigger hits. RH plans to work with manufacturers to soften the effect on margins after missing fiscal targets. Conversely, Williams-Sonoma stays optimistic, expecting limited macroeconomic effects. Experts suggest consumers might absorb some cost hikes, as vendors are likely to pass some tariff expenses onto retailers.

Why should I care?

The bigger picture: Retail reshuffling on the rise.

While hardline retailers struggle with tariff impacts, those less reliant on imports like Chewy and Petco Health and Wellness, along with auto parts retailers like AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive, appear more resilient. Their focus on essential items and pricing power could help them weather the changing trade landscape, highlighting a broader market shift towards resilience against import volatility.

For markets: The import-export debate.

The tariffs' introduction has injected uncertainty into market dynamics, affecting investor confidence and share values. Some retailers may try cost-cutting and pricing tactics, but the overall impact on consumer spending and economic sentiment is still up in the air. As markets adjust, analysts continue to evaluate how these tariffs will affect purchasing power and sector growth in the coming months.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-x4W9QLyc66CJ8JgoIJ06tf8D.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=6844e19748ee6c1e03880a9935af03b9,N,,2025-04-03 15:10:11.716457

More promisingly, Amsa is cautiously optimistic about green shoots in demand — particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, where state and private projects could revive appetite for long steel products.","ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa) this week announced a six-month deferral of the planned wind-down of its Long Steel Business, extending operations until at least 31 August 2025 and preventing the loss of at least 3,500 direct jobs, for now.

The lifeline is not a Band-Aid nor yet a permanent solution, with Amsa stating: “The facility is repayable subject to agreement between the parties and contingent on the financial performance, solvency and liquidity of the Long Steel Business,” in a press release.

This development follows a R1.683-billion facility provided by the Industrial Development Corporation, aimed at sustaining the business while seeking long-term solutions to a proposed business dissolution that would have seen South Africa’s longest-running steel producer close down, with thousands of jobs on the line.

Long steel long in the tooth

The long steel business — Amsa’s division focused on the production of fencing material, rail, rods, and bars — serves as a vital supplier to the construction, mining, and manufacturing sectors, with core operations centred in Newcastle and Vereeniging.

While its products form the literal backbone of infrastructure development, the business has struggled to remain standing, in large part due to the broader infrastructure challenges within the country regarding entities such as the Passenger Rail Association of South Africa (Prasa) and Transnet.

By end 2024 operational losses at the Longs division had doubled to R1.1-billion, and for Amsa overall, headline losses topped R5.1-billion — reflecting an unsustainable combination of sluggish domestic demand, punishing electricity tariffs, inefficient rail logistics, and pressure from smaller, nimbler mini-mill competitors.

The wind-down

In November 2023 Amsa announced its intention to shutter long steel operations by April 2025, citing persistent losses and an absence of favourable policy concessions; the company had signalled that it could no longer absorb the unit’s cash burn.

But in a turn of events on Monday, 31 March 2025, Amsa confirmed that the Industrial Development Corporation had stepped in with a R1.683-billion funding facility, halting the shutdown — at least for now.

The Industrial Development Corporation facility is repayable based on the solvency, liquidity, and financial performance of the Long Steel Business, and buys Amsa six more months to stabilise operations and negotiate longer-term reforms.

Government and stakeholder involvement

The deferral forms part of a broader emergency rescue framework involving government ministries, regulators, and key stakeholders. Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau has committed to addressing long-standing structural challenges in the steel sector.

These include a reform of the scrap metal Preferential Pricing System, revisions to the scrap export tax, and the introduction of safeguard tariffs to shield domestic producers from low-cost imports.

To ease pressure on Amsa’s balance sheet, the company has also secured Temporary Employee Relief Scheme funding to offset payroll costs during the deferral window. In response, Amsa has suspended the Section 189(3) retrenchment consultations, offering a temporary reprieve to thousands of workers.

In a joint effort with the Industrial Development Corporation, government representatives have said the deferral period would be used to address “structural problems previously identified by the company”, with the goal of placing the Long Steel Business on a more sustainable footing.

Industrial Development Corporation in to save the day

The Industrial Development Corporation’s support may extend beyond this immediate bailout. The state-owned financier, which already holds a 6.4% stake in Amsa, has signalled its interest in increasing its shareholding. CEO Kobus Verster confirmed that a due diligence process was now under way in a media briefing earlier today: “The Industrial Development Corporation has indicated that they have a desire to look at an increased shareholding, and for that, a due diligence period has been agreed upon.”

Jobs on the line

The decision to keep Amsa’s long steel operations running preserves about 3,500 direct and indirect jobs that would have been lost in the event of a shutdown. But even with this intervention, the sustainability of those jobs hinges on deeper reforms.

South Africa’s steel value chain — critical to sectors such as construction, mining, and automotive manufacturing — relies heavily on long product availability. Any disruption risks ripple effects across the broader economy. The deferral provides breathing room to maintain that supply while systemic fixes are pursued, but should these not be resolved, it’s unclear how similar challenges will be avoided for the Industrial Development Corporation in the future.

The industry’s long-term mettle

Despite the temporary fix, fundamental issues — aging infrastructure, low cost competitiveness, and regulatory burden — require more than financial stopgaps. Without major industrial reform, the Long Steel Business could merely be delaying the inevitable.

Protective tariffs have been inconsistently applied, and regulatory interventions have often come too late to be effective. The scrap Preferential Pricing System, in particular, has been blamed for distorting market prices and advantaging recyclers over primary producers like Amsa.

During the deferral period, Amsa will explore strategic alternatives to turn the business around. These include operational efficiency programmes, modernising production processes, expanding the product range, and deepening supplier and customer collaboration.

Strained Consumer Spending

General Mills, Kraft Heinz and Campbell's have all issued bleak annual forecasts on strained consumer spending, which took a further hit after US President Donald Trump's erratic tariff decisions fanned worries of prices shooting up again.

Digital sales now represent 20 percent of total revenue, including e-commerce, marketplaces and in-store connected orders.

Decathlon said it “reinforced its commitment to empower people to lead healthier, more active lives in 2024.”

“A year after unveiling its new ambition and strategy as well as its global brand identity, Decathlon has undergone a transformative journey, evolving as a multi-specialist sports brand that inspires everyone — from beginners to Olympic and Paralympic athletes — to embrace the power of sport, the company said in a media release.

The company said this transformation is underway, with 200 stores either newly opened or modernized, alongside an optimized brand portfolio to offer greater clarity and better serve its customers.

Decathlon expects, by 2026, to restructure 90 percent of its product offerings.

Rigorous cost-control measures reportedly mitigated the impact of cost inflation, allowing Decathlon to maintain its commercial momentum while ensuring affordable prices. Optimizing operational expenses remains a key priority for 2025 to support long-term growth.

Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.
Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger.
He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.
Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value.
“Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint.","Kroger Co. spent more than a billion dollars on the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, detailed those expenses in its newly released Form 10-K filed April 1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kroger officials said the company spent $1.044 billion in merger-related expenses dating back to 2022. The majority of those, $684 million, were incurred in fiscal 2024, which ended Feb. 1, 2025. Those costs followed $316 million in fiscal 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger. The deal would have combined the nation’s second-largest operator of traditional supermarkets in Albertsons with Kroger. It would have been the largest merger involving U.S. supermarkets in history and combined Kroger’s 2,722 stores with Albertsons’ 2,271 stores to create a national behemoth.

But regulators and state attorneys general opposed the acquisition and merger on antitrust grounds. They believed the combination would be anticompetitive in many markets. The Federal Trade Commission sued in February 2024 to block it and multiple state attorneys general sued to halt the acquisition. All cited antitrust factors.

A federal court judge sided with the FTC in ruling Dec. 10, 2024, to halt the deal and a Washington state court judge issued a similar ruling the same day. Albertsons and Kroger separately called off the transaction the next day.

Albertsons also sued Kroger Dec. 11 for breach of the merger agreement.

Through it all, Kroger spent that $1 billion-plus largely on third-party professional fees and credit facility fees, Kroger officials said in the filing. Those likely consist largely of attorney fees and costs related to Kroger’s issuance of $10.5 billion in debt in August to pay for the acquisition. Kroger later used much of that money to buy back $7.5 billion in stock.

Kroger officials didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Analysts largely said merger-related charges like that, even when they’re for a deal that ultimately didn’t happen, are the price companies pay for doing business.

“These expenses are generally viewed as the cost of doing business and investors tend to look through these one-time costs,” Johnson Investment Counsel Senior Research Analyst Joe Abbott told me.

He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.

“In other words, the acquisition-related expenses would have been more than paid for by the long-term value created by the combined entity,” Abbott said.

Kevin Gade, chief operating officer and portfolio manager at downtown-based Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said Kroger has been able to overcome those costs that ultimately didn’t pay off.

“I would categorize it as a stranded cost that is likely to get no return on that time or money spent unless Kroger pursues Albertsons again imminently,” Gade said. “Kroger has been an excellent investment since the deal was officially called off in December. So while absorbing stranded costs is painful, the market was skeptical on this deal.”

Indeed, Kroger shares have gained 16% since the market closed Dec. 9, the day before the court rulings against the deal were issued. Kroger stock gained 4 cents Wednesday to close April 2 at $67.27.

But James Lewis, portfolio manager and senior equity research analyst at Bartlett Wealth Management, said the costs are higher than those incurred in most deals. Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value. Kroger’s costs are at the high end of that range, he said.

“One factor to consider is the complexity of the deal,” Lewis said. “Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint. Regulatory hurdles were high. Deals involving companies in unrelated industries typically have lower acquisition costs since the transaction does not undergo strict regulatory oversight.”

Kroger is certain to incur even more costs. Albertsons is suing it to collect a $600 million termination fee. C&S Wholesale Grocers, which agreed to buy 579 stores that Kroger planned to divest in order to appease regulators, also is suing Kroger to collect a $125 million termination fee.

Whether Kroger ends up paying those fees, settling for lower amounts or wins, it’ll incur further attorney and legal fees in the process.

The Albertsons acquisition's termination also was closely followed by fallout in Kroger’s C-suite. CEO and Chairman Rodney McMullen resigned March 2 following a Kroger board investigation of his personal conduct that, while ""unrelated to the business, was inconsistent with Kroger’s Policy on Business Ethics,” the company said in a news release. No other details have been released. Lead director Ron Sargent was named interim CEO and chairman.

Elsewhere in the 10-K filing, Kroger lists 14 risk factors that could affect its business. All companies list risks to the business. While the list is quite comprehensive and largely reflects similar risks to a year ago, one factor on last year’s list is missing this year: “Our proposed transaction with Albertsons creates incremental business, regulatory and reputational risks.”

Another change among risk factors this year is the presence of tariffs as a concern. Kroger lists tariffs as risks under the fuel, economic conditions and supply chains categories. As it relates to Kroger’s fuel sales, the company noted it can’t predict the cost and availability of fuel and how customers will react, possibly due to tariffs among other factors.

Tariffs also are viewed as creating uncertainty regarding future economic conditions. And tariffs could hurt Kroger’s business by interrupting its product supply, the company said. The word “tariff” didn’t appear among risk factors a year ago.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12935048/kroger-building-4*1200xx3600-2025-0-188.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 14:07:06.539758

For the third consecutive year, the French sporting goods retailer reported decoupling revenue growth from absolute carbon emissions.","Decathlon Group realised revenue growth in fiscal year 2024. The French sporting goods retailer critically examined its expenditures that year, limiting the impact of cost inflation. Optimising operational costs remains a priority for the coming fiscal year to support long-term growth, according to the filed annual report.

Decathlon operates in 79 countries with 1,817 stores and achieved a 5.2 percent year-over-year revenue increase in 2024 at constant exchange rates. Turnover reached 16.2 billion euros, with 20 percent generated through digital sales, encompassing e-commerce, marketplaces, and in-store orders. The French retailer's net profit amounted to 787 million euros.

One of the highlights of the fiscal year, ending December 31, 2024, was Decathlon's partnership with the Paris Olympic Games. This resulted in the sale of 1.8 million licensed products throughout the year. The collaboration also led to a 10 percent increase in store visits across France during the Olympic Games and a 6.7 percent increase during the Paralympic Games, according to the report.

In 2024, Decathlon also launched Decathlon Pulse, a subsidiary established to explore new frontiers and drive additional long-term growth through strategic investments and partnerships.

Decathlon anticipates continued future growth. Over the next five years, the company plans to expand its store count and production capabilities in India with a 100 million investment euros. The French retailer also sees opportunities in Germany: By 2027, the company aims to invest 100 million euros in the opening of new stores and modernising existing locations.

For the third consecutive year, the French sporting goods retailer reported decoupling revenue growth from absolute carbon emissions.

Visit the Investor site at RH.com to read the complete Shareholder Letter from Chairman & CEO, who communicates more in depth information about the business environment and expectations looking back and moving forward.

OUTLOOK

Based on our current plans and the uncertain macroeconomic environment we are providing the following financial outlook for the full year and first quarter.

Fiscal Year 2025

Revenue Growth of 10% to 13%

Adjusted Operating Margin of 14% to 15%

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 20% to 21%

First Quarter 2025

Revenue Growth of 12.5% to 13.5% Adjusted Operating Margin of 6.5% to 7.0%

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 12.5% to 13.0%

The above outlook includes a negative 160 to 200 basis point Operating Margin impact from investments and startup costs to support our international expansion.

Our Product Transformation Plans for 2025 include:

The introduction of our new RH Outdoor Sourcebook, featuring the most dominant assortment of high-quality outdoor furniture in the world arrived in homes early February with eight new furniture collections, an exciting new textiles offering, plus a significantly improved in-stock position to start the season versus a year ago.

The introduction of our new RH Interiors Sourcebook arrived in homes mid-February though early March, featuring 42 new collections across furniture, upholstery, lighting, rugs and textiles, as well as an additional 15 new collections launched on RH.com. While we had planned a higher amount of new collections for this book, due to the rapidly changing economic outlook, we believed it was prudent to delay some of our introductions until later in the year.

The launch of a significant new brand extension in the Fall of 2025 that we believe will meaningfully expand the market size and share of the RH brand. This new brand extension will include a new Sourcebook, a significant website presence and two freestanding Galleries dedicated to the New Concept. Our plan includes integrating RH Couture Upholstery by Dmitriy & Co. and RH Bespoke Furniture by Joseph Jeup into this new brand extension, enabling greater exposure and market reach versus standalone concepts. We will be sharing more details of this exciting new venture during our first quarter earnings call.

As communicated last quarter, we do not expect a negative impact to results related to previously announced increased tariffs on products from China, Canada or Mexico. As it relates to reciprocal and other tariffs that will be announced today, as we’ve done with prior tariffs, we will be working with our manufacturing partners to mitigate the impact to both our margins and costs to our customers.

We believe it is also important to note that we have been manufacturing upholstered furniture in our own North Carolina factory for over ten years, and have recently expanded the facility, doubling our capacity. We are currently projecting that 48% of our upholstered furniture will be produced in the U.S., 21% of our upholstered furniture will be produced in Italy, and 14% of our total business will be produced in the U.S. by the end of this year.

Now let me shift your attention to the expansion of our platform.

PLATFORM EXPANSION

We continue to open the most inspiring and immersive physical experiences in our industry, and some would say the world. Spaces that are a reflection of human design, a study of balance, symmetry and perfect proportions. Spaces that blur the lines between residential and retail, indoors and outdoors, home and hospitality. Spaces with garden courtyards, rooftop restaurants, wine and barista bars. Spaces that activate all of the senses, and spaces that cannot be replicated online.

Our plan to expand the RH brand globally, address new markets locally, and transform our North American Galleries represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

Our Platform Expansion Plans for 2025 include:

The opening of 7 Design Galleries, 2 Outdoor Galleries, plus 2 New Concept Galleries.

The seven new Design Galleries are: RH Oklahoma City, The Gallery at the Oak and RH Montreal, The Gallery at Royalmount, both opening in the first half of this year. RH Paris, The Gallery on the Champs-Élysées, RH Detroit, The Gallery in Birmingham, RH Manhasset, The Gallery at the Americana, RH San Diego, The Gallery at University Town Center, and RH Palm Desert, The Gallery on El Paseo, are all opening in the second half of this year.

Additionally, we plan to expand our brand presence in Greenwich, Connecticut, by developing a multi-building RH Design Ecosystem inclusive of the existing RH Gallery at the Historic Post Office, a freestanding RH Outdoor Gallery that opened last month, plus a New Concept Gallery in the former Ralph Lauren building on Greenwich Avenue opening in the second half of this year.

We also plan to expand our brand presence in East Hampton this Summer by opening a freestanding RH Outdoor Gallery and are exploring plans to further enhance our Design Ecosystem with a New Concept Gallery in the near future.

As previously communicated, we anticipate an inflection of our business in Europe as we begin to open in the important brand building markets of Paris in 2025, plus London and Milan in 2026, all with dramatic and brand building hospitality experiences. We believe post each opening we will begin to have the scale to support the necessary advertising investments to accelerate our growth in Europe.",http://hfbusiness.com/portals/0/logo_HFB_fb1.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 22:59:25.646722

The country is the largest textile exporter in the world, supplying apparel and footwear companies with tons of inventory.
Companies like Nike increasingly rely on Vietnam and Indonesia, which now face 46% and 32% tariffs.
It’s not just apparel makers that will be affected.
Following Trump’s announcement, which happened minutes after markets closed, share prices for Nike, Lululemon, Gap and other apparel makers tumbled.","President Donald Trump announced baseline tariffs of 10% on all imported goods on Wednesday, as well as higher ones against products imported from Asian countries that will negatively affect apparel makers like Oregon-based Nike and department stores like Seattle-headquartered Nordstrom.

China, which already had a 20% tariff levied on its exports, faces an additional 34% after Trump’s announcement. The country is the largest textile exporter in the world, supplying apparel and footwear companies with tons of inventory.

But other countries have become huge sources. Companies like Nike increasingly rely on Vietnam and Indonesia, which now face 46% and 32% tariffs.

While announcing the “reciprocal” tariff plan, Trump repeated messages from the campaign trail that sweeping tariffs would eventually bring manufacturing and other jobs back to the U.S. Shifting production strategies may not be likely or even wise for retail companies, however, leaving them in an awkward and perhaps painful spot.

“There’s nothing they can do in the short term,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar. “And realistically they won’t do anything because nobody knows how long these tariffs will last.”

Companies like Nike and Lululemon have contracts with suppliers in Vietnam and China. Contracts they can’t get out of or get around easily.

It’s not just apparel makers that will be affected. Department stores like Nordstrom are vulnerable to rising costs as well, Swartz said.

Retailers, which have struggled recently, may not weather a trade war as easily as Nike with its cash reserves or Lululemon, which might not see a decrease in demand with higher prices. Even in a strong economy, traditional retailers haven’t generated strong revenue growth.

“Most of what Nordstrom and other retailers sell is imported and that’s not going to change,” Swartz said. “Their biggest hope is that tariffs won’t last long. If they last for two months, the companies will survive. If tariffs last for a couple of years, they’ll get worried.”

Swartz said Nordstrom doesn’t have the pricing power of other retailers, meaning it could also be squeezed by rising costs and lose demand. Nordstrom’s discount Rack stores are popular, but if it has to pass off import costs to customers it could drive business to stores like Marshall’s that buy inventory already in the U.S.

But despite that, Swartz said Nordstrom will be able to get through trade turmoil. It’s about to be taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group through a $6.25 billion deal, which will keep it away from the scrutiny of Wall Street.

Following Trump’s announcement, which happened minutes after markets closed, share prices for Nike, Lululemon, Gap and other apparel makers tumbled.

Yeah, Josh, looking uh, ugly here in the after hours. Walmart stock down over four, uh, 4%. Amazon stock getting slammed, close to 5%. You just lock in on, uh, Walmart, for example. This is a company that gets about 70% of its cost of goods sold, AKA merchandise, from China. Sure, they have a big grocery business, but a lot of the, uh, apparel, sneakers, belts, you name it, they get that stuff from China. And of course, Amazon, uh, relying its marketplace sellers rely on China and the European Union. You heard the reporting there from Jen, European Union going to get slapped with a 20% tariff. China, 34%. That could cause marketplace sellers to raise prices pretty soon. That could also mean a demand pullback, potentially not good holiday shopping seasons for both of those names. But I'm holding up my Air Jordans sneaker here, guys, because before this segment, I'm like, where the hell did this sneaker come from? Guess what? It's made in China. Uh, and that's why you're seeing Nike shares down over 6% on this news. A lot of pressure, uh, on Nike. Now, they have also, uh, diversified. They're not alone, diversifying, uh, into Vietnam. Well, guess what? Vietnam, they get, uh, hit with the tariff of 46%. So all those retail executives that have told me and been very excited about, well, we, we're moving to Vietnam, we're going to try to save costs. Well, no luck. Uh, you were relying on Vietnam, you're going to get taxed a lot more. You're probably going to have to push through price increases. This is a big negative development for the apparel, uh, sneaker, and handbag industry, guys. Again, this Nike shoe and pretty much all of them are made in China.

While credit deterioration is not yet a major concern, there may be macro-driven reserve builds as banks adjust for downside risks, analysts added.

Strong trading revenues could drive upside to their earnings estimates, with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs seen as best positioned to outperform expectations.

JPMorgan

The analysts raised their Q1 earnings per share estimate for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM, ETR:CMC) to $4.71 from $4.58, above the $4.57 consensus, citing strong trading and investment banking revenues.

CEO Jamie Dimon’s commentary on the macroeconomic environment and regulatory landscape will be closely watched.

The bank’s full-year 2025 net interest income (ex-markets) guidance of $90 billion is seen as defensible in the absence of rapid rate cuts.

The analysts believe that the stock’s valuation may not be attractive enough for management to increase buybacks, which are currently assumed at around 100% total payout.

Goldman Sachs

The analysts also raised their Q1 EPS estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS, ETR:GOS) to $12.98 from $12.25, exceeding the $12.52 consensus.

While tougher trading and M&A advisory comparisons against JPMorgan and peers may temper growth, the potential for a headline earnings beat remains, driven by strong markets revenue, Bank of America believes.

Wells Fargo

The analysts downwardly revised their Q1 EPS forecast for Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC, ETR:NWT) to $1.17 from $1.23, versus the $1.24 consensus but noted the stock “remains a top idea for us.”

They attributed this to a conservative fee forecast despite expectations for a trading rebound to approximately $1.4 billion quarter-over-quarter.

Investment banking may benefit from market share gains, but equity gains are expected to drop off significantly after a strong $715 million performance in Q4 2024.

The key issue for Wells Fargo remains the ongoing asset cap imposed by regulators, which continues to limit growth potential. “[Wells Fargo] needs asset-cap removed to clear the decks for both management and the Street to reframe the risk/reward,” analysts wrote.

Citigroup

The analysts raised their Q1 EPS estimate for Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) to $1.86 from $1.83, slightly below the $1.89 consensus.

“While results may not be a catalyst, these could serve as a clearing event into the June stress test results where we expect Citi to see some capital relief,” they wrote.

The pace of buybacks remains a key focus, with analysts assuming $1.5 billion in repurchases for Q2 2025, ramping up to $3 billion per quarter in the second half of the year.

Citigroup’s ability to defend its pre-provision net revenue against a weaker revenue environment will also be closely watched.

Morgan Stanley

For Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), the analysts reduced their Q1 EPS estimate to $2.23 from $2.24, below the $2.29 consensus, which includes approximately $150 million of drag related to severance charges.

“Equities trading strength and lagged impact on wealth from market weakness (more a Q2 event) should combine for a strong Q1 2025,” they believe.

Investors will closely monitor net new asset growth, which has averaged several billion dollars per quarter over the past year, as a key indicator of future acceleration, the analysts added.

This article Levi's Q1 To See EPS Growth, Revenue Dip, And Tariff Edge, Says Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com © 2025 Benzinga.com.","Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey reiterated an Outperform rating on Wednesday on the shares of Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) with an unchanged price forecast of $23.00.

LEVI is set to release its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on April 7 after market close. The analyst expects EPS of $0.28, up from $0.26 last year, aligning with consensus estimates.

Revenue is projected to decline 1.3% year-over-year to $1.537 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $1.542 billion. Growth of 1% is anticipated in the Americas and Other Brands segments, while Europe and Asia are expected to see declines of 2% and 7%, respectively.

Gross margin is estimated to improve by 180 basis points to 60.0%, slightly exceeding the 59.9% consensus. Operating margin is expected to reach 10.4%, up from 9.0% last year, and in line with consensus projections.

For fiscal 2025, the company expects reported revenue to decline by 1%-2% from $6.355 billion in FY24, while organic revenue is projected to grow 3.5%-4.5%.

Levi expects FY25 EPS between $1.20-$1.25, aligning with or slightly below last year’s $1.25, while consensus estimates predict EPS of $1.25 with a 1% revenue decline.

LEVI sees tariffs as a potential competitive advantage. The company sources from over 25 countries, with less than 1% of imports coming from China, down from historical levels of 15%-16% and about 5% from Mexico, said the analyst.

Since most production in China and India is for local markets, the recently imposed 25% tariffs in 2025 are expected to have minimal impact.

LEVI rebounded in fourth-quarter FY24 with strong revenue growth after missing expectations in the second and third-quarter. All regions and channels saw notable sequential improvements, with record gross margins achieved without increased promotions.

Looking ahead, the company’s FY25 guidance remains conservative, with lower-than-expected revenue and EPS forecasts, partly due to FX headwinds. Meanwhile, EBIT margin projections offer upside potential.

Levi’s remains well-positioned long-term, benefiting from a stabilizing U.S. denim market, growing direct-to-consumer sales, and product innovation, noted the analyst.

The company has streamlined operations in FY25 by exiting non-core businesses, including Denizen and European footwear, while preparing to sell Dockers. This shift aims to enhance profitability and reduce revenue volatility.

Price Action: LEVI shares traded higher by 1.89% at $16.69 at last check Wednesday.

Albertsons is set to unveil its full-year earnings forecast, expected to align with Wall Street's expectations, as analyzed by Oppenheimer.

What does this mean?

Projections indicate Albertsons will stick to Oppenheimer's forecast of $2.30 per share for fiscal 2025, closely matching the $2.31 consensus from FactSet. The grocer's strategic plan to save $1.5 billion over three years highlights its focus on customer value and reinvesting in growth, with all first-year savings slated for reinvestment. Challenges such as lower adjusted gross margins from increased pharmacy sales and delivery costs persist, yet Albertsons is determined to hit its fiscal targets. With its traditionally cautious approach to guidance expected to continue, investors are showing increased optimism thanks to strong grocery trends and reduced tariff threats.

Why should I care?

For markets: Banking on the basics.

Investor interest in dedicated grocery retailers like Albertsons is growing, driven by stable grocery sector trends and easing tariff tensions. As Albertsons prepares to report its fourth-quarter results on April 15, there's anticipation of at least $0.41 earnings per share, fueled by 2% identical sales growth led by pharmacy benefits and food inflation.

“Construction spending rebounded in February, following widespread severe weather that may have slowed projects in January,” said Simonson.
""I expect substantial additional spending on highway and rail projects, and possibly broadband internet buildout in poorly connected areas,” Simonson said.
For example, public nonresidential construction spending jumped 6.1% compared to last February.
Meanwhile, private nonresidential spending hasn’t been able to match broader economic metrics.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Nonresidential construction spending increased 0.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.26 trillion, the highest level on record, according to an Associated Builders and Contractors analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data released Tuesday.

Spending rose in nine of the 16 nonresidential subcategories, led by a surge in highway and street construction, which accounted for over 40% of the overall monthly gain, said Anirban Basu, ABC chief economist. Private nonresidential spending increased 0.4% during the month, while public spending jumped 0.2%.

Despite the record-setting total, growth remains uneven across project types, as contractors face high interest rates and trade policy uncertainty, said Basu.

Dive Insight:

Although spending may be at an all-time high, recent hiring practices by contractors suggest they expect fewer opportunities in the near term, said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America. Hiring and job openings both dropped in February, potentially a foreshadowing of a construction slowdown, he said.

“Construction spending rebounded in February, following widespread severe weather that may have slowed projects in January,” said Simonson. “Investment remains positive compared to a year ago but the growth rate for all major categories has cooled, while contractors have trimmed hiring and slashed job openings.”

Simonson also said the record spending number doesn’t necessarily indicate a high water mark.

""I expect substantial additional spending on highway and rail projects, and possibly broadband internet buildout in poorly connected areas,” Simonson said. “There has been rapid growth in water, wastewater, and airport construction, so it is hard to tell if this has peaked yet.”

But despite the new monthly high, the pace of growth tells a different story, said Basu.

For example, public nonresidential construction spending jumped 6.1% compared to last February.

At the forefront of Orchestra BioMed’s efforts is the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, conducted in collaboration with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of AVIM therapy as a treatment for uncontrolled hypertension in pacemaker patients. By modulating intervals to lower blood pressure and enhance diastolic function, AVIM therapy has the potential to redefine the standard of care for such patients. “We believe this therapy can lead to landmark results and lay the foundation for its use in managing blood pressure and cardiovascular health in high-risk populations,” said David Hochman, Chairman, CEO, and Founder of Orchestra BioMed.

Additionally, the company is advancing its Virtue SAB program. A revised study design for the U.S. coronary pivotal study on in-stent restenosis (ISR) has been submitted to the FDA. This study will compare the Virtue SAB, which delivers extended focal-release sirolimus without a balloon coating, to Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon for ISR treatment. FDA approval of the amended investigational device exemption (IDE) is expected in the second quarter of 2025, with study initiation targeted for the second half of the year.

Addressing Strategic Partnerships

Orchestra BioMed is currently restructuring its partnership with Terumo. To expedite this process, both parties have agreed to enter formal mediation, with a resolution anticipated by the second quarter of 2025. The outcome of these discussions is expected to align with the anticipated launch of the Virtue ISR-US pivotal study later this year.

Leadership Enhancements

The company has reinforced its leadership with new appointments to its board of directors. Christopher Cleary, former Senior Vice President at Medtronic, John Mack, former President of Cardiac Surgery at Medtronic, and David Pacitti, CEO of Avanos Medical, bring deep expertise in the medical device and cardiovascular sectors. Additionally, Mark Pomeranz has joined as Executive Vice President & General Manager, Interventional Therapies. Pomeranz has over two decades of experience in medical device innovation, further bolstering Orchestra BioMed’s senior management team.

Key Financial Highlights

Revenue for 2024 was $2.6 million, a slight decline from $2.8 million in 2023, attributed to reduced recognition of partnership revenues.

R&D Expenses increased to $42.8 million from $33.8 million in 2023, reflecting higher costs tied to the BACKBEAT pivotal study.

Net Loss for the year was $61.0 million, or $1.66 per share, compared to $49.1 million, or $1.48 per share, in 2023. The net loss included $10.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $66.8 million as of December 31, 2024, supported by $15.0 million raised through stock sales and $15.0 million drawn from a credit facility.

Looking Ahead

Orchestra BioMed remains committed to advancing its core programs. Upcoming milestones include securing FDA approval for the IDE for the Virtue SAB pivotal study in the second quarter of 2025 and completing site activations for the BACKBEAT study. The company continues to focus on clinical innovation, operational efficiency, and strategic partnerships to address significant unmet needs in cardiovascular care.

By combining breakthrough technologies with skilled leadership, Orchestra BioMed is well-positioned to drive meaningful advances in cardiovascular therapy. Its commitment to transforming care for patients with hypertension and ISR underscores its role as a leader in medical innovation.",https://i0.wp.com/www.mychesco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Orchestra-BioMed.jpg?fit=736%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-02 10:06:10.327095

The high-impact session provided deep insights into the bank’s financial standing and strategic direction, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable growth and stakeholder engagement.

Participants had the opportunity to interact directly with the bank’s board members and executives, gaining a clearer understanding of OmniBSIC Bank’s performance and long-term vision.

Speaking at the event, Managing Director Daniel Asiedu emphasised that the bank’s impressive growth trajectory is the result of deliberate strategy, disciplined execution, and a commitment to sound banking principles.

“This level of performance is not coincidental. It is the outcome of meticulous planning, strategic decision-making, and a relentless focus on delivering value to our customers and shareholders,” he stated.

He highlighted key milestones, including the successful recapitalisation in 2021, the bank’s first profit in 2023, and its impressive financial performance in 2024 with a profit of GHC314 million, doubling the bank’s profit for 2023. The bank’s 2024 results also indicated robust growth in total assets to GHC9.4 billion, driven by a 70% increase in customer deposits to GHC8.2 billion, to end the year very liquid and well capitalised. During the same period, the bank expanded its loan portfolio to GHC1.03 billion from GHC580 million in 2023, a growth of 77%, to support business and economic growth.

Asiedu underscored the bank’s cautious lending approach, balancing sustainable expansion with strong client relationships.

OmniBSIC, Ghana’s fastest-growing bank, remains dedicated to enhancing shareholder value, investing in staff development, and fostering diversity within its workforce. “Our responsibility to shareholders is clear—we are building a bank that is financially strong, operationally efficient, and strategically positioned for long-term growth,” Asiedu affirmed.

Board Chair, Teresa Effie Cooke echoed these sentiments, emphasising the bank’s commitment to exceeding customer and stakeholder expectations. A notable achievement in diversity is the bank’s near 50/50 gender balance, underscoring its dedication to equal opportunity and inclusive leadership. “Diversity strengthens our institution, and we remain committed to fostering an equitable workplace where all employees can thrive,” Cooke stated.

Looking ahead, OmniBSIC Bank is focused on solidifying its position as a key player in Ghana’s financial sector. Its growth strategy includes strengthening its capital base, expanding market share, enhancing product and service offerings, as well as investing in cutting-edge digital solutions, amongst others. “Our trajectory is clear, and our focus remains on sustainable growth, innovation, and delivering superior banking experiences,” Asiedu noted.

By continuously improving operational efficiency and embracing financial technology, OmniBSIC Bank is positioning itself to compete at a higher level, ensuring that customers and stakeholders receive exceptional value in the evolving banking landscape in Ghana.

Headquartered in Accra’s Airport City, OmniBSIC Bank serves its customers through a network of 40 branches across Ghana. The bank also offers a comprehensive suite of products, services, and digital solutions tailored to corporate, SME, and individual needs while actively supporting the communities within which it operates.

To deliver exceptional banking experiences daily, OmniBSIC Bank prioritises investment in technology and employee development. This commitment is reflected in its rigorous staff selection process and comprehensive capacity-building programmes.

OmniBSIC Bank has undergone a comprehensive transformation, showing improvements across all parameters—including financial performance—while achieving numerous successes and receiving multiple recognitions, including the Most Customer-Centric Bank (CIMG, 2022), The Fastest-Growing Corporate Bank in Ghana (Global Banking and Finance Awards, 2023), The Best Bank in Ghana (Ghana Business Awards, 2023), Bank of the year (Ghana Business Standard Awards, 2024), SME Bank of the Year (Ghana Credit Excellence Awards, 2024), Best Ghanaian Owned Emerging Band (Made-In – Ghana Awards, 2024) as well as Best Corporate Bank, Ghana ( Global Banking and Finance Awards, 2024).

Finding a Solution Won’t Be Easy For sportswear brands, moving production out of Vietnam is not a simple solution.

Now, things could get even worse. The United States government is planning to impose new tariffs on products imported from Vietnam. Since Nike produces a huge portion of its shoes and clothes in Vietnam, these new tariffs could mean higher costs for the company.

Nike makes half of its shoes and more than a quarter of its clothes in Vietnam. If the U.S. adds tariffs to these products, Nike will have to decide between raising its prices or absorbing the extra costs. But Nike is already lowering prices on some items to clear out its old inventory. If prices go up too much, fewer people might buy their products, especially since other brands are competing hard for customers.

“If tariffs are extended there, then Nike’s got a problem,” said David Swartz, an analyst.

3 Asian Giants Japan, China and South Korea Unite Against US Tariffs, Pursue Bold Free Trade Pact

Nike isn’t the only company that would be affected. Adidas, another major sportswear company, also relies heavily on Vietnam for production. While Adidas doesn’t make as much in Vietnam as Nike does, it still gets 39% of its shoes and 18% of its clothing from the country. Other brands like Lululemon, Columbia Sportswear, and Amer Sports also depend on Vietnam as a key manufacturing hub.

Why Vietnam Matters to Sportswear Brands

Over the years, Vietnam has become one of the most important places for making sportswear. Many brands have moved their production there to avoid high costs in China. Vietnam is known for producing high-tech running shoes, sportswear, and outdoor gear at competitive prices. But now, with the U.S. government considering tariffs, this advantage could disappear.

Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on footwear from Vietnam is 13.6%, while apparel has an 18.8% tariff, according to Sheng Lu, a professor at the University of Delaware. If these rates go even higher, companies will have to pay much more to bring their products into the U.S. This will affect not just big names like Nike and Adidas but also smaller brands that rely heavily on Vietnam for their products.

Ecuador’s Shocking 27% Tariff Triggers Explosive Trade Clash with Mexico

One of these smaller brands is On, a fast-growing running shoe company. In 2024, On sourced 90% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel from Vietnam. Samuel Wenger, the company’s chief operating officer, acknowledged that tariffs play a role in pricing decisions. “Our premium brand gives us the ability to adapt our pricing thoughtfully,” he said.

Sneaker prices in the U.S. have already gone up by 25% since 2019 due to rising production costs, according to Beth Goldstein, a footwear industry analyst. More price increases could be difficult for shoppers to accept, especially as consumer confidence in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest level in four years.

Finding a Solution Won’t Be Easy

For sportswear brands, moving production out of Vietnam is not a simple solution. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, also make sportswear, but they might face tariffs too. Plus, production costs in these countries are already rising as more brands look to shift away from Vietnam and China.

Trump’s Tariff War Stalls Chinese Investment in Mexico

Factories in Cambodia, for example, are charging 5% to 10% more than before as they receive more orders from companies looking to diversify their supply chains, said Michael Yee, CEO of apparel sourcing company MGF Sourcing. This means that even if Nike or Adidas moves production elsewhere, they might still face higher costs.

Despite the concerns, some experts believe that Vietnam might not get hit with tariffs as hard as China. The Vietnamese government has taken steps to strengthen its relationship with the U.S., such as agreeing to import more American goods and lowering duties. Johannes Loefstrand, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, noted that Vietnam has been skillful in managing its geopolitical ties with the U.S.

Meanwhile, Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary in the Trump administration, pointed out that the president had generally good ties with Vietnam and had no reason to impose tariffs that would be strongly felt by everyday consumers. “People notice the cost of apparel because they buy it fairly frequently,” Ross said.",https://regtechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Regtech-Times-2025-04-02T142413.173.png,N,,2025-04-02 08:03:32.695383

As the April 2 tariff date approaches, brands like Nike and Adidas will need to make tough decisions—fast.
For those tracking the fallout, investors can compare Nike, Adidas, Puma, and On stocks side by side using the TipRanks Stocks Comparison tool.","Trump’s looming tariffs on Vietnam could deliver a brutal hit to U.S. sportswear brands—especially Nike (NKE). The company currently manufactures half of its footwear and nearly a third of its apparel in Vietnam, according to Reuters. If these imports get taxed under the new trade measures launching on April 2, Nike could be forced to either eat the added costs or raise prices—neither of which is great news for a brand already battling falling sales.

Vietnam Dependency Puts Nike and Adidas in the Firing Line

Nike isn’t alone. Adidas (ADDYY), which produces 39% of its footwear and 18% of its apparel in Vietnam, also faces a painful squeeze if the tariffs go through. Moreover, the White House is considering broadening its trade retaliation beyond China, and Vietnam—America’s fifth-largest goods supplier—is next in line. That leaves major apparel and footwear brands scrambling to assess impact.

Smaller Brands Like On and Puma Also Get Hit

It’s not just the giants. Puma (PMMAF) and On (ONON) are both heavily exposed to Vietnam and could be hit just as hard—if not harder. Puma’s shares have already slumped 23% this year following weak profit guidance, and the added pressure from tariffs could deepen the blow. For On, a newer player with fast-growing momentum, added costs could threaten its margins before it ever gets a chance to scale properly.

Vietnam Tries to Lessen the Blow

Vietnam, for its part, is trying to patch things up. The country has cut tariffs on certain U.S. products and approved SpaceX’s Starlink service to smooth over trade relations. But exports to the U.S. make up 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, making it especially vulnerable.

The retail sector is already sounding alarms. H&M’s CEO warned that U.S. consumers could end up footing the bill. As the April 2 tariff date approaches, brands like Nike and Adidas will need to make tough decisions—fast.

Ferrexpo, an iron ore company with assets in Ukraine, that is listed on the London Stock Exchange, produced 489.72 thousand tonnes of DR-pellets in 2024, while no such products were produced in 2023. This is stated in the company’s report.

Total pellets output in 2024 increased by 58% y/y to 6.07 million tons.

In Q4 2024, Ferrexpo increased pellets production by 18% q/q to 1.503 million tonnes, incl. 163.55 thousand tons of DR-pellets.

“In the challenging circumstances, it is pleasing to report a strong increase in production for 2024 – our best annual production performance since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The higher production reflects our ability to access Ukrainian Black Sea ports again and resume exports to customers in MENA and Asia.” – comments Lucio Genovese, Interim Executive Chair of Ferrexpo.

In total, 37 ocean going vessels were loaded in 2024, comprising 32 vessels from Ukraine and five from other ports, compared to just 19 (from Romania) in 2023.

According to Genovese, one of the key achievements of 2024 was setting a new annual record for DR-pellet production.

“These higher quality pellets generate a higher revenue for the business, which is particularly relevant as we continue to experience high input costs. In the fourth quarter, it is also interesting to note that we increased our production of high grade pellets and concentrate, which contributed to lowering our fixed cost base as production levels increased. This is a further example of flexibility, adjusting our production and sales strategies to match evolving market dynamics.” – added Ferrexpo`s Interim Executive Chair.

Meanwhile, low iron ore prices and high raw material costs continue to put pressure on Ferrexpo. Due to ongoing attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, the company is forced to import electricity from the EU at higher tariffs.

As GMK Center reported, at the end of 2023, Ferrexpo reduced the output of pellets by 36% compared to 2022 – to 3.845 million tons. Total output of iron ore products amounted to 4.15 million tons.",https://gmk.center/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/shutterstock_1333837337-e1709154068232.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 11:09:51.129711

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global Greece Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 55.0 in March from 52.6 in February, signaling a significant improvement in operating conditions for Greek manufacturers.

A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 signals contraction.

The March data highlighted a notable uptick in demand, with new orders and export sales rising at the fastest pace in nearly a year, supported by stronger domestic and foreign demand.

That prompted manufacturers to increase their workforce at the sharpest rate since January 2022.

“Growth in the Greek manufacturing sector accelerated at the end of the first quarter, as the pace of expansion reached the strongest for almost a year,” said Sian Jones, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence:

“Improvements in demand conditions supported greater output, new orders, input buying and employment.”

However, inflationary pressures intensified, with input costs rising at the quickest rate since November 2022.

This led to a corresponding increase in selling prices as manufacturers passed on higher costs to customers.

Despite these challenges, manufacturers expressed optimism about future output growth, buoyed by expectations of continued demand strength and increased construction activity.
