I think what we're looking at, back to the consumer point, is a consumer who's being mindful and choiceful.
Yeah, I do actually want to hit on that, because the housing market is something that I've been discussing with executives.
He said that a sub 6% mortgage rate may be a catalyst to get the housing market inflection really started here.
And then we can bring on some ancillary, um, um, um, products.","I do want to kick off with the retail sales number. We did see some softness within electronics sales last month. They were up about 0.3%. Describe to us exactly what you're seeing with the state, the demand of the consumer heading into the holiday, and are they pulling back a bit?

Well, we actually had a chance to release our earnings at the end of August, which is perfect timing. And we had said at that point, we were already running in low single digit positive comps. We were seeing strength in computing and gaming and headphones and wearables and mobile. So we actually were continuing to see that strength, especially through back to school. And then we forecasted that for the quarter. We'd probably end up similar to our last quarter in terms of comp growth. So it's a consumer who actually in our mind has stayed pretty steady in terms of demand.

For months now, we've been discussing the FOMC meeting out tomorrow. Markets are pricing in a quarter point cut. What are the headwinds up against consumers right now? And how do you expect perhaps a cut to impact the consumer behavior?

I mean, I think what's hard is the consumer is not a monolith, as you know. And we're seeing some different behaviors depending on the consumer. We see almost everyone looking for value. Now, people describe that differently, but very peaky events like back to school or our Black Friday in July event. And at the same time, when there's innovation, something new like the Switch 2, or like some of the new rev of computing that we're seeing. People are willing to spend on those higher price points for those items that they know they're going to have for multiple years. And so we actually are seeing a consumer, while bifurcated a bit, still willing to spend if they really feel like it's a great value.

And in your last quarter, you did say that third quarter same-store sales are expected to be in line with Q2. But, like you just said, we have this Nintendo. We also got those latest announcements from Apple around the iPhone, the Watch, AirPods. Do you think that it just won't be enough to really see a surge in growth here?

I think what we're looking at, back to the consumer point, is a consumer who's being mindful and choiceful. All of those innovations, especially for our model, that is what feeds our model. We consumerize new technology better than anyone. And so we're super excited about those things, and at the same time, very low housing turnover. So a challenge in some of the major appliances or TVs areas. So we're kind of trying to find that balance between super excitement about what's coming, and at the same time a consumer who's just being a little bit more choiceful.

Yeah, I do actually want to hit on that, because the housing market is something that I've been discussing with executives. I did speak to Low's CEO. And what he said was something really interesting. He said that a sub 6% mortgage rate may be a catalyst to get the housing market inflection really started here. You did see declines in appliances and home theater. But do you do you see a turning point to really get consumers back into those big ticket items? Does the housing market need to change here?

I think the housing market definitely helps. It's not the only thing. Innovation, large, large screen TVs, those are also things that make people just excited to want to, especially have entertainment at home when maybe they don't want to spend the money to go out. And so there's a real value prop there. However, having more turnover in the housing market definitely helps because you're more likely to outfit that uh entertainment room or your kitchen or any of those spaces. And I agree with Marvin, I think that if you could just get below kind of this catalyst number, you might start to see that turnover because I think people are really looking for just an affordable new home to buy.

Yeah, and when you think about appliances and home theater, these are pricier goods. Are the everyday consumer going for it? Do you see only high-income shoppers really willing to spend that sort of splurge?

I think what's great and unique to our model, all we do is consumer electronics. And all we think about is how can we provide the biggest, widest assortment at all the price points. So we have everything from a very opening price point. You can get a humongous 100-inch TV for sub $1,000. Um, or you can work your way all the way up to the most premium TV that you could want. And our goal is just whatever your budget is. Doesn't matter where you are on the income strata, wherever your budget is, we have something for you.

We did hear from Moody's this morning that the high-income consumer is really driving spending here in the US. Do you see that at your stores?

Uh, interestingly, we have actually seen all of our consumer cohorts continue to spend. Now, again, they're thoughtful about what. They might go for more of an entry point TV versus a really high-end one. But we have actually, when we've even seen some growth in the lower income consumer.

Oh, interesting. Well, and what are they going for? Are they going for those promotional deals?

I think there's a few things. Our model is really built on replacement and replenishment. Your technology does, it dies on you at some point. And, you know, we're four, five years out from the pandemic. There was a huge pull forward and install base, and whoever you are, you might need something new in order to do your job. Your phone might have broke, you need a new computer, those headphones you really need in order to do your job. And so that's when we want to be there. And it might not be you need the most expensive computer, you just need a good opening price point laptop and we have a huge assortment of those.

Yeah, AI has been driving the market rally. Has it been driving replacements as well? Yet?

I I I think it is part, it's part and parcel with replace. So our model works when you've got replacement cycles kicking in and some level of innovation. That is our sweet spot. And in this case, AI being just enough, I mean, it can be something as simple as the AI chips take your battery life from two hours to 24 hours. That can be a compelling feature for those of us who travel all the time. And so all we're trying to do is make sure we've trained 30,000 associates to help customers understand what really can they do that's different with AI, and a lot of customers just want to future proof themselves and make sure they have the right capacity for wherever AI takes them.

And these are things we've been hearing throughout all your quarterly results. Another thing that we've been talking about so much over the past 24 hours is President Trump's giving the idea that maybe companies would pull back and only report twice. We did ask Octa CEO just before about this. He said it's great to talk to investors, but there is this industry obsession about quarterly earnings. What's your take on maybe repor reporting, rather, only twice a year?

I mean, I think our focus has always been how can we get investors the most pertinent information at the right times to make the best decisions. Sometimes, I think when you're in a really volatile backdrop, you do want to be laying some of that groundwork quarterly. For me, that's less about the forecast and more just about providing color, just like what we're talking about about the business. That being said, I think we're all trying to find ways to free up capacity and make sure we're spending capacity in the most value-added areas.

Yeah. Now, one thing that does have investors excited next quarter is that marketplace launch. And so describe to me, how exactly does the Best Buy marketplace differentiate from what we see at some of your top competitors like Walmart and Amazon, and even maybe Target there as well?

Well, I think we are different. We're all we do is specialty retail and specialty consumer electronics. And we're approaching this, and the reason we started is we could see customers searching for things we didn't have. You might need that iPhone 12 case. We're on 17 now. I I can't carry all of those things in the store. I can't carry every color of blender. This gives us a chance to have this deeper assortment, sharper price points. We can bring on innovative, new, exciting technology vendors that may not otherwise be able to handle our scale. And then we can bring on some ancillary, um, um, um, products. And those are the kind where we can see people like curious about, do you carry a pool robot? Well, maybe not in store, but now we have this this broader assortment. And so I think we are also trying to do it in a way where you can bring back your product to the store, we'll help facilitate that return. We have universal return windows. We're trying to think about how to do this in a way that really aligns with our brand, and yet kind of opens the aperture on what's possible.

And one thing that you're opening the door to is I saw on your website, you have these release dates around Pokémon cards and all the collectibles. I mean, what sort of response have you gotten to these trading cards?

It's incredible. And this is where I think us really understanding our customers. Not just what's the technology they buy, but what are they interested in? And more importantly, what are they passionate about? And this is a space where people are passionate. Very passionate about it.

And so we want to, like, we want to bring that energy. We want to bring the energy to the stores. We want to be there for our customers. Um, and trust me, there are lines and people are passionate. And so we just want to we want to keep exploring this space because our biggest objective is to bring that fun and sparkle to what it is that we do.

And last question here, as you head into the holiday, what have you seen so far in terms of just the response? What are consumers really looking for right now in terms of products?

Yeah, we've seen growth really broad-based across a lot of different categories. And there's a bunch we're excited about. Handheld gaming is big and that's Switch 2, but it's also a lot of development from other manufacturers who are really entering that space. Computing continues to be strong. You have Windows 10 sunsetting, moving up into Windows 11, so there'll be a a big driver there. We continue to see strength in our mobile business where people are looking for at least the replacement of that phone, um, and some new form features there. Strength in headphones, strength in wearables, like there are a lot of different facets where we're seeing demand. And we are super excited to bring those to life for a holiday.

Corrie, I may have to splurge on those new AirPods. I love them.

They're lovely. They'll track your heart rate.

I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance.
Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for CVS Health (of which 1 is a bit concerning!)","For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) shareholders, since the share price is down 28% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 75%.

On a more encouraging note the company has added US$4.1b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the three-year loss for shareholders.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

During the three years that the share price fell, CVS Health's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 17% each year. In comparison the 10% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..

What About Dividends?

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for CVS Health the TSR over the last 3 years was -19%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

It's nice to see that CVS Health shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 8%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for CVS Health (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.

Long-Term Financial Outlook

The Company is reiterating its Fiscal 2026 guidance that was recently provided on its earnings call on August 7th, 2025 and introducing its three-year financial outlook.

Over the next three years, from a base of Fiscal 2025 through Fiscal 2028, the Company expects revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate of mid-single digits in constant currency. Operating margin is expected to expand approximately 100 to 150 basis points by Fiscal 2028 in constant currency, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage balanced with continued investments in the Company’s long-term strategic priorities.

In addition, capital expenditures are expected to represent approximately 4% to 5% of revenue annually through Fiscal 2028.

The Company expects to continue returning excess free cash flow to shareholders over the next three years, with plans to return at least $2 billion on a cumulative basis through Fiscal 2028 through its regular quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases, subject to the authorization of its Board of Directors and overall business and market conditions.

The Company’s Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock by approximately 10% to $0.9125 per share at the beginning of Fiscal 2026, representing an annual dividend of $3.65 per share.

The Company’s current share repurchase authorization enables it to repurchase up to $1.6 billion in shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to overall business and market conditions.

The Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, tariffs and other consumer spending-related headwinds, global supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility, among other factors. The Fiscal 2026 and long-range outlook exclude any potential restructuring-related and other net charges that may be incurred in future periods, as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.

NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Because Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global company, the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on the Company’s reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), the Company’s discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. The Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to its reported operating results. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Management believes this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in the Company’s businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

This press release also includes certain other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures relating to the impact of charges and other items as described herein. The Company uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and to better represent the manner in which it conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods. While the Company considers non-U.S. GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures reported by other companies.

Please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC for more information about the Company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP.

Additionally, the Company’s long-term financial outlook excludes certain anticipated restructuring-related and other charges. The Company is not able to provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because certain material items that impact these measures, such as the timing and exact amount of charges related to its restructuring plans, have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP based financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250915511547/en/304083/22/RL_Corporation_%28Black%29.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:12:42.496355

It’s a challenge—and opportunity—Donna Morris, chief people officer at Walmart, is navigating at scale, as she leads people operations for a workforce of 2.1 million associates worldwide.

Morris, announced last week as our HR Executive of the Year, says HR needs to play a pivotal role in designing and executing an AI integration strategy—and keep focused in a landscape where pressure to unleash AI quickly is pervasive. Morris draws insights from her own AI integration accomplishments—for instance, designing and rolling out an AI-powered mobile and desktop solution for store associates that has since scaled across the business, as well as a gen AI-driven assistant functioning as a “playground” to encourage associate experimentation with AI.

3 lessons from Walmart’s AI integration

Morris and her team continue to explore ways to drive efficiencies with AI, including in HR. Her AI integration experiences have highlighted a number of realities that Morris says HR should keep top of mind as they traverse their own AI journeys:

1. Know your destination.

As Walmart’s HR teams began exploring how AI would impact the workforce, it was critical to “position” the work around the broader leadership goal of creating a future Walmart that is “people-led, tech-powered,” she says. That “deliberate” choice to prioritize people has helped inform AI integration decisions.

Having those intentional conversations before any AI integration project is necessary.

“I would encourage my peers to engage with their leadership teams in terms of what role they want technology to play as part of their business as they go forward,” she says. “If you don’t know what you’re building toward, you’re never going to get there.”

That foundation will be important as HR faces pressure from all sides to drive value from AI. The C-suite, boards of directors and other stakeholders all have a “heightened desire” to “move fast,” she says. But HR needs to position AI integration as a true journey.

“If you don’t know your destination, you’re never going to get there.”

2. Step into the leadership role.

Apart from setting the pace, HR can use its seat at the table to keep the focus on the workforce impact during any AI integration project.

Ask questions like:

What are our internal capabilities?

Who are our external partners?

How are we thinking about data?

Where does AI make sense—and where does it not?

Be a core part of “framing the strategy and the role people will play,” she advises. That work should involve close, cross-organizational partnerships, particularly with tech functions.

“HR has to work really, really closely with digital,” she says. “There are certainly some companies deciding those two should merge; I’m not an advocate saying that needs to be the reality, but rather there needs to be a tight partnership—where you’re looking at, what role will people play, what role will technology play and what is the business really trying to accomplish?”

3. Avoid ‘AI for AI’s sake’.

Without such strategic forethought, organizations can end up with a tech landscape that Morris likens to the famed Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, Calif.—a sprawling mansion once home to a maze of 500 rooms, with doors and windows that led nowhere.

“If you don’t have a deliberate plan to how you’re going to leverage AI, your outcome won’t be as successful,” she says. “You’ll lose time and, frankly, credibility.”

Pursuing “AI for AI’s sake” is not an inexpensive venture either, she adds. Price tags are tied to every decision made along an AI integration journey—so, each step needs to be purposeful.

“We have to be really strategic about where we’re investing,” Morris says, “and how we’re investing.”",https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Walmart.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 08:06:31.749172

AmTrust introduced new product lines in property, environmental, and builders risk as part of its E&S expansion. The New York-based holding company also consolidated its primary, excess, and environmental products into a new brokerage casualty group.

“AmTrust’s E&S division is at a true inflection point as we continue to carry out our long-term strategy to make meaningful investments in hiring top-tier talent and broadening our offerings to better serve our insureds and position us for sustained growth in the E&S market,” said Erich Bublitz, head of AmTrust E&S, in a statement.

Health's stock has underperformed, declining by approximately 12% year-to-date as of September 2025. This divergence from the broader market raises critical questions about the company's strategic positioning and operational resilience. However, a closer examination of its recent initiatives, macroeconomic tailwinds, and competitive dynamics reveals a compelling case for near-term recovery.

Strategic Positioning: Reinforcing Healthcare Access and Innovation

CVS Health has positioned itself at the forefront of the U.S. healthcare transformation by expanding access to preventive care and leveraging digital innovation. A key example is its rollout of the 2025–2026 flu vaccination program, which includes a 3-in-1 diagnostic test for influenza A, influenza B, and COVID-19 at 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia Updated flu vaccinations now available at CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic®[ 3 ]. This initiative aligns with consumer behavior trends: a survey indicates that 63% of Americans plan to get a flu shot this season, with 28% favoring retail pharmacies like CVS Updated flu vaccinations now available at CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic®[ 3 ]. By integrating diagnostic testing with vaccination services, CVS is not only addressing public health needs but also enhancing its role as a one-stop healthcare destination.

The company's strategic focus on proactive health management is further underscored by its digital health platforms, which aim to streamline patient engagement and chronic disease management. These efforts are critical in an industry where convenience and accessibility increasingly drive consumer choice.

Competitive Dynamics: Navigating a Fragmented Landscape

CVS faces intense competition from rivals such as Walgreens and Rite Aid, as well as emerging telehealth providers. However, its dual presence in retail pharmacy and clinical services (via MinuteClinic) creates a unique value proposition. The 3-in-1 test, for instance, differentiates CVS by offering rapid, integrated diagnostics—a feature that could attract both retail and clinical customers.

Macroeconomic factors also play a pivotal role. Global trends such as uneven economic growth and fiscal strains on governments are reshaping healthcare systems, with a growing emphasis on cost containment and preventive care Macroeconomics Overview - World Bank Group[ 1 ]. CVS's focus on affordable, accessible services aligns with these shifts, positioning it to capture market share in a sector increasingly prioritizing efficiency.

Operational Resilience and Near-Term Catalysts

CVS's operational resilience is evident in its ability to adapt to evolving consumer demands. The company's recent cost-cutting measures, while not detailed in public reports, are likely part of a broader strategy to maintain profitability amid margin pressures. Additionally, its expansion into underserved regions—driven by structural reforms in healthcare systems globally—could unlock new revenue streams Kenya Economic Update (KEU) - World Bank Group[ 2 ].

Near-term catalysts for recovery include the flu season, which historically drives foot traffic and ancillary sales. The 2025–2026 vaccination rollout, combined with the 3-in-1 test, could generate significant incremental revenue. Furthermore, CVS's alignment with global efforts to strengthen public health infrastructure—such as those seen in Kenya and Peru—positions it to benefit from long-term policy tailwinds Updated flu vaccinations now available at CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic®[ 3 ].

Conclusion: A Compelling Buy Case

While short-term headwinds have pressured CVS's stock, its strategic initiatives and macroeconomic tailwinds suggest a path to recovery. The company's emphasis on preventive care, digital innovation, and operational efficiency positions it to outperform in a healthcare landscape increasingly defined by accessibility and affordability. For investors, the current valuation offers an attractive entry point into a business with clear near-term catalysts and long-term structural growth potential.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd24f7700bc002.png,N,,2025-09-16 01:03:22.329215

And as it turns out, the retail juggernaut's scale and reach are proving to be tremendous assets in the AI race.

That's because most top AI companies — like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, or Meta — operate in a primarily virtual space, processing unfathomably complex rivers of information into more digital information. AI-adjacent companies like Nvidia, Intel, and Oracle focus on providing the physical infrastructure upon which the AI machines function. Then there are the companies that are using digital intelligence to deliver physical results through automation and augmented experiences, like Tesla and Amazon.

Walmart, by contrast, has a vast and complicated set of physical challenges to solve as the largest retailer in the US — and the world. Those include everything from cleaning up spills in the dairy aisle to stocking shelves.

""We move billions of items around every month, every year,"" Walmart US CEO John Furner said Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference. He said the company has been developing machine learning tools and other automation projects since around 2015.

Furner said that the company's AI models and supply chain automation help plan inventory to arrive at the right aisle at the right time, for example. One technique involves creating ""digital twins"" of each facility to model the movement of merchandise through the system on its way to customers.

Furner also said store associates increasingly have an AI chatbot handy via their handheld devices to help them better set priorities and help customers.

""It's a combination of people being powered by technology. There's a lot of judgment to retail and decision-making. And we're in a very dynamic industry,"" he said. ""We think this next phase of physical AI in combination with Gen AI is going to be really helpful.""

The company's head of e-commerce, David Guggina, told the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech conference last week how AI is helping his team run experiments and fulfill orders at an increasingly rapid rate.

Guggina said his team is now able to work at breathtaking speed behind the scenes, too.

""What took a data scientist days or weeks before can now be done in minutes,"" he said.

AI also helps ensure that each of the company's 4,700 stores has the kinds of products best suited to their local markets, slashing delivery times to minutes after a customer places an order.

""We've just completed the third inning,"" he said by way of the classic baseball game analogy. ""So we're still early with regard to our automation journey in the fulfillment network.""

These digital-to-physical uses of AI are also complemented by a myriad of ""micro agents"" that handle tasks like tracking local event calendars or monitoring inventory levels.

Walmart, of course, is still fine-tuning its AI approach, and there have been hiccups.

The proliferation of bespoke Walmart-made AI agents eventually started to confuse users, the company told the Wall Street Journal.

The company has rolled many of those micro agents into four ""super agents"" designed to assist shoppers, merchandisers, programmers, and third-party marketplace sellers.

Happy Labor Day Weekend! For me, this holiday brings a much-anticipated trip to the lake with loved ones—and I hope it brings rest and relaxation for you, too.

But before we clock out to enjoy the last few days of summer, let's reflect on the reason for the season. Labor Day recognizes workers' contributions to America's ""strength, prosperity and well-being,"" according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

In order to be strong, prosperous and well, we need health care workers—as reflected in the most recent data from the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA). The health care industry employed 17 million people in 2023, topping the charts as the largest employment sector in the U.S.

Still, it's no secret that the health care workforce is struggling. NCHWA predicts that by 2037, the country will be short 187,130 full-time equivalent physicians. In rural areas, the gap between supply and demand will be worse.

The greatest puzzle of the health care workforce shortage is that we can't just hire our way out of it. The U.S. population is rapidly aging and will require more services in the coming years than we're currently equipped to provide.

While there's no way to prevent the incoming crisis, there are some things that health systems can do to cushion the blow. And they're doing them. In the past several months, I've covered health care high schools that aim to start training the next generation early; a new medical school that is waiving tuition; virtual care initiatives that can extend the reach of a single physician across state lines; and AI tools that are working alongside (and in some cases, independent of) clinicians to lighten their load.

There is a lot to be hopeful about. But when I spoke to physicians about this topic in the spring, they pointed to a place where we could still do better.

Dr. Harry Severance, a member of the board of directors at Duke University School of Medicine's Collaborative Cardiovascular Society and Research Network and a member of the Tennessee Medical Association's wellbeing committee, told me that physicians will not remain in jobs where they do not feel respected. For many, the corporatization of the health care system has reduced their sense of agency. The current payer model has put checks and balances on hard-earned medical knowledge that many doctors find excessive. The administrative burden has contributed to record-high levels of burnout.

""You can recruit people in, but after a while—especially younger, more flexible people—they're going to turn around and leave,"" Severance told me. ""Why should they put up with all this abuse when they've got alternatives?""

I'll leave you with a quote from Dr. Laura Jett, a retired family medicine physician, who shared her reflections on the profession with me earlier this year.

""I've had time to think about what it means to be a doctor,"" Jett said. ""What is the service? What do we do with our lives? Nothing but work.

""It's a tremendous offering,"" she continued. ""It's devalued a lot. The mechanization or the industrialization of the medical practices, the delivery of health care, diminishes that sense of feeling like you're valued. ""

Major health care headlines from the week

Eighty-three percent of physician informatics officers have reported expanded responsibilities over the past two years, according to a new survey from WittKieffer—the largest of its kind. I spoke with the report's authors, CMIOs and CNIOs to understand how the role is shifting and what that means for health systems. Click here for the scoop.

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce plans to host a hearing on AI use and integration in the nation's health systems, examining how the new technology is improving care delivery for patients and providers. The event will take place on Wednesday, September 3 at 10:15 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the committee's website.

The American Medical Association (AMA) is pushing back against CMS' proposed Medicare physician payment rule for 2026, calling it ""flawed"" and ""faulty."" Specifically, the AMA raised concerns about CMS' proposed 2.5 percent cut to work relative-value units (RVUs) and physician intraservice time for most services, which would affect more than 95 percent of the services doctors provide,according to an analysis by the professional organization.The AMA also said that CMS' proposed reduction in practice-expense RVUs could drop overall physician payment by seven percent at certain facilities,including hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.CMS is accepting comments on the proposed rule now through September 12.

Pulse Check

Executive perspectives on key industry issues

Merriam-Webster doesn't release their ""word of the year"" until December, but if I had to bet on one, it would be ""tariff.""

President Donald Trump and his administration have been clear about their goal to shift manufacturing to the United States from overseas, placing tariffs on other countries' exports and sparking negotiations with a handful.

It has been less clear, however, how these plans could impact the health care industry.

That's why I spoke with Jeff DiLullo, CEO of Philips North America, for this week's Pulse Check feature. Philips announced a $150 million investment in U.S. manufacturing, research and development this month: including the expansion of its Reedsville, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facility, which produces AI-enabled ultrasounds systems.

I asked DiLullo about the timing of this announcement, exploring how Trump's ""America First"" policies could impact U.S. health care systems. Below, find a portion of our conversation:

Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

What is it about this moment that inspired the $150 million commitment to U.S. manufacturing, research and development? Why now?

I'll take you on a very quick journey. Number one, [during] the first Trump administration, we saw localization was needing to be more of a thing, right? It was just very clear. So we started things in motion way back then, eight or so years ago.

Now, if you can think back that far, the pandemic had a pretty sizable impact across the industry, our supply chain. You saw health care systems really struggling to get supplies, and so all of us sort of had this massive wake up moment that we needed to be much more local in our sourcing. That takes time in an FDA-cleared environment, so we've been working toward these things for years.

I do think the current administration, their focus on investment in the U.S., their desire to get manufacturing back here, makes it very easy to reduce some hurdles, to get back into a larger [U.S.-based] footprint that we want to have.

Why now? The U.S. health care market is growing. The cost of health care is growing at twice the pace of inflation. So that's not good, but this is a growing health care market, the most [rapidly] growing market in the world in terms of health care delivery as a percentage of per capita [spending]. So we absolutely want to be growing here. And we want to invest and make sure we have more agile, shorter supply chains, easier response to customers and the health systems we serve. That's why we're doubling down here.

You mentioned that the current administration has reduced some of those hurdles to expansion in the United States. What are those hurdles, specifically?

First of all, I want to applaud the administration and recognize what they're doing to try and reshape balance of trade. I think that has been a major point of the administration from day one, and we support that effort to do it. Practically speaking, this medtech business is largely a U.S. industry. About 70 percent of manufacturing, broadly speaking, across our industry, is done here in the U.S. About 90-plus percent of the research and development is in the U.S.

We're not quite that way [at Philips]. Our roots are in in the Netherlands, but we've continued to grow and invest and expand here in the U.S., as we've seen this as a market. So the industry itself, is very much an American industry, and I think we're already accomplishing many things the administration wants to do. We're doubling down where the growth is. Investment is key, and I think the more you can invest, the more likely it is to be able to grow your business here in what I would consider a reasonably-friendly regulatory environment, very specific on the FDA side of that regulation, I'm just talking in terms of the ability to move quickly.

For example, we wanted to get this facility up and running in six months. Nobody thought we could do it [because of] the bureaucracy at the state level and some of the construction. We sat and talked with our partners, Congressman Dr. John Joyce, Senator Dave McCormick, other local officials that were instrumental in helping us move the paperwork and [have] the ability to get all the approvals we need so that we can construct. We got it done in the time we said—actually under budget, under time—and now we have a new facility in Reedsville that's shipping U.S.-made product to the U.S. and across the globe. That's how we clear barriers. We partner with the folks that want to help us get rid of the non-value added work and helps us speed the production.

One of the concerns I've heard coming out of other industries as they look to move more manufacturing to the United States is that prices could go up as a result of the higher labor costs here. How are you managing costs at Philips and in the med tech industry, while operating largely in the U.S.?

That's partly true, if everything stays the same as what we're doing today. Although, for example, at Philips, we have a huge software and AI part of our business. About 50 percent of the code that's written today for Philips is written by AI. So we're actually deploying capabilities within our own organization to lower our cost structure, to be able to be more competitive.

That doesn't necessarily mean we're taking away American jobs, but we're putting jobs where people need to do the thought work. We're putting jobs where people do the physical manufacturing. And I think from our standpoint, we we're finding a way to absorb the impact of tariffs today. We're also finding very creative ways to automate our own processes and systems so that we're allowing people to focus on things they're best utilized to do. So bringing manufacturing back here is only part of the discussion. It's how else we're taking out cost in development and coding and other things that are allowing us to put resources where we want to grow up.

Our labor rate probably does go up. That's an isolated view of a business. And so we're kind of taking a much more holistic view of the total value. If I'm manufacturing here, and if I can get my product sooner and get it to my customers sooner and get it installed sooner, I'm going to get paid sooner. I actually have an incentive to move faster and deliver this capability to customers faster to allow me to offset some of that potential labor cost.

Why is it so important to have these capabilities in the United States as opposed to overseas?

There are always some things that impact the ability to deliver care. Cost is continuing to go up. The fact that I can actually start to build and deploy systems in days much closer to where my customers consume the technology—that is lifesaving in just about every case. I'm actually getting lifesaving capability in the hands of health care providers much sooner and ultimately at a lower cost, as I continue to develop more electronically or digitally capable tools. And the more I can deploy in some of these virtual or digital ways, or AI-enabled workflows, I'm actually allowing people to work wherever they're at. They can interact with radiology studies or diagnostics from their home, from their laptop.

I'm making the whole process much, much faster. I don't have to deal with privacy laws. Everything I do is embedded here in the United States. I don't have to deal with transatlantic privacy. I'm compliant here in the U.S. for all our cybersecurity requirements. It's faster, much more effective, to be able to get it into the market sooner, and completely compliant with laws and regulations that we don't have to satisfy outside of the U.S.

And the side note is, we're the most stringent regulatory environment in the world. So if we can do it right here, we can do it anywhere.

Executive Edge

How health care leaders are managing their own health

This week, I spoke with Suzen Heeley, executive director of design and construction at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She's the head designer on their new Kenneth C. Griffin Pavillion—a high-rise patient care tower that will soon be added to that famous Big Apple skyline.

Heeley described how the design of a space can influence human psychology, proactively contributing to (or detracting from) our sense of safety.

I'm cooking up a feature article on the Pavillion, which you can expect next month—but for now, here's a sneak peek at how Heely and her team are considering nurse wellbeing in their design:

Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

""We're really trying to use research to develop the design as opposed to just making a beautiful space, and thinking about how it can impact not just the patients, but certainly the staff as well. We want to think about them and the pressures and the stress that they're under every day.

""One of the things we heard [from staff], which I thought was fascinating, was that there are periods where they want to be joyful. Somebody's getting engaged or having a baby or whatever, and they feel like they don't have a space where they can express their emotions in that way, because patients are maybe not in a place where they feel joy. We need to create those kind of off-stage spaces for staff to be in to express those emotions, whether they're joy or sorrow. You know, there's a lot of emotion that happens in these spaces on a day-to-day basis. So that was really kind of the foundation of the work that we were doing. We wanted to, of course, build that into our thinking and the way we were creating the design for the space.

""We have things like respite spaces, so places for them to have a private moment when they need it for emotional release, respite, refuge or renewal. And then we think about what those spaces could be, giving the staff the ability to control the temperature, lighting, sound if they want to play their music (or if they want to just sit and feel the quiet, they can do that). But these are spaces where staff can just step away. Unfortunately, on these nursing units, oftentimes they can't walk away too far because they're needed there. So we will have these respite spaces embedded in the patient units to take care of them and be there for them.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2722880/jeff-dilullo.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 15:11:44.911648

What the Latest Metrics Say About Walmart Walmart, which competes with Costco Wholesale Corporation COST and Target Corporation TGT, has been a standout performer, with shares rallying 28.5% in the past year, almost in tandem with the industry’s growth of 28.2%.","The retail landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, and Walmart Inc. WMT is at the forefront, betting big on artificial intelligence. WMT is accelerating its push into artificial intelligence with the rollout of AI super agents that could redefine how the retail industry currently operates. CEO Douglas McMillon emphasized that artificial intelligence plays a vital role in enhancing both customer and employee experiences, with Walmart’s AI efforts built around four super agents designed to handle different aspects of the business.

Leading the charge is Sparky, the smiling digital assistant in Walmart’s app. Sparky is already shifting the experience from search-based navigation to AI-powered assistance and is set to become the primary tool for product discovery, reorders and returns. Early feedback has been positive, and Walmart plans to scale Sparky into a more intelligent and personalized companion for shoppers.

Complementing Sparky are three more super agents. Starting with the associate agent, which will consolidate key functions such as scheduling and sales data into one hub. For suppliers and advertisers, another agent will simplify onboarding, order management and campaign execution, enhancing efficiency across Walmart’s ecosystem.

Colgate-Palmolive Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Colgate-Palmolive, you need to believe in the ongoing resilience of its global brands across consumer health and pet nutrition, especially as the company steps up investment in productivity. The recent dividend announcement combined with a US$200 million to US$300 million productivity initiative does not substantially change the near-term catalyst around margin pressures from raw material costs, nor does it greatly mitigate the key risk of prolonged consumer caution in major markets.

Among all recent announcements, the board’s decision to maintain the quarterly cash dividend at US$0.52 per share stands out as especially relevant, reinforcing confidence in steady shareholder returns despite ongoing economic challenges. This consistency may continue to support investor sentiment as the company pursues its 2030 goals, though actual topline acceleration still hinges on category recovery and relief in raw material input costs.

However, it is important to remember that ongoing volatility in raw material and packaging expenses remains a risk investors should not ignore, especially when...

Colgate-Palmolive's outlook anticipates $22.4 billion in revenue and $3.5 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection is based on 3.8% annual revenue growth and a $0.6 billion increase in earnings from the current $2.9 billion level.

Keeping costs down for consumers is paramount as the grocery industry ramps up e-commerce, Instacart CEO Chris Rogers said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Wednesday.

“Affordability is probably the biggest unlock to online grocery adoption. We know that it’s the No. 1 reason that people churn off of Instacart,” Rogers said, noting that affordability will be a “key lever” in retaining more consumers.

To that end, Instacart is working with its retail partners on their pricing strategies as well as integrating retailers’ loyalty programs and offering weekly flyers, said Rogers, who became CEO in mid-August after nearly six years with the grocery technology company, including three as its chief business officer.

While retailers decide how to price on Instacart, the grocery technology company is urging them to price at or just above in-store prices, Rogers said, noting that retailers that offer price parity outperform those that mark up prices on the Instacart platform.

“We’re going to really show the business case to retailers and show them the compelling reasons why they should do this and also just make sure that we’re educating them on the broader digital landscape,” Rogers said.

During the past 12 months, sales among price-parity retailers have grown, on average, 10 percentage points faster than among marked-up retailers, he noted.

“We’re also seeing on our platform that users that are shopping on price-parity retailers are retaining better, so the data is suggesting that this is a strategic move for our retail partners,” he said.

Earlier this year, Instacart announced that Schnuck Markets, Heritage Grocers Group and home improvement chain Lowe’s switched to price parity. Walmart Canada lowered its markup, as did Costco on its same-day delivery websites for the U.S. and Canada.

Instacart is testing merchandising tools within its app that highlight price-parity retailers, Rogers added.

The company is also focused on continuing the momentum with its enterprise platform. Instacart sees the opportunity to expand its tools for retailers’ sites beyond North America, Rogers said. The company’s acquisition earlier this year of e-commerce solutions provider Wynshop “kind of exposed the fact that there is real product market fit for our enterprise suite of products beyond [North America],” he said.

The final priority Rogers outlined for the company is accelerating its ads and data revenue as well as ramping up monetization of data through its newly launched Consumer Insights Portal.

“I had a retailer recently tell me that the amount that I’m writing them a check for the ads business is larger than the SaaS fee that they’re paying us for the storefront,” Rogers said, referring to the acronym for Software as a Service.

Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Medtronic.

Approach 2: Medtronic Price vs Earnings

For a consistently profitable company like Medtronic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used and meaningful valuation metrics. It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of Medtronic's earnings, providing a snapshot of both value and growth expectations.

Growth prospects and business risks play a significant role in determining what a ""normal"" PE ratio should be. Companies with strong growth and stable earnings often command higher PE multiples because investors anticipate future profits. On the other hand, when risks are elevated or future growth appears limited, the fair PE typically decreases.

Medtronic currently trades at a PE ratio of 25.9x. For context, the average PE ratio among its medical equipment peers is 47.4x, while the broader industry average is 29.1x. This suggests Medtronic is being valued more conservatively than many of its peers.

Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio calculation provides a more nuanced view by considering Medtronic's specific growth rates, risk profile, profit margins, and market cap. This tailored approach avoids the limitations of simple peer comparison and takes into account factors unique to Medtronic rather than relying on broad industry averages. Based on these inputs, Medtronic’s Fair Ratio is 27.5x.

With an actual PE of 25.9x and a Fair Ratio of 27.5x, Medtronic's valuation aligns closely with expectations for a business of its quality, growth, and risk.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Medtronic Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. Put simply, a Narrative is your personal story about Medtronic, combining what you think about its future (like expected revenue, margin, and risks) with how those beliefs translate into a fair value for the stock.

With Narratives, you move beyond just tracking numbers. You actually link the company’s business story, such as why it will succeed or struggle, to concrete financial forecasts and arrive at a price you believe is justified. Narratives are easy to create and update right inside Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share and discuss their perspectives.

This approach is practical too: you can quickly compare your fair value with the market price to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell. Because Narratives update when fresh news or earnings arrive, your view stays relevant and informed. For example, some Medtronic Narratives currently see fair value as high as $112 if innovation and robotics outpace expectations, while others see value closer to $82 amid execution and margin concerns. This shows that what you believe about the business really can shape your investment choices.

The current Ray-Ban Meta glasses don’t display anything on the lenses, meaning wearers rely on audio feedback or Meta’s phone app.
The success of Apple’s AirPods and other wireless earbuds could strengthen the case for smart glasses.","Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a bold claim on the social media giant’s earnings call in July. People without smart glasses may one day be at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” compared to those who do use the tech, he told analysts.

That vision for the company’s future could come into focus this week during the Meta Connect conference, where the tech giant outlines its next steps and announces new products. Reports suggest Meta will announce a new pair of AI-powered smart glasses to follow its relatively successful Ray-Ban spectacles, which can analyze a wearer’s environment and answer questions about their surroundings.

The smart glasses have been a bright spot in Meta’s largely lackluster attempts to bet early on disruptive technologies. It missed out on the smartphone in the early 2000s. Then in 2021, the company tried to reorient its brand around the metaverse, which failed to reshape the internet in the way Zuckerberg had envisioned.

But Meta’s glasses appear to be catching on with consumers; Ray-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica said in July that revenue from its Meta glasses more than tripled year-over-year. And market research indicates Meta is the leading smart glasses brand by far.

Smart glasses aren’t likely to become as ubiquitous as smartphones anytime soon. But they could allow Meta to reach consumers directly, potentially reducing reliance on smartphones. That could be critical as Meta seeks to develop “personal superintelligence” — a vague term Zuckerberg has used to describe AI that “knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.”

The pressure is on as a wave of tech giants including Samsung, Google and Meta’s longtime social media rival Snap prepare to launch new smart glasses. Amazon is also developing new glasses with augmented reality, a technology that places computer graphics over real-world surroundings, according to The Information.

Meta’s AI glasses push

Meta and Ray-Ban partnered on a pair of glasses in 2021 called the Ray-Ban Stories that were primarily designed for capturing photos and videos hands-free. But Meta was far from the first to explore using glasses for tasks like snapping photos, making calls and listening to music without reaching for your phone.

Snap and Amazon, in addition to a wave of smaller tech firms, have all released smart glasses for these purposes. Google was an early entrant in 2013 with Google Glass, although that device was unpopular with consumers because of its high price, unfashionable look, limited functionality and short battery life.

Tech giants believe this new wave of smart glasses will be different. The technologies required to power the glasses – like processors, batteries and cameras – are now easier to fit in smaller, more lightweight designs at a much lower price than Google Glass.

But AI advancements have been primarily driving these new smart glasses. Virtual assistants that can answer questions based on a user’s surroundings nearly instantly have made smart glasses much more practical. With Meta’s eyewear, for example, a user can look at a pepper and ask whether it’s spicy, or read a sign and ask Meta’s AI assistant to translate it into a different language.

Meta is said to be developing new smart glasses that include a display for viewing apps and notifications and a wristband for easier gesture control, according to Bloomberg. Meta will likely announce these spectacles at the Connect conference, which it said will focus on the “latest innovations in AI glasses,” among other things. Last year, the company announced a prototype for its Orion augmented reality glasses.

Meta declined to comment on potential plans to announce new glasses at this week’s event.

The current Ray-Ban Meta glasses don’t display anything on the lenses, meaning wearers rely on audio feedback or Meta’s phone app. That could put them at a disadvantage compared to upcoming glasses like those from Google, which have a display for showing information along with providing verbal answers.

“That’s going to be another challenge,” said Guillaume Chansin, an analyst with market research firm Counterpoint Research. “Like if you want to replace a smartphone, can you really do that without having some kind of visual feedback?”

Why Meta cares so much about smart glasses

The AI boom has led to a tech industry frenzy to capitalize on the technology, as companies fear being perceived as behind the potential next big thing.

“Everybody is looking for what’s coming after the smartphone,” said Chansin.

The success of Apple’s AirPods and other wireless earbuds could strengthen the case for smart glasses. While the devices are inherently different, they serve some of the same purposes, like making calls and communicating with digital assistants without pulling out your phone.

“As we look forward, maybe smart glasses are going to evolve into the AirPods of the future,” said Melissa Otto, head of research at investment research provider S&P Global Visible Alpha.

Meta faces an uphill battle. While demand for smart glasses seems to be growing fast (ABI Research predicts the market will ship 13 million units in 2026, up from 3.3 million in 2024), they’re still a niche product. Hundreds of millions of smartphones are shipped in one quarter alone, and there’s little indication that smart glasses will ever be nearly as widely adopted.

Reality Labs, the division of Meta responsible for the company’s AI glasses and Quest virtual reality headsets, saw a $4.5 billion operating loss in the company’s fiscal second quarter of 2025. By comparison, Meta’s apps generated $583 million in revenue.

So what’s really in it for Meta? While smart glasses may not be a revenue driver right now, they could potentially set the stage for a future in which Meta is less reliant on hardware makers like Apple and Google to distribute its apps.

Meta has previously butted heads with Apple over policies related to the iPhone maker’s App Store, and Zuckerberg has previously criticized the iPhone maker’s App Store dominance.

“Apple’s (app store) stands out as the only one where one company can control what apps get on the device,” Zuckerberg said during the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit in 2022.

If glasses become the primary way people video chat and browse social media feeds, selling its own eyewear could give Meta more control over the experience.

“I look at Facebook, look at Instagram, look at Reels, Threads through my iPhone,” said Otto. “I don’t do it through a laptop. I don’t do it through smart glasses. I do it through my iPhone.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-09-25t204232z-1101917728-rc2u7aaqtwho-rtrmadp-3-meta-platforms-virtual-reality-zuckerberg.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-15 08:07:04.817467

With seven bearish indicators outweighing the single bullish one, the stock is under pressure, and our internal diagnostic score (0-10) for technicals stands at just 2.41.

News Highlights

Recent headlines in the food sector offer mixed signals for KHC:

DoorDash's aggressive consolidation in the food delivery market could reshape industry dynamics. DoorDash's $3.9 billion acquisition of Deliveroo highlights a growing trend of scale and tech-driven logistics—both of which could indirectly pressure traditional packaged goods players like .

Global food labeling reforms are gaining traction, with India and the US tightening standards for nutritional transparency. While this is a long-term trend, it may affect KHC's product positioning and marketing strategies, especially in emerging markets.

India's reliance on imported food processing machinery highlights potential vulnerabilities in global supply chains—KHC's exposure to international manufacturing could be a risk to monitor, especially with rising trade tensions and inflationary pressures.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Analyst sentiment for KHC remains neutral, with five recent ratings all at ""Neutral."" The simple average rating is 3.00, while the performance-weighted rating is 2.64. This slight divergence shows analysts are cautious but not entirely bearish, though their recommendations are not aligned with the current -6.58% price decline.

On the fundamental side, here are the key metrics and their internal diagnostic scores (0-10):

EV/EBIT: -3.53 (score 3.00) – A relatively bearish signal as the company's enterprise value is not well supported by its earnings.

Net income / Revenue: -7.93% (score 3.00) – Indicates a shrinking profit margin, which is a red flag for investors.

ROA: -0.96% (score 1.00) – A weak return on assets highlights concerns about asset utilization and profitability.

Rate of return on total assets: -7.86% (score 1.00) – Suggests the company is struggling to generate returns from its asset base.

Annualized return on total assets: -15.73% (score 1.00) – A severe underperformance in asset returns, worsening on an annualized basis.

While some factors are positive, like the Net profit attributable to parent company shareholders / Net profit: 100.04% (score 3.00), the overall score for fundamentals is 7.21, suggesting there is underlying strength, but it is not enough to offset the bearish technical and flow signals.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows suggest a nuanced picture for KHC. Big-money (institutional) flows are trending positive, with an inflow ratio of 50.75% and a positive block trend. In contrast, retail (small) flows are negative, with a 48.07% inflow ratio, indicating that retail investors are pulling back. Our internal diagnostic score for fund flows is 7.76 (good), showing a strong institutional presence but caution for smaller investors.

Key Technical Signals

The technical outlook for KHC is bleak, with seven bearish signals versus one bullish one. Here are the key internal diagnostic scores (0-10) for recent indicators:

Bullish Engulfing: 8.08 – A rare positive signal, but it was countered by more bearish patterns.

WR Overbought: 1.00 – Suggests the stock is in an overbought range, a precursor to a sell-off.

MACD Death Cross: 2.62 – A bearish momentum signal, suggesting the downward trend may persist.

Ex-Dividend Date: 1.00 – Historically weak, with a 25% win rate and average -3.03% returns in the past.

MACD Golden Cross: 1.00 – A typically bullish signal but here it scored poorly, indicating a bearish trap.

On September 28, the stock saw a Bearish Engulfing pattern, and on August 29, multiple signals—WR Overbought, MACD Golden Cross, Ex-Dividend Date, and Bullish Engulfing—appeared simultaneously, suggesting a volatile phase in the chart. The key takeaway is that the stock is in a weak technical state, and the bearish indicators heavily outnumber the bullish ones.

Meanwhile, Costco has begun strictly enforcing early shopping hours exclusively for Executive Members. Together, these moves highlight two very different approaches to driving value in membership models — one focused on added choice, the other on enforced exclusivity.

Walmart: Bundling Through Choice

Walmart announced that Walmart+ members will soon be able to select either the ad-supported Paramount+ Essential plan or Peacock Premium as part of their membership. Subscribers may switch between the two streaming services once every 90 days.

The new option marks Walmart+’s fifth anniversary and expands on a bundle that previously only offered Paramount+. Importantly, pricing remains unchanged at $12.95 per month or $98 per year.

The service continues to include other core benefits, such as free grocery delivery, free shipping with no minimum order, fuel discounts, and prescription savings. By adding flexibility without raising prices, Walmart is clearly aiming to boost engagement and retention.

Costco: Exclusivity Through Enforcement

Costco, by contrast, has taken a harder line. As of September 1, only Executive Members — who pay $130 annually versus $65 for Gold Star or Business memberships — can enter warehouses during early access hours. Gold Star and Business members are now restricted to regular opening times.

The rule was introduced earlier this summer but was loosely enforced during a grace period. September marked the beginning of strict enforcement at warehouse doors, with non-Executive members turned away if they attempt early entry.

Executive Members represent nearly half of Costco’s subscriber base but deliver a disproportionate share of sales, making enforcement a strategic push to strengthen tier economics and encourage upgrades.

Industry Context

The two announcements underscore diverging strategies in subscription and membership design:

Walmart+ is layering in additive value, expanding its bundle by giving all members access to more choice and flexibility.

Costco is enforcing exclusivity, drawing sharper lines between tiers and requiring staff intervention to uphold the policy.

Both approaches highlight how subscription and membership businesses are experimenting with levers of retention and monetization. Where Walmart is betting that flexibility deepens engagement, Costco is relying on exclusivity to push upgrades and reinforce premium tiers.

INSIDER TAKE

For subscription executives, these developments illustrate critical strategic contrasts:

Flexibility vs. Restriction: Walmart’s quarterly streaming switch is designed to feel empowering, while Costco’s early-access rule creates a clear sense of exclusion. Both approaches can drive results, but they trigger very different customer emotions.

Perceived Value vs. Perceived Penalty: Walmart enhances value without changing price, framing the perk as a reward. Costco introduces friction for lower-tier members, risking pushback but betting the exclusivity will drive upgrades.

Tier Management Lessons: Costco demonstrates the revenue potential of enforcing premium tiers — but also the reputational risk. Walmart shows how a flat membership can still grow stickier through partnerships and flexible benefits.

The Bundling Imperative: Walmart’s partnership with both Paramount+ and Peacock reflects a larger trend: cross-industry alliances are becoming table stakes in consumer membership models. For subscription leaders, the lesson is to evaluate not just what’s bundled, but how much flexibility customers have in consuming those bundles.

The takeaway: loyalty programs and memberships are evolving in two distinct directions — additive flexibility and enforced exclusivity. Both can work, but each carries very different risks and rewards.",https://www.subscriptioninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Walmart-2-1920-x-1670.png,N,,2025-09-14 17:06:14.292857

However, Q2 2025 S&P 500 earnings season has exceeded expectations, with both earnings and revenues surprising to the upside. Earnings outperformance was led by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare, supported by AI adoption, a rebound in digital advertising, and steady underlying demand.

Bullish and bearish indicators are in a standoff, with a weak technical outlook and mixed price momentum.

(BSX) is currently down 2.64%, trading in a volatile pattern that suggests investors should be cautious and watch for clearer signals.

News Highlights

Recent news in the healthcare sector has been mixed, but here are a few key stories worth noting:

Healthcare Infrastructure Financing: Stanford Health Care announced a $424.9 million municipal bond sale to fund projects and refund debt. While this doesn’t directly affect , it shows continued investment in the healthcare infrastructure, which could bode well for long-term demand.

AI in Healthcare Billing: Healthpoint Ventures, a Tennessee-based startup, is using AI to streamline healthcare billing, partnering with regional providers like Williamson Health. Innovations like this could indirectly benefit medical device companies like Boston Scientific by boosting overall sector efficiency and growth.

Competitive Moves in Medical Devices: saw a price uptick after Boston Scientific announced the discontinuation of its rival heart-valve replacement systems. This kind of competitive shift can impact market sentiment and stock performance.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Analysts remain divided but leaning toward optimism, with a simple average rating of 4.50 and a performance-weighted rating of 5.62. However, this optimism contrasts with the current price drop, which shows the market's expectations are not fully aligned with near-term stock performance.

Fundamental Highlights

Price-to-Sales (PS) ratio: 28.90 (value: 28.89) with an internal diagnostic score of 1. High PS may signal overvaluation or strong revenue expectations.

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 15.71% (value: 0.1571) with a strong internal diagnostic score of 3. Healthy profitability remains a key strength.

Return on Assets (ROA): 1.91% (value: 0.0191) with a moderate internal diagnostic score of 2. Suggests decent but not exceptional asset utilization.

Return on Equity (ROE): 3.51% (value: 0.0351) with a moderate internal diagnostic score of 1. ROE is relatively low, indicating room for improvement in shareholder returns.

Cash flow from operations to assets (Cash-UP): 90.37% (value: 0.9037) with a strong internal diagnostic score of 3. Strong operational cash flow is a positive sign.

Money-Flow Trends

Big-money investors and institutional flows are showing a negative trend, with all sizes of inflows—small, medium, large, and extra-large—slightly below 50%. The fund-flow score of 7.59 (good) indicates that while large-scale investors are pulling back, the overall flow still shows some strength in retail and smaller institutional buying.

Key Technical Signals

The technical outlook for BSX remains weak and volatile, with more bearish indicators than bullish ones active in the last five days.

Internal Diagnostic Scores

Williams %R Overbought: internal diagnostic score of 3.2 — suggesting limited upside potential.

MACD Death Cross: internal diagnostic score of 2.2 — bearish momentum is gaining strength.

Bullish Engulfing: internal diagnostic score of 2.67 — typically a bullish candlestick pattern but currently leaning bearish.

Shooting Star: internal diagnostic score of 7.27 — a strong bearish reversal signal.

Hanging Man: internal diagnostic score of 7.17 — also a bearish top reversal pattern.

Recent Chart Patterns

2025-09-03: Hanging Man and WR Overbought signals suggest a potential top in the short term.

2025-09-09: A Shooting Star pattern appears — a red flag for bearish reversal.

2025-09-11: WR Oversold and MACD Death Cross signals suggest the stock is overextended and likely to correct.

Technical Summary

Headline Takeaway:

(ECL) is in a technical neutral zone, with no strong directional signal from recent indicators. The price has fallen by 1.60% recently, which contrasts with a relatively balanced analyst sentiment.

News Highlights

Recent news highlights include significant policy shifts in the U.S. regarding Covid-19 vaccines, the Trump administration’s push to fast-track uranium mining in Utah, and developments around Ethereum and

ETFs by REX Shares. These events reflect broader market uncertainty, especially around regulatory and policy changes, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s operations in the industrial and healthcare sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab has received a simple average analyst rating of 3.67 and a performance-weighted rating of 3.26. The ratings are relatively neutral to slightly positive, but there is notable dispersion in analyst views, with one ""Neutral"" and two ""Buy"" ratings over the past 20 days. This divergence doesn’t strongly align with the recent price drop of 1.60%, indicating mixed expectations among market participants.

Key fundamental factors include:

Price-to-Earnings (PE): 148.64 – Score: 0.00 (internal diagnostic score). High valuation relative to earnings.

Cost of sales ratio: 55.48% – Score: 1.00. Suggests moderate cost burden.

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities per Share YoY): -14.74% – Score: 2.00. Indicates a sharp decline in operating cash flow.

Fixed assets turnover ratio: 2.01 – Score: 1.00. Suggests efficient use of fixed assets.

Cash-UP (Cash to Market Value): 0.65 – Score: 3.00. Indicates a moderate liquidity position.

Money-Flow Trends

Big-money and retail flow patterns for Ecolab show a negative overall trend, with all major investor categories (Large, Extra-large,

.) showing outflows. The overall inflow ratio is 47.43%, which suggests that even within the negative trend, some inflows are happening, but not enough to reverse the pattern. This could indicate cautious positioning by institutional players and retreating confidence from smaller investors.

Key Technical Signals

From a technical perspective, Ecolab’s chart shows no bullish signals, but one bearish signal and one neutral signal. The most recent indicators include:

WR Oversold – Internal diagnostic score: 3.71 (neutral rise, 53.66% win rate, avg. return: 0.33%).

Bearish Engulfing – Internal diagnostic score: 6.56 (neutral rise, 62.5% win rate, avg. return: 0.84%).

Recent chart patterns over the last 5 days show multiple instances of WR Oversold (on 9/10, 9/03, 9/02, 9/09) and one Bearish Engulfing on 9/05. These suggest that while the market is not decisively bearish, volatility and lack of direction are key features of the current technical landscape. The overall trend is neutral, and traders are advised to wait for a clearer signal before committing to a position.

Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point Corteva's potential split represents more than a corporate restructuring—it is a recalibration of risk and growth in an industry at a crossroads.","Corporate restructuring has long served as a catalyst for unlocking value in capital-intensive industries, and agribusiness is no exception.

Agriscience, the $50-billion agribusiness giant formed from the 2019 merger of Dow and DuPont's agricultural divisions, is reportedly exploring a strategic split of its seed and pesticide operations into two distinct entities Report: Corteva Agriscience is Looking to Breakup Its Seed[ 5 ]. This move, if executed, would align with broader industry trends toward specialization, ESG compliance, and liability mitigation while addressing investor demands for clarity in an increasingly fragmented market.

Industry Trends: Specialization and ESG-Driven Restructuring

The agribusiness sector has seen a surge in corporate restructurings in 2025, driven by the need to address climate risks, regulatory pressures, and evolving investor expectations. Companies like

and have similarly pursued spin-offs or divestitures to streamline operations and focus on core competencies . For Corteva, separating its seed and pesticide businesses could insulate its high-growth seed division from potential liabilities tied to crop protection products, a strategy mirrored by Bayer AG's earlier restructuring efforts Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ].

This shift reflects a broader industry pivot toward specialization. Precision agriculture, biotechnology, and sustainable practices are redefining competitive advantages, with investors increasingly favoring companies that demonstrate clear ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) progress. Corteva's 2024 Impact Report underscores this trend, highlighting innovations such as drought-resistant seeds and biocontrol agents that align with global sustainability goals Report: Corteva Agriscience is Looking to Breakup Its Seed[ 5 ]. By isolating its seed business, Corteva could amplify its ESG narrative, a critical factor in attracting capital amid heightened scrutiny of agricultural chemical footprints.

Financial Implications: Sharper Focus, Enhanced Returns

Corteva's financial framework through 2027 emphasizes cost reductions, productivity gains, and $4.5 billion in shareholder returns Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. A split could accelerate these objectives by allowing each business unit to optimize capital allocation. For instance, the seed division—responsible for $9.5 billion of Corteva's 2024 sales—might reinvest more aggressively in gene editing and biologicals, while the pesticide unit could prioritize compliance with tightening regulations on chemical usage.

Historical case studies reinforce this logic. Bayer's separation of its crop science division in 2018, though later merged again, initially boosted investor confidence by clarifying operational risks and growth prospects Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. Similarly, Corteva's proposed split could create two distinct investment vehicles: a pure-play seed company with recurring revenue streams and a crop protection firm focused on innovation in low-impact solutions. This duality may appeal to a broader range of investors, from those prioritizing long-term agricultural resilience to those seeking short-term gains in high-margin chemical markets.

ESG Compliance: A Dual-Track Strategy for Sustainability

Environmental liabilities have become a defining challenge for agribusinesses. Corteva's pesticide division, while profitable, faces mounting pressure from regulators and advocacy groups over the ecological impacts of synthetic chemicals. By decoupling this unit, the company could redirect resources toward its seed business, which is central to addressing food security and climate adaptation.

The split also aligns with Corteva's 2027 ESG targets, including $1 billion in cost savings from sustainable practices Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. For example, its advancements in bee vectoring technology and biofertilizers—highlighted in the 2024 Investor Day presentation—position the seed division as a leader in regenerative agriculture Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the pesticide unit could adopt stricter compliance protocols, such as those seen in Bayer's recent herbicide innovations, to mitigate reputational risks Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. This dual-track approach ensures both units contribute to ESG goals without diluting their core missions.

Investor Confidence: Balancing Risk and Reward

Investor sentiment toward agribusiness has grown more nuanced in recent years. While commodity prices and weather volatility remain concerns, stakeholders now prioritize companies that demonstrate adaptability to systemic risks. Corteva's proposed split addresses this by reducing ambiguity around liability exposure—a critical factor in a sector where litigation over chemical safety has cost firms billions.

Data from Corteva's 2024 financials reveals a 40% revenue split between seeds ($9.5 billion) and pesticides ($7.4 billion) . A separation would allow each unit to be valued independently, potentially unlocking hidden equity value. For instance, the seed business's recurring revenue model and R&D pipeline in gene editing could command a premium valuation, while the pesticide unit's focus on compliance-driven innovation might attract investors seeking stable cash flows in a regulated environment.

Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point

Corteva's potential split represents more than a corporate restructuring—it is a recalibration of risk and growth in an industry at a crossroads. By aligning with ESG imperatives, embracing specialization, and addressing liability concerns, the company could position itself as a leader in the next phase of agribusiness evolution. For investors, the move offers a clearer lens to assess value creation in two distinct but complementary markets. As the agribusiness sector navigates the dual pressures of climate change and technological disruption, Corteva's decision may well set a precedent for how legacy firms adapt to secure long-term relevance.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757739219976.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-13 21:02:40.669310

Separating its crop-seed unit from its pesticide business could help shield its seeds from any potential future liabilities associated with its pest and weed-killing chemicals, the report said, adding that the company is expected to reveal plans soon, barring any last-minute snags.

Dive Brief:

Kroger will fuel modernization with AI as it deploys use cases to operate more efficiently, improve customer experience and boost sales, executives said during the grocer’s Q2 2025 earnings call Thursday.

“Accelerating our AI efforts is a natural step for Kroger, given our long history of leadership in data and machine learning,” Chairman and interim CEO Ron Sargent said Thursday. “Where we’ve implemented AI in different parts of the organization, we’re seeing results with more competitive pricing, shrink improvements and faster fulfillment.”

Cost optimization and operational efficiencies are top priorities for the grocer as it looks to move forward from its failed merger with Albertsons. Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 3.4%during the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of increase for this metric. The company also raised its identical sales growth forecast for the 2025 fiscal year.

Dive Insight:

Grocers, like other retailers, have increased their appetite for emerging technologies as leaders look to alleviate the effects of economic headwinds and add a competitive edge.

In April, Albertsons executives said the company was strengthening its data capabilities in pursuit of AI adoption. Walmart and Instacart have also worked to scale AI capabilities.

Kroger credits its “couple decades worth” of loyalty program data, a “deep bench of data science capability” and its 84.51° division for laying the foundation for its AI efforts, EVP and CFO David Kennerley said during the call Thursday.

Despite the focus on modernization, Kroger has reduced staff in related departments. In August, workers in Kroger’s Technology and Digital division were impacted. The company also laid off employees in 84.51°, the grocer’s retail analytics subsidiary, in March. The reduction in staff was an effort to “focus on the key priorities that power our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson told Grocery Dive.

Looking forward, Kroger plans to examine “all aspects” of its business to drive efficiencies, including a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfillment network, Sargent said during the latest earnings call.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/DPPUFEmJwyzXrW2tAT8kv6PfEIptANymLaTNFlzmgCo/g:nowe:0:0/c:2027:1145/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMzQ0My5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-12 16:09:19.858098

Zacks Investment Research","Colgate-Palmolive Company’s CL newly announced productivity program reflects its commitment to building a “future-fit” organization as part of its 2030 strategic plan. Even amid a challenging operating environment characterized by high raw material and packaging costs, tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty, Colgate has continued to deliver solid growth in net sales, organic sales and earnings per share. The program targets $300–$400 million in incremental savings by 2025, designed to complement ongoing revenue growth management (RGM) and funding-the-growth initiatives, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently while maintaining focus on long-term brand and category development.

The core strategy of the productivity program revolves around cost-saving and efficiency initiatives that strengthen Colgate’s operational foundation. These include optimizing the global supply chain for greater agility and resilience, leveraging AI and data analytics to enhance portfolio and promotional decisions, and prioritizing investments in high-return areas. By streamlining processes, improving pricing and mix strategies, and reducing overhead, Colgate aims to generate incremental savings that can either be reinvested in innovation and brand-building or applied directly to the bottom line. The program also emphasizes strategic use of price pack architecture, such as multipacks and smaller sizes, to meet evolving consumer needs while enhancing profitability.

Colgate’s productivity initiative is expected to drive long-term growth and efficiency by enabling it to navigate volatile markets while sustaining organic sales momentum. By combining cost discipline with strategic investment in core innovation, AI-driven RGM and digital capabilities, Colgate can enhance household penetration, maintain brand health and support consistent compounded earnings per share growth. If executed effectively, this program positions Colgate not only to weather near-term challenges but also to strengthen its competitive advantage and long-term profitability.

GIS is likely to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Sept. 17.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 81 cents per share, indicating a decrease of 24.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.

The consensus estimate for General Mills’ quarterly revenues is pegged at $4.50 billion, which indicates a 7.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.

Things to Know About GIS’ Q1 Earnings

General Mills operates in a highly competitive and price-sensitive food industry, where grocery inflation is weighing heavily on consumer spending. Reduced discretionary food spending by budget-conscious consumers remains a major obstacle to volume recovery. The company is also grappling with macroeconomic and operational headwinds across international markets, especially in China, where consumer demand remains subdued.

Additionally, sluggish trends in the U.S. snacking categories and softer demand in the away-from-home foodservice channel have further added to the company’s challenges. Persistence of such trends remains a concern for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We expect price/mix to drop 1.8% and volume to decline 1.2% in the fiscal first quarter.

However, General Mills is leveraging brand strength, innovation, cost savings and portfolio reshaping to enhance market share. The company has unveiled a multi-year global transformation initiative, part of its Accelerate strategy, to fuel growth. While General Mills has implemented cost-saving initiatives under its Holistic Margin Management strategy, persistent inflationary pressures continue to impact its performance. These broad-based cost challenges, combined with weakening consumer demand and tariff woes, underscore the tough landscape facing General Mills in the near term.

Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE: BDX) is a heavyweight in the global medical technology game. The business is split into three key segments: BD Medical (think syringes, needles, and devices that keep hospitals humming), BD Life Sciences (diagnostics and biosciences kits), and BD Interventional (surgical and critical care gadgets). BD gets its products into the hands of hospitals, clinical labs, pharma companies, and more, using a mix of direct sales teams in big markets and distributors everywhere else. Revenue comes from items you buy often (like disposable needles), big-ticket machines (such as infusion pumps and diagnostic analyzers), and extra services (analytics, consulting). The medtech and diagnostics space is built on steady demand from aging populations, rising chronic illness, and constant innovation. BD’s main rivals include Medtronic, Abbott, Baxter, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Stryker, and Edwards Lifesciences. Thanks to its diverse lineup and global reach, BD has a solid competitive moat—recurring sales, close ties with customers, and enough scale to hold onto pricing power in a lot of product lines.

Recent Performance

From September 2024 to September 11, 2025, BD's shares fell by 17.89%, while the S&P 500 rose 14.92%. This slump mainly comes down to shrinking valuation multiples and worries about near-term growth, especially in BD’s Life Sciences unit (with rumors of a possible divestiture swirling around). Tech stocks and growth names have been in vogue, widening the gap even further.

BD’s revenue isn’t exactly sprinting—it’s grown a modest 4.8% over the past year, lagging behind the broader market’s 8.7%. The Medical segment is the bright spot, riding a rebound in elective procedures, with third quarter sales up 5.1% year-over-year. BD’s poised to boost its intensive care unit presence with the $900 million-a-year Critical Care business from Edwards Lifesciences (deal expected to close by end-2024). Meanwhile, BD’s looking to offload its $21 billion biosciences and diagnostics business—a move that could free up capital for faster-growing areas, with a deal targeted for late 2025.

Quality & Moat

BD’s operating margin stands at 11.3%—a bit higher than its five-year average (10.5%) but trailing the market’s 18.2%. Returns are modest: return on invested capital (ROIC) is 4.8%, just above BD’s past five-year average but well below the market’s 11.1%. The consumables franchise keeps recurring cash flowing, but free cash flow yield has dipped to –4.1% (historic average is +1.4%), mainly due to inventory build-up and working capital needs. CEO Tom Polen has kept a tight rein, returning around $1.1 billion through dividends and $0.5 billion via buybacks in 2024, while still investing in research and strategic deals.

Valuation

BD trades at a forward P/E of 31.1×—a premium over the market’s 26.0×—thanks to its defensive business model and reliable cash flow, though there’s not much room for near-term upside. The EV/Sales ratio is 3.2×, below both BD’s five-year average (4.1×) and the market’s (4.6×), hinting at some valuation cushion if growth picks up. The high earnings multiple is partly justified by BD’s low beta (0.55) and steady revenues, but negative free cash flow puts a question mark on margins and capital efficiency.

Market Sentiment

Analyst opinion is split: most stick to ‘Hold,’ with average price targets about 5% above the current share price. Short interest is tame at 2% of float, so there’s not much bearish betting. Big institutions own around 85% of the shares, and insider buying has been quiet. News about the potential Life Sciences divestiture has kept the stock in check, though if management executes cleanly, investors see the move as adding value.

Key Risks

High leverage and working capital strain: BDX’s net debt sits at 3.8× EBITDA—much higher than the market average of 1.4×. That eats into financial flexibility and ups the refinancing risk if interest rates stay high.

Moderate profitability metrics: ROIC of 4.8% and operating margins of about 11.3% don’t stack up well next to medtech peers (averaging around 18%), so free cash flow will probably stay muted until margins improve.

Execution risk on divestitures: Spinning off the Life Sciences business won’t be easy. Tax-friendly structures like a reverse Morris trust could complicate things, dragging out timelines and drawing management’s eye from the core business.

Competitive pressures and pricing: Fierce competition from heavyweights like Medtronic, Abbott, Thermo Fisher—and upstarts too—could put pressure on prices for BD’s bread-and-butter products.

Regulatory and litigation exposure: BD is in a tightly regulated industry. Product recalls, legal battles, or new healthcare rules could inflate costs and ding the company’s reputation.

Bull Case

Defensive, recurring revenue base: A big chunk of sales comes from consumables and disposables—which keeps cash coming in, even when the economy wobbles.

Strategic M&A and portfolio optimization: Adding Edwards’ Critical Care business should strengthen growth. Shedding slower-growing assets could unlock value and sharpen BD’s focus on its core medtech strengths.

Operational improvement initiatives: Management’s ‘grow, simplify, empower’ strategy is underway, aiming to fatten up margins by streamlining manufacturing and tightening up the supply chain.

Shareholder returns: BD keeps shareholders sweet with dividends and buybacks. If it pockets extra cash from asset sales, expect more buybacks.

Valuation support: With the EV/Sales ratio below its own history and the broader market average, there’s a potential cushion if growth stabilizes.

Bear Case

Valuation premium: A forward P/E of 31× is steep — even if EV/Sales looks cheap by comparison. Unless the multiple expands, there’s a ceiling on upside.

Negative free cash flow: Building up working capital and snapping up new businesses has pushed cash flow into the red, raising doubts about how sustainable BD’s cash generation really is.

Execution risks on divestitures: If spinning off the Life Sciences unit drags on or gets muddled, BD could stay stuck in the slow lane with too much complexity.

Margin pressure: Underwhelming profits from diagnostics and biosciences may need a restructuring—and that could mean spending cuts that crimp future growth.

High debt burden: At roughly 4× EBITDA, BD’s leverage magnifies risks from higher interest rates and ties its hands on new investments.

On Our Radar

Q4 FY 2025 earnings release: Expected in late November 2025. Investors will be keen to see how organic growth and margin guidance are shaping up during BD’s ongoing portfolio shakeup.

Life Sciences divestiture decision: Due by the end of 2025. How BD chooses to spin off, sell, or structure its Life Sciences business will play a huge role in shaping capital allocation and valuation.

Waters Corporation merger close: Watch for the sale of BD’s biosciences division to Waters for $17.5 billion—expected by the first quarter of 2026. Keep an eye on deal progress and how the proceeds get used.

FDA approvals for new devices: Clearances for new infusion pumps and diagnostics, expected late in 2025, could give BD some extra sales momentum.

Investment Conclusion

BDX stands out as a defensive medtech player, anchored by steady consumables revenue and a history of disciplined capital returns. But growth has cooled off, and the balance sheet carries a heavy load—negative free cash flow and profitability that trails the peer group. Long-term investors might see potential for value if management nails its next round of acquisitions in critical care and successfully sheds slower-growing assets. Near-term, though, there’s no escaping the risks tied to portfolio moves and premium price tags. Patient, risk-aware investors might want to wait for a clearer path—possibly accumulating shares on dips, once BD’s portfolio puzzle pieces have locked into place, balancing the company’s steady income stream against its debt and slimmer margins.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-12 12:26:18.613126

Takeaway:

(ECL) shows signs of technical neutrality with a wait-and-see stance, and recent price action has fallen by -4.03%. While bullish and bearish indicators are nearly balanced, investors are advised to monitor market changes closely.

News Highlights

Recent global and economic developments could influence Ecolab’s performance. Here are a few highlights:

U.S. vaccine policy changes are expected to impact public health and healthcare sectors. While not directly related to Ecolab, these shifts may influence overall market sentiment.

Trump’s fast-tracking of a Utah uranium mine signals a potential shift in energy policy and resource development, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s industrial and environmental clients.

China’s factory activity contracted in May, but signs of recovery are emerging. A slowdown in global manufacturing could affect Ecolab’s international business operations.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab’s recent analyst ratings are mixed, with three institutions offering differing perspectives:

Simple average rating: 3.67 (indicating a cautiously bullish bias)

Performance-weighted rating: 3.26 (showing analysts with stronger historical performance have slightly more bearish expectations)

Rating consistency: Analysts are not aligned—two “Buy” ratings and one “Neutral” rating are currently active.

This mixed analyst sentiment contrasts with the recent 4.03% price decline, suggesting a misalignment between market expectations and current price movements.

Key fundamental values and scores:

Return on Assets (ROA): 2.23% (internal diagnostic score: 3.0)

Cash flow from operations (CFOA): 2.96% (score: 3.0)

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 31.89% (score: 2.0)

Current assets turnover ratio: 1.18x (score: 3.0)

Non-current liabilities / Total liabilities: 65.88% (score: 2.0)

Ecolab’s fundamentals are mixed, with stronger performance in operating cash flow and turnover, but moderate profitability and heavy long-term liabilities.

Money-Flow Trends

Ecolab has experienced negative fund-flow trends across all investor categories, with retail investors (small) contributing the least inflow at 48.57% and large and extra-large investors contributing 47.46% and 46.25% respectively. The overall inflow ratio stands at 46.91%, suggesting a cautious stance among big players. The negative trend in all categories reinforces the idea that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, especially with mixed technical and fundamental signals.

Key Technical Signals

Technical analysis reveals a complex and neutral setup for Ecolab:

WR Oversold: Shows an internal diagnostic score of 3.94—a moderate strength signal with a 55.0% win rate and an average return of 0.38% over historical signals.

Bearish Engulfing: This pattern shows a stronger bullish bias with a 7.82 score—a 71.43% win rate and an average return of 1.17% when activated.

Looking at recent patterns, the Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern was activated on 2025-09-05, alongside a recurring WR Oversold signal. These signals have appeared frequently in the past five days, indicating a volatile but indecisive market.

Key insight: Technical indicators are showing a balanced mix of long and short signals, with no clear trend emerging. Investors are advised to monitor developments closely and be ready for sudden swings.

Companies (EL) has embarked on a bold transformation under its newly appointed leadership team, with innovation at the core of its ""Beauty Reimagined"" strategy. This strategic pivot, introduced in February 2025, aims to restore sustainable sales growth and rebuild stakeholder confidence after years of declining performance. For investors, the question is whether this leadership evolution—marked by a focus on disruptive technologies, agile execution, and consumer-centric innovation—can translate into long-term shareholder value.

Leadership Realignment: A Foundation for Change

The appointment of Stéphane de La Faverie as CEO in January 2025 signaled a decisive shift in EL's corporate direction. De La Faverie, a veteran of LVMH and L'Oréal, brings a track record of scaling luxury beauty brands. His leadership has been paired with the hiring of René Lammers, Ph.D., as Executive Vice President and Chief Research & Innovation Officer, a role critical to advancing EL's innovation agendaRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ]. Lammers' expertise in science-based platforms and global R&D partnerships aligns with the company's goal of accelerating product development cycles and capturing emerging trendsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ].

This leadership realignment has already yielded tangible results. For fiscal 2025, equity awards tied to performance metrics were earned at 70.1% of the target, reflecting progress toward strategic goals despite a challenging operating environment[PRE 14A] The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Preliminary Proxy Statement[ 2 ]. While this fell short of the initial 100% target, it underscores the performance-based nature of leadership incentives and the company's commitment to accountability.

Innovation-Driven Growth: From Lab to Market

EL's innovation strategy under ""Beauty Reimagined"" is not just about product launches—it's about redefining the beauty industry's relationship with consumers. In fiscal 2025, the company rolled out breakthrough products such as La Mer's Night Recovery Concentrate and the M·A·C Nudes Collection, both designed to address evolving consumer preferences for personalized, science-backed solutionsThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ]. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to expand ""consumer coverage"" through digital platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon's U.S. and Canadian Premium Beauty storesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ].

is prioritizing long-term innovation over short-term profitability—a risky but potentially rewarding bet.

Strategic Risks and Rewards

The path to restoring growth is fraught with challenges. EL's fiscal 2025 results highlight the difficulty of competing in a saturated beauty market, where consumer spending remains fragmented across categories. Yet the company's focus on ""disruptive technologies"" and collaborations with academic institutionsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ] suggests a willingness to invest in high-impact R&D. This approach mirrors successful models in tech and pharma, where breakthrough innovation drives decades of value.

A critical test will be the execution of ""Beauty Reimagined"" in fiscal 2026. The company has signaled optimism about returning to positive sales growth after three years of declinesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ], but this will require not only compelling products but also disciplined cost management.

The Bottom Line for Investors

For long-term investors, Estee Lauder's leadership evolution presents a compelling case study in balancing innovation with accountability. While fiscal 2025 results were lackluster, the company's strategic pivot—led by a seasoned CEO and a visionary R&D leader—positions it to capitalize on the $500 billion global beauty market's next wave of disruption.

However, this breakneck expansion is creating significant challenges, including a pervasive trust deficit, rising operational costs, and critical governance gaps that organizations are struggling to address.

“As organizations scale Agentic AI, they need to focus on priorities that deliver meaningful value with non-regrettable risk. This requires a unified enterprise framework that ensures consistent standards for ethics, access, orchestration, and observability,” said Craig Suckling, Chief AI Officer of Capgemini Europe.

Generative AI adoption reaches global scale

Generative AI has transitioned from experimental pilots to core business operations at a remarkable pace. Adoption has surged from a mere 6% of organizations in 2023 to 30% in 2025, representing a fivefold increase in just two years.

Currently, a significant percentage, which is 93% of companies, are actively investigating, experimenting with, or deploying GenAI capabilities in their operations. Industries such as telecommunications, consumer goods, and aerospace and defense are leaders in customer operations, marketing, and IT.

This is being driven by substantial and increasing investment, and most organizations report tangible benefits. Eighty-eight percent of organizations are spending more on GenAI, on average, 9% more investments in the last year, with 12% of the total IT budget allocated to the technology.

The returns are also evident, with 79% of organizations expressing satisfaction with their Gen AI results, citing increased innovation and productivity benefits.

Trust and governance gaps threaten AI scaling

Despite rapid adoption, a significant trust barrier prevents the full-scale deployment of autonomous AI systems.

Only 71% of organizations claim to be able to trust autonomous AI agents to be used in the enterprise to the full extent. It is due to security worries of 65%, the risk of privacy of 62%, and the threat of biased results of 51% that this skepticism is based on the deeper fear of relinquishing control without any verifiable assurances.

The lack of trust is complicated by a general inability to introduce efficient governance structures. Although almost half, which is 46% of organizations, have developed AI governance policies, nearly half of them, which is 47% are concerned that their employees rarely adhere to them.

Furthermore, governance is inconsistently applied across business functions in 47% of organizations, and dedicated oversight bodies, like a Chief AI Officer or an ethics committee, are found in only a minority of firms, leaving AI systems without adequate guardrails or accountability.

For the first time, it is expanding its franchise operations into Asia, in partnership with SPC Group, a South Korea-based food company. Through this accretive partnership, CMG plans to open the first Chipotle restaurants in South Korea and Singapore in 2026.

The collaboration is strategically important because it provides Chipotle with an existing supply chain, operational support and knowledge of the local market — all of which will help mitigate the execution risks that accompany global expansion. Besides, the growing brand awareness among consumers for the company — thanks to Korean band artists — has bolstered this strategic move.

This project lays the foundation for further growth throughout Asia, which could prove to be a significant long-term growth engine and revenue diversification opportunity for Chipotle.

Chipotle’s Footprint Expansion Initiatives

Chipotle continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy by delivering exceptional food and hospitality as well as minimizing its expenses. It remains committed to improving the guest experience, emphasizing value and strengthening brand relevance in a challenging consumer environment. Looking ahead, the company plans to further highlight its value proposition by introducing new menu innovations, expanding its loyalty program and rolling out targeted marketing campaigns.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Chipotle advanced its expansion strategy by opening 61 new restaurants across the United States and Canada, including 47 Chipotlanes, and reaffirmed its target of 315 to 345 new openings for the year. The company is also deepening its international presence through strategic partnerships. In Mexico, Chipotle is collaborating with Alsea, a leading restaurant operator in Latin America and Europe, with the debut location expected to open in early 2026. In the Middle East, its partnership with Alshaya Group is set to accelerate development in the back half of 2025. Together, these initiatives provide a gateway into high-potential growth markets and strengthen Chipotle’s ability to extend its brand globally.

Shares of CMG have declined 22.7% in the past six months against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 12.7% rise. Also, weakening consumer confidence, tariff pressures and high expenses are a concern. Going forward, Chipotle intends to leverage digital programs to expand access and customer convenience.

So maybe it should not have been a surprise that just over two weeks after she wore a black-and-white striped Ralph Lauren sundress for her flower-festooned engagement shoot — one that sold out almost immediately — Ralph Lauren himself opened New York Fashion Week with a collection almost entirely black and white. And red.

After more than 50 years in business, he understands how to up the ante. And so he did, with volume and celebrities and some very, very wide-brimmed straw hats.

The show was held in the Lauren headquarters on Madison Avenue, in a room transformed for the day into a summery lounge with cushioned white couches, black wicker chandeliers and a curvy staircase at one end. The intimacy of the site only served to highlight the big picture view.

Nick Jonas sat with a hand on his wife Priyanka Chopra’s knee, each in matching shades of Ralph Lauren brown. Mindy Kaling, in a bronze suit, Naomi Watts, in a frilly shell, and Jessica Chastain, in black lace, whispered into one another’s ears and giggled. At the last minute, Oprah made her entrance with Gayle King. And all of them applauded the acres of material in Mr. Lauren’s generous trousers, sweeping skirts and halter tent gowns.

The palette may have been limited, but there was nothing constricting about the clothes — a relief at a time when the corset has been making a comeback, body-con is a trend and skinny trousers abound. There was even a very fancy pair of satiny white overalls, worn over a crystal-bedecked white tank, in case someone wanted to go straight from the garden to the gala.

Rather than looking blousey, or even bombastic, the effect was easy. Especially because all the swishiness at the bottom was balanced by bandeau tops, neatly tailored jackets and the occasional pair of shorts. Also, statement silver jewelry in organic shapes and some floppy bows.

These were pared-down pieces for someone who believes that harmony can be found in oppositions and is confident enough not to try too hard. That’s the essence of sportswear, which is itself part of the essence of American fashion, and Mr. Lauren understands it as well as anyone.

In any case, if Mr. Lauren was channeling a growth mind-set, it made sense. The only thing bigger than his pants and hats was his last few weeks, between Ms. Swift’s surprise announcement and the U.S. Open, where he celebrated 20 years as official outfitter and dressed a plethora of high-profile attendees.

Meantime, he introduced a new A.I. tool that can help customers style their Polo looks (the company had reportedly been working on it for a year, in conjunction with Microsoft), and on the day of his show news came that he was nominated for a Council of Fashion Designers of America award as women’s wear designer of the year. This after already winning in the category nine times.

As to whether he was also looking forward to creating Ms. Swift’s wedding dress, a spokeswoman smiled, shrugged and remained mum.

No matter.

Kroger Co. raised its full-year sales forecast, illustrating that the grocer is attracting value-seeking consumers who are opting to eat at home.

The company said it now expects comparable sales, excluding fuel, to gain as much as 3.4%, versus its previous guidance calling for a high of 3.25% increase.

Kroger’s shares rose as much as 4.4% in premarket trading.

Kroger ranks No. 31 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America, and No. 3 on the TT grocery list.

Food retailers have posted steady sales in recent years, benefiting from shoppers prioritizing necessities even as they cut spending elsewhere. People are staying cautious overall, buying things on sale or purchasing cheaper items.

The grocery chain’s comparable sales and adjusted earnings beat expectations during the latest quarter, driven by higher sales of fresh food, e-commerce and pharmacy.

Kroger is seeking to establish a new chapter of growth after calling off a $24.6 billion deal with rival Albertsons Cos., a fight that’s now unfolding in court. Kroger’s former chief executive abruptly resigned earlier this year, replaced by industry veteran Ron Sargent until a permanent CEO is named.

Albertsons ranks No. 5 on the grocery carriers list.

Under Sargent, the Cincinnati company has been sharpening focus on the core retail business. It’s accelerating new store openings while closing underperforming ones. Improving e-commerce profitability is another priority, as Kroger works to reduce wait times and move online orders faster. Kroger said in August that it would lay off nearly 1,000 corporate employees to cut costs.

While Kroger has less exposure to tariffs than competitors selling clothes and other general merchandise, the retailer is diversifying sourcing and discontinuing some items in response. The grocer is also emphasizing value, offering promotions, lowering prices and expanding store brands that continue to grow faster than national names. Still, competition has been growing as Walmart Inc. offers more food discounts and Amazon.com Inc. plans to expand grocery delivery offerings.

Browne, an early beta tester of the new Digital Landscapes experience, was able to do.
Insights Designed to Drive Business Results Suppliers can view aggregate metrics on their full Walmart product slate or drill down to the single UPC level.
What’s not available are competitors’ metrics, for obvious reasons, but Lomelino said that with the new search insights, brands will be able to learn a lot about category-level behavior.
“They can allocate their digital spend more effectively, because they understand the digital journey much better with the insights that we provide,” said Lomelino.","There’s been talk for some time about the collapse of the traditional “funnel.” Consumers no longer move along a linear path from awareness to consideration to purchase, and they haven’t for years. Now, with the rise of AI-powered search and discovery, that path to purchase is becoming even more fragmented and variable. But regardless of how ecommerce evolves from here, core hubs of commerce activity and intel will remain — and one of those hubs is the app and website of the world’s largest retailer, Walmart.

Walmart’s digital platforms feature 20 million first-party items that are shopped by millions of consumers every week. That’s a lot of insight into what consumers are looking for and ultimately buying. For years now, Walmart has been working to coalesce that data and make it accessible to its suppliers through the Scintilla suite of insights tools, to help improve not only sales performance but also the customer experience.

“The customer journey is really not linear, and with that level of assortment and all the different entry points into our site and our app, we wanted to provide a product that delivers really robust insights around the digital shopping journey,” said Linda Lomelino, Group Director at Walmart Data Ventures in an interview with Retail TouchPoints. That way, “both suppliers and internal users alike can understand how customers are shopping our site and app, as well as [determining] what these pre-purchase behaviors are so that we can make the customer experience even better going forward.”

Now that data is getting an upgrade with a series of enhancements to Scintilla’s Digital Landscapes tool, including the addition of 15 new metrics and a revamped user experience.

“We see the priorities in the [Walmart] business, and we hear from our suppliers all day,” Lomelino said. “As a product person, you want to make sure that you’re delivering exactly the value that you hope to deliver, and a lot of that [right now] is driven by an increased importance of the PDP [product detail page], but also making sure that we can cater to things like viral moments. And the piece that is really critical is being able to see the metric and then pivot strategy quickly.”

That’s exactly what skin and haircare brand E.T. Browne, an early beta tester of the new Digital Landscapes experience, was able to do. The company noticed a massive surge in transactions for its Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Firming Formula lotion, and using insights from Walmart shopping sessions was able to track the upswing back to a viral moment on TikTok.

“Once they understood what was actually happening, they capitalized on that moment and adjusted their forecasting and replenishment strategy to accommodate the increased traffic coming to that product,” said Lomelino. “They took what could have been a pretty large supply chain challenge and used it to really drive sustained growth going forward.”

What’s New in Digital Landscapes

The Digital Landscapes product launched last June and has been available to Charter members of Scintilla — who pay a subscription fee for enhanced data access and tools — for over a year now. E.T. Browne isn’t alone in finding the enhanced tool useful, with Lomelino saying that the response from beta testers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” Now the experience is live for all Charter members.

Enhancements include a complete redesign of the user experience aimed at making the insights “super consumable,” so that both data experts and non-experts can “visualize the insights in a more effective way and understand what a metric means and how it drives the business,” said Lomelino. “You’ll see things like a Sankey chart [a type of flow diagram] that really beautifully describes how traffic is both coming in and exiting our site and our app, to help [suppliers] understand if there are improvements they can make to drive traffic to their product page or drive conversion.”

The update also includes the addition of 15 incremental metrics, including:

Enhanced traffic insights to show where customers started their journey, whether it be from a social media platform, a search engine, coming directly to the Walmart site or app or any other online channel;

Enhanced conversion insights to visualize how many visitors are actually converting;

The new Digital Basket metric, which shows what customers are adding to their cart and what they are they leaving behind, informing abandonment rates and insights to drive conversion;

New metrics around search, including the keywords customers are using to search a particular category or product, so suppliers can better understand what’s trending, but also what the customer’s frame of mind is as they’re searching; and

The new Content Quality Score metric, which helps suppliers understand the quality of their product content. “As you can imagine, this one is very tactical in terms of places where content can be improved — replace the hero image, add better descriptions, etc.,” said Lomelino.

Insights Designed to Drive Business Results

Suppliers can view aggregate metrics on their full Walmart product slate or drill down to the single UPC level. What’s not available are competitors’ metrics, for obvious reasons, but Lomelino said that with the new search insights, brands will be able to learn a lot about category-level behavior.

“These enhancements can really drive improved digital strategies, whether it’s advertising or supply chain or just a better understanding of how customers search for the category,” Lomelino added. “What we’re trying to drive on our side is improved discoverability, improved product conversion, increased purchases and loyalty over time, which fits in really nicely with the larger mission of becoming America’s favorite place to shop.”

Data Helps Refine Advertising Campaigns

Of course, one of the most important ways suppliers will use this data is to inform their advertising strategies, which at Walmart means the Connect retail media business.

“They can allocate their digital spend more effectively, because they understand the digital journey much better with the insights that we provide,” said Lomelino. “Not only that, but then in real time they can optimize campaigns that are in flight by understanding if the campaign is driving the behaviors they expect it to be driving.”

And of course, given that one of Walmart’s biggest strengths is its physical store network, other Scintilla modules offer omnichannel insights into shopper behavior and product sales performance.

“What we have heard from our suppliers very broadly is that they’re triangulating the Digital Landscapes data with all of the other transactional data so they can optimize for broader messaging,” said Lomelino. “So if you see keyword searches that point to something very specific or something viral, suppliers are obviously going to be able to capitalize on some of those signals and then leverage them, whether it’s in-store or online, through Walmart Connect or their traditional marketing assets.",https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_285824992-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 13:16:16.847921

(NYSE: HPSE) is poised for accelerated growth in 2025 as it integrates Juniper Networks and taps rising demand for AI-powered and hybrid cloud solutions. In its recent third quarter earnings, the company reported net revenue of $9.1 billion, up 18% year-on-year, fueled by strong momentum in AI systems and resilient server demand.

According to Visible Alpha consensus estimates, HPE’s net revenue is forecast to climb 15% year-on-year to $34.5 billion in 2025, followed by a further 17% increase to $40.2 billion in 2026. This compares with a modest 3% rise in 2024.

Hewlett Packard’s acquisition of Juniper Networks, completed in July, is a key driver of this growth as the company repositions itself for the AI and hybrid-cloud era. Analysts expect Juniper to contribute $2 billion in sales in 2025, almost tripling to $5.9 billion in 2026.

Hewlett Packard’s hybrid-cloud business is also gaining traction, buoyed by demand for its GreenLake platform, Alletra MP storage systems, and private-cloud AI deployments. The segment expanded 14% in the third quarter and is forecast to grow 7% to $5.8 billion in 2025, a turnaround from a 1% contraction last year.

Headline Takeaway:

(KHC.O) is in a weak technical position with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 2.61, suggesting investors should exercise caution. Meanwhile, fundamentals show strong signs with a score of 8.72.

News Highlights

Here’s what’s shaping the broader market and industry landscape:

DoorDash CEO Tony Xu’s Aggressive Expansion: DoorDash’s recent $3.9 billion acquisition of Deliveroo highlights the competitive nature of food delivery. While this doesn’t directly affect , it underscores shifting consumer behaviors and growing delivery infrastructure that may impact food brands.

India’s Food Labeling Push: The Indian Supreme Court’s directive to finalize food labeling regulations could influence global food safety expectations, potentially affecting how products like KHC are marketed and perceived.

Food Inflation and Tariffs: The ongoing U.S. tariff debates and food inflation trends suggest potential cost pressures for food producers, which could affect KHC's margins and pricing strategy in the long term.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Five institutions have weighed in recently, with a simple average rating of 3.00 and a performance-weighted rating of 2.64. The ratings show mixed consistency — all five analysts issued a Neutral rating, which aligns with the stock's recent price decline of -3.72%.

Internal diagnostic scores (0-10) for key fundamental metrics and values include:

EV/EBIT: 2.62 — Value: -3.53 times

Net Profit Margin (%): 1.00 — Value: -57.56%

Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (YoY %): 8.72 — Value: 12.61%

Net Profit / Total Operating Revenue (%): 1.00 — Value: -57.56%

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities): 8.08 — Value: 1.48

Annualized Return on Total Assets (%): 1.00 — Value: -15.73%

These metrics reflect a mixed fundamental outlook — strong cash flow and revenue performance clash with weak profit margins and return on assets. Investors should closely watch KHC’s ability to manage costs and maintain profitability amid rising food inflation.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows suggest positive movement overall, with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 7.71 and a rating of “good”. Large and extra-large investors are showing positive trends, with inflow ratios of 48.86% and 52.50%, respectively. In contrast, small investors remain bearish, with a 48.37% inflow ratio but a negative trend.

This divergence highlights that institutional money is flowing in while retail traders are cautious. It suggests a potential setup for a long-term trade if fundamentals and sentiment continue to align.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, The Kraft Heinz is in a weak position, with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 2.61 and a clear avoid recommendation. Of the seven indicators analyzed:

Bullish Engulfing (8.08) — A strong bullish candlestick pattern.

MACD Golden Cross (1.00) — A bearish divergence signal.

WR Overbought (1.00) — Suggests overbought conditions, typically a sell signal.

Dividend Record Date (1.00) — History shows a drop of -3.03% after such dates.

MACD Death Cross (2.62) — Suggests a bearish trend.

Recent patterns include a bullish engulfing on 2025-08-29 and a MACD golden cross on 2025-08-27, but these were quickly overwhelmed by bearish signals like the WR overbought and dividend record date.

Overall, the key insights show 6 bearish vs 1 bullish signals. Momentum is weak, and the trend quality is poor — a clear warning sign for technical traders.

Conclusion

While The Kraft Heinz shows strong fundamental performance and positive fund flows, the technical outlook remains bearish with a weak trend and a score of 2.61. Analyst sentiment is neutral, and recent price action supports caution.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363a0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-11 04:00:36.840669

HP has guided for fourth-quarter earnings of 87 to 97 cents a share, in line with consensus estimates, and maintained its annual free cash flow outlook of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2025. Management also expects PC margins to remain within the 5% to 7% range, supported by a shift toward AI-enabled PCs that could represent half of shipments within the next two years.

Evercore ISI left its price target unchanged at $29, reflecting its view that the stock is trading around its price target and that further upside is unlikely in the near term. The firm noted that it sees a host of cross currents that could cloud the path to higher EPS/FCF numbers.

This downgrade reflects Evercore ISI’s cautious stance on HP Inc’s earnings prospects, given the potential impact of tariffs on PC demand and the offsetting weakness in the printing segment.

While the company's leadership touts this as a bold step toward long-term value creation, the market has responded with skepticism, slashing KDP's stock price by over 18% in early trading and erasing $8 billion in market valueKeurig Dr Pepper stock downgraded by HSBC on JDE Peet's acquisition[ 3 ]. This divergence between strategic ambition and investor sentiment raises critical questions: Can KDP's high-leverage bet on the global coffee market deliver sustainable growth, or is the company overreaching in a bid to replicate past successes?

Strategic Moves for Long-Term Growth

KDP's 2025 strategy is anchored in three pillars: innovation, diversification, and scale. The company reported robust Q1 2025 results, with net sales rising 4.8% to $3.6 billion and operating income up 4.7% to $801 millionKeurig Dr Pepper Reports Q1 2025 Results and Reaffirms Guidance for 2025[ 1 ]. These figures underscore KDP's ability to execute disciplined cost management and capitalize on high-growth categories like energy drinks, which now generate over $1 billion in annual salesKeurig Dr Pepper stock downgraded by HSBC on JDE Peet's acquisition[ 3 ]. However, the acquisition of JDE Peet's represents a quantum leap in ambition. By merging KDP's single-serve coffee dominance with JDE's global portfolio (including brands like

and Lavazza), the company aims to create a $16 billion annual revenue stream under a new Global Coffee Co. spin-offKeurig Dr Pepper to acquire JDE Peet's[ 4 ].

The rationale for this move is compelling. Coffee consumption is projected to grow at a 4% CAGR through 2030, driven by premiumization and convenience trendsKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) — $18.4B JDE Peet's Deal[ 2 ]. KDP's CEO, Tim Cofer, has emphasized that the acquisition will unlock $400 million in annual cost synergies and drive EPS accretion, while the separation of the coffee and North American beverage businesses is expected to enhance operational clarityKeurig Dr Pepper to acquire JDE Peet's[ 4 ].

Market Skepticism and Risks

Despite these strategic justifications, investors remain wary. The acquisition's all-cash structure and $18.4 billion price tag have pushed KDP's pro-forma net-debt/EBITDA ratio into the mid-to-high-5x range—a level that raises red flags for leveraged buyout specialists and value investors alikeKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) — $18.4B JDE Peet's Deal[ 2 ].

Reconciling the Two Sides

The key to evaluating KDP's strategy lies in reconciling its long-term vision with short-term execution risks. On one hand, the company's free cash flow generation—$1.2 billion in 2024—provides a buffer for debt servicingKeurig Dr Pepper Reports Q1 2025 Results and Reaffirms Guidance for 2025[ 1 ].

Conclusion

Keurig Dr Pepper's JDE Peet's acquisition is a high-stakes gamble that could redefine its trajectory. While the company's Q1 2025 results and energy drink growth demonstrate operational strength, the market's skepticism is warranted given the leverage and integration risks. For long-term value creation to materialize, KDP must execute flawlessly: delivering synergies, separating the businesses cleanly, and navigating the debt burden without sacrificing innovation.

Dive Brief:

Boston Scientific has agreed to buy Elutia’s two bioenvelope products for $88 million, the companies said Tuesday.

The agreement will give Boston Scientific control of Elupro and Cangaroo, devices designed to promote wound healing to prevent complications after pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.

Elupro and Cangaroo compete with Medtronic’s TYRX. BTIG analysts said in a note to investors that they believe “the Elupro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX.”

Dive Insight:

Elutia received clearance for Elupro in June 2024 and began a full commercial launch at the start of 2025. The device has an extracellular matrix to support wound healing and potentially facilitate re-operative procedures by reducing scar formation and fibrosis. Elupro gradually releases the antibiotics rifampin and minocycline into the surrounding tissue to provide antimicrobial protection after the procedure.

Cangaroo is a first-generation version of the product that lacks antibiotics. Elutia made Elupro the focus of its business after securing clearance to sell the bioenvelope in the U.S., telling investors last month that its success is highly dependent on the commercialization, marketing and sale of the device.

Elutia enlisted Boston Scientific to support the launch. Boston Scientific acts as a sales agent for Elutia, giving the company access to around 900 sales representatives and clinical specialists to complement its own direct sales force. The deal is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter. When that happens, Boston Scientific will take over commercialization of the bioenvelopes.

BTIG analysts said they expect the bioenvelopes to be “a relatively low-effort product sale” for Boston Scientific’s sales reps. The technology can be used with many of Boston Scientific’s implantable devices, the analysts said, and will compete with Medtronic’s TYRX. Medtronic’s device is synthetic and lacks the antibiotic-eluting feature of Elupro. The Elutia devices are biomatrices.

The analysts estimate Elupro and TYRX are competing for a $600 million opportunity in the U.S. cardiac rhythm management sector. Bioenvelope revenue was $3.5 million in the second quarter, the analysts said. Elupro, months into its launch, contributed around two-thirds of the sales.

Boston Scientific is paying a valuation multiple that is roughly in line with the historical average for sales of fast-growing businesses, the analysts said. While the bioenvelopes could be of interest to any company that sells pacemakers or defibrillators, the analysts do not expect additional bidders for the assets because Boston Scientific and Elutia already have a close partnership.

“If CVS bought Bartell and Rite Aid stores, they now are owned by CVS,” said Dima Mazen Qato, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.
That’s what happened recently to Nicole J., a Shoreline resident whose prescription file moved from Rite Aid to CVS.
She believes the pharmacy counted CVS’ acquisition of her file from Rite Aid as a transfer.
CVS acquired 49 Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations in Washington this year, as well as the prescription files from 61 others.","After pharmacy chain Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy in May, CVS bought some of its stores, including the Bartell Drugs locations it owned, and patient records across the Pacific Northwest.

For some, the switch has been messy.

Many insurance plans classify pharmacies as either in-network or out-of-network, the same way they do for doctors and medical facilities.

That means some people who have been picking up their medications from their neighborhood pharmacy for years may no longer be able to do so.

“If CVS bought Bartell and Rite Aid stores, they now are owned by CVS,” said Dima Mazen Qato, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California. “CVS is probably not the preferred pharmacy for the same plans for which Rite Aid and Bartell were preferred or in-network.”

Whether a pharmacy falls within an individual’s insurance network varies by plan. At out-of-network pharmacies, people generally must pay full price for their medication, meaning they could face bills in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

That’s what happened recently to Nicole J., a Shoreline resident whose prescription file moved from Rite Aid to CVS. Nicole asked to be identified by her first name and middle initial to protect her sensitive medical details.

Nicole is on Medicaid, commonly known in Washington as Apple Health, and gets health coverage through the Community Health Plan of Washington. Late last month, she called her new CVS pharmacy for a medication refill. It wasn’t until the prescription was ready for pickup that she learned that CVS isn’t among her plan’s network pharmacies. Out of pocket, she would have had to pay $800 for a month’s supply — a sum she would not have been able to afford.

Her experience is not uncommon. In fact, it happens regularly when pharmacies get bought out or shut down, said Qato.

On social media, Washington residents have complained about long wait times and dead ends when calling to get their records sent from CVS to an in-network pharmacy.

To address potential delays, the state Department of Health in July urged former Rite Aid customers to request refills early so that pharmacies have “ample time” to process them.

CVS acknowledged this week that people might run into issues getting their prescriptions as the pharmacy continues to integrate prescription files from former Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations.

“CVS Pharmacy may be excluded from some payer networks in Washington,” wrote Amy Thibault, executive director of corporate communications. “If that’s the case, the pharmacy team will work with the patient to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy, if requested.”

Delays in prescription refills can be problematic.

“Patients that are dealing with disruptions of pharmacy access — whether it’s a closure or basically not being able to go to a pharmacy because it doesn’t cover the cost of your drugs — they’re less likely to fill or adhere to their medication regimens, which has health implications,” said Qato, who is a senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC.

Nicole’s issue was compounded by difficulties she had in transferring a controlled drug prescription out of CVS.

Her medication is a Schedule III controlled substance. Under federal drug regulations, patients can only transfer prescriptions for such medications between pharmacies once before they need a new prescription.

Nicole said the pharmacy team at CVS refused to transfer her prescription on the basis that she’d already reached her transfer limit. She believes the pharmacy counted CVS’ acquisition of her file from Rite Aid as a transfer. (A CVS spokesperson wrote in an email that acquisitions of patient files do not count as transfers.)

Ultimately, Nicole reached out to her doctor, who wrote her a new prescription. By the time she finally received her medication, almost a week had lapsed.

“It was just really frustrating,” she said. “You don’t want to have interruptions in medication that you’re trying to take regularly.”

CVS’ takeover comes during a prolonged stretch of difficulty for the pharmacy business. Washington is among the states that has been hardest hit by industrywide closures, which make pharmacies more scarce and difficult for residents to access.

The new offering is kicking off during the fourth quarter with a limited beta test in the Americas, but Criteo plans to extend it to any of its more than 200 retail partners globally that show interest, said Sherry Smith, president of retail media at the company.

“Retailers can opt in to receive this demand,” Smith explained. “Every single retailer that we work with, they all want more demand.”

These efforts to funnel new ad dollars into retail media networks through Google could sweeten the pot for Criteo’s retailer clients at a moment when Criteo is facing increasingly fierce competition from a group of smaller competitors vying for market share.

At the same time, the Google and Criteo deal has the potential to further commoditize sponsored product ads, especially if Google extends its retail media demand partnership to Criteo’s competitors, said one retail media source. That could push ad serving prices down across the board, forcing adtech players including Criteo to settle for a smaller share of revenue for each retail media ad sold.

Overall, though, it’s likely beneficial for Criteo as well as the retailers selling ads and the brands buying them, the source said.

“We’re helping advertisers connect with customers at a critical moment in their shopping journey: onsite, through sponsored product ads,” Bill Reardon, general manager of enterprise platform at Google, said in a statement. “Coupled with our existing suite of offsite solutions in Performance Max and Shopping Ads, our goal is to empower advertisers and agencies with a more complete view of their advertising performance, enabling smarter decisions and more effective campaigns.”

By opening up retailer inventory to ad buyers already using Google’s ad management platform, Criteo is effectively lowering the logistical barrier to buying retail ads. Smaller brands and agencies that lack resources might not have the bandwidth to develop relationships with individual retailers—or even with retail media-specific adtech companies like Criteo. Connecting those ad slots to Google makes it possible.

The move builds upon Criteo’s partnership with Mirakl, announced in July, which makes it easier for third-party sellers to buy ads on retail marketplaces.

For retailers aiming to strike a delicate balance between preserving customers’ experience while attracting high-quality ads and cashing in on their high-margin revenue, more demand means more ways to fill ad space left over after whatever gets allotted to major partners during joint-business planning negotiations.

“It is a very big step in unlocking scale for our retail partners to be more efficient—to bring better and more unified measurement,” Smith said. “The intent is to make sure it’s very efficient, it’s very transparent, and that it’s incredibly flexible.”

After the beta test with sponsored product ads, Smith said the goal is to make additional ad formats like onsite display and video available through Google as well.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/large-Criteo-Google_Webart.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-09-10 10:13:04.809916

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., September 10, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In an innovative initiative to improve disaster preparedness and response, Philips, Philips Foundation, and nonprofit MedShare International are collaborating to tackle the healthcare challenges caused by natural disasters.

Unlike traditional reactive disaster response programs, this initiative prioritizes disaster preparedness as a strategy to save lives and create continuity of care. MedShare will have Philips medical equipment and other essential products on hand, ensuring these resources are available for rapid deployment when natural disasters disrupt access to healthcare. Prompted by the critical need highlighted during Hurricane Helene in 2024 [1], this strategic partnership has been designed to supply essential medical equipment and supplies to enable continuity of care to people and communities in need during times of crisis.

""By working hand-in-hand with Philips and the Philips Foundation, we’re not only staging life-saving medical equipment for rapid deployment following disasters, but we’re also reimagining sustainability in emergency response,"" said Stacey Koehnke, CEO and Executive Director of MedShare International. ""Together, we’re building an innovative, resilient, forward-looking system that saves lives today and strengthens response capacity for the challenges of tomorrow.""

The need for a proactive and sustainable approach to disaster response has never been more urgent. Natural disasters are increasingly compromising access to healthcare across the United States, with nearly 400 climate disasters causing over $1 billion in damages each in the past 45 years [2], causing severe damage to so many families and communities.

Philips North America is contributing ultrasound systems capable of cardiac, vascular, obstetric and gynecological imaging. These technologies, to be staged and deployed by MedShare, are supported by field service engineers for installation, maintenance and de-installation to ensure effective deployment in challenging environments. Additionally, the donation of essential mother-and-child care products such as feeding bottles and pacifiers will help to address urgent needs in disaster-affected areas.

""Every human life holds immeasurable value, and that belief drives everything we do,"" said Jeff DiLullo, Chief Region Leader, Philips North America. ""In times of crisis, access to quality healthcare becomes even more critical. Our partnership with MedShare and the Philips Foundation reflects our deep commitment to using innovation and collaboration to protect and uplift vulnerable communities when they need us most.""

Philips Foundation will provide financial aid and strategic guidance, drawing on over a decade of experience in disaster relief. In 2024 alone, the Foundation helped respond to major crises across the world, including the Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Japan and the devastating floods in Brazil, Poland, and Spain, by ensuring the rapid delivery of critical medical equipment and services.

Eddine Sarroukh, Head of the Philips Foundation, stated: ""By combining Philips’ healthcare expertise with MedShare’s extensive network, we are responding to disasters and building a resilient system that supports continuity of care for the most vulnerable communities. It's great that we are teaming up with a like-minded partner to establish a disaster-preparedness model for rapid response and continuity during emergencies, we hope to see scaled.""

This two-year pilot program will serve as a model for future expansion, with a focus on durability and scalability. A key component of the program is the reusability of the donated medical equipment, which will be shipped back to MedShare for reprocessing and redeployment after each emergency. This approach not only maximizes the impact of each device but also sets a new standard, supporting reuse and encouraging environmentally practices in disaster response.

The arrangement also allowed the Japanese pharma giant and Taiwan-based TWi to avoid competition from other generic drug makers even after Takeda’s patent protection for Dexilant had expired, according to the lawsuit.

Like the other retailers, CVS called the deal a “reverse payment"" agreement in which Takeda paid TWi to keep its generic off the market. Such settlements are often referred to as ""pay-for-delay"" agreements.

CVS alleges that the companies’ collusion increased its expenses in purchasing Dexilant for sales to its customers. In the March lawsuit, Walgreens made the same argument, joined by other retailers Kroger, Albertsons and H-E-B.

The CVS lawsuit also names TWi's new parent company, Bora Pharmaceuticals, and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, another Bora subsidiary that merged with and succeeded TWi. Bora acquired TWi in 2022 and Upsher-Smith Laboratories in 2024.

(ARMK) has sparked a critical debate among investors: Is the company's Q3 2023 revenue miss a harbinger of deeper structural issues, or merely a temporary stumble in an otherwise resilient business model? To answer this, one must dissect the interplay between macroeconomic pressures, operational execution, and strategic adaptability. The evidence suggests that while the revenue shortfall in Q3 2023 raised legitimate concerns, the subsequent Q3 2024 results and management's strategic responses indicate a company capable of navigating turbulence and sustaining growth.

The Q3 2023 Revenue Miss: A Symptom of Broader Challenges

In August 2023, Aramark reported quarterly revenue of $4.75 billion, a 15.1% year-over-year increase, yet fell short of market expectationsWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ]. This discrepancy, coupled with a 5.6% stock declineAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ], underscored investor skepticism. The miss was attributed to inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the difficulty of maintaining pricing power in a competitive marketAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. However, earnings per share of $0.36 exceeded forecastsWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ], highlighting the company's ability to manage costs and protect margins.

Management at the time emphasized resilience, noting that organic revenue growth of over 14% was driven by its Global Food & Support Services and Uniform Services segmentsAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. The latter, in particular, showed promise, with a planned spin-off by year-end signaling a strategic pivot to focus on core competenciesAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. Yet, the revenue shortfall raised questions about the sustainability of growth in a macroeconomic environment marked by rising tariffs and inflationAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ].

Q3 2024: A Turnaround Driven by Strategic Execution

By Q3 2024, Aramark had not only recovered but exceeded expectations. The company reported record revenue of $4.4 billion, with organic growth of 11% year-over-year across all business lines and geographiesWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ]. This performance was underpinned by three key factors:

Cost Management and Supply Chain Efficiency: Aramark's global supply chain team optimized spend, contributing to a 22% year-over-year increase in operating incomeARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ]. The company also anticipates surpassing $20 billion in global supply chain and GPO network spend by fiscal year-endARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ], a testament to its ability to scale efficiencies.

New Client Acquisition: A robust sales pipeline and strategic client wins, particularly in corporate catering and institutional food services, drove volume growthARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ].

Innovation and Partnerships: The collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Daniel Boulud to enhance culinary offerings exemplifies Aramark's focus on differentiationAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ]. This move targets high-margin segments like special events and premium corporate catering, aligning with broader trends in experiential dining.

Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds: Pricing and Domestic Sourcing

Despite these successes, macroeconomic challenges persist. Inflation and potential tariffs remain risks, yet management has adopted a proactive stance. By leveraging pricing strategies and increasing domestic sourcingAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ], Aramark aims to mitigate input cost volatility. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, where companies are reconfiguring supply chains to reduce reliance on globalized networks.

The Uniform Services spin-off, now largely completed, further insulates the core business from cyclical fluctuations in uniform demandAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. This structural change enhances focus on higher-growth areas, such as food services, which are less susceptible to macroeconomic shocks.

Assessing Sustainability: A Balancing Act

The sustainability of Aramark's growth hinges on its ability to maintain operational discipline while scaling innovation. The Q3 2024 results demonstrate that the company can execute under pressure, but long-term success will depend on:

- Continued Cost Optimization: Sustaining supply chain efficiencies in a volatile environment.

- Strategic Partnerships: Leveraging collaborations like the one with Boulud to capture premium pricing.

- Geographic Diversification: The international segment's 16% organic growth in Q3 2023ARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ] suggests that expanding into emerging markets could buffer against U.S.-centric risks.

Conclusion: A Transient Setback, Not a Structural Crisis

Aramark's Q3 2023 revenue miss was a transient setback, not a sign of systemic weakness. The company's subsequent performance, coupled with strategic initiatives to address macroeconomic risks, reinforces its capacity to sustain growth. While challenges remain, the combination of operational agility, innovation, and disciplined cost management positions Aramark to thrive in a complex environment. For investors, the key takeaway is that the revenue miss was a symptom of broader economic turbulence, not a flaw in the business model itself.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 13:14:37.918201

The project named U DESERVE 5G will demonstrate the feasibility of direct communications between satellites and mobile devices or fixed terminals (5G direct to device, or D2D). A demonstrator satellite will be placed in low-Earth orbit to test interoperability between terrestrial and nonterrestrial 5G networks. The project will use a set of scenarios to evaluate how smoothly devices can switch between satellite and terrestrial 5G coverage, which is a crucial step toward truly global, seamless and uninterrupted connectivity.

At a time when anytime, anywhere connectivity has become a strategic priority — both to meet market demand and ensure infrastructure resilience in crisis situations — satellite technology is emerging as a crucial and complementary solution alongside terrestrial networks.

At the heart of the project is an innovative 5G satellite payload with an active antenna. It will enable voice calls and data transmission directly between the satellite and a test mobile device, without routing via a ground station. The demonstrator will include all components of the chain: test satellite, payload, NTN ground segment and test mobile devices. It will be compatible with Release 17 of the 3GPP 5G standard and will provide an end-to-end test platform to evaluate the performance of the 5G NTN/TN system and trial use cases, especially involving the Internet of Things (IoT).

Thales, which will assess the feasibility of a 5G D2D terminal with a directional antenna operating in the future C band.

Orange, which will contribute its operator expertise and host the demonstration at its Bercenay facility in France.

SES, in charge of studying the implementation of D2D services.

Qualcomm, which will supply a 5G NTN-compatible test mobile terminal.

Loft Orbital, responsible for the platform, AIT (assembly, integration, testing), launch reservation and satellite operations for the demonstration phase.

“This new 5G D2D project paves the way for Thales Alenia Space to provide high-speed coverage in areas not served by terrestrial networks, as well as emergency or continuity services in crisis situations,” said Stéphane Anjuère, 5G Venture Leader for Thales Alenia Space. “By leveraging its expertise in geostationary telecommunications and medium- and low-Earth orbit constellations, our company has played a key role in the standardisation of 5G by satellite and is ideally positioned to support future large-scale 5G D2D projects.”

“This pioneering 5G-by-satellite project represents a major breakthrough for Thales and the telecommunications industry,” said Alexandre Bottero, VP Networks and Infrastructure Systems for Thales. “By developing 5G NTN D2D modem solutions enabling high-speed connectivity, even in the most remote areas, we’re laying the groundwork for the future of global communications and stepping up our commitment to a more connected and resilient world.”

“This project perfectly emphasises Capgemini’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of connectivity. Thanks to our unique expertise in integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, in addition to our mastery of radio access solutions and 4G/5G core networks, Capgemini is playing a key role in demonstrating 5G via satellite,” added Angélique Lallouet, Executive Director of Capgemini Engineering in France. “We are particularly proud to be contributing to this strategic initiative alongside Thales Alenia Space, Thales, and all of our partners, and to be collaborating once again with CNES to advance French and European technological sovereignty.”",https://www.advanced-television.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/France-e1632927980564.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:11:23.932922

“The surge of On-Demand technologies – such as Public Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI – has reshaped how leading businesses operate.
These include: Soaring costs and complexity: 82% of executives report significant increases in cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI costs.","As digital transformation accelerates across industries, organizations are embracing On-Demand technologies — such as public cloud, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Generative AI (Gen AI) — to scale innovation, improve agility, and support competitiveness. But while the benefits are clear, a new global study from the Capgemini Research Institute published today, ‘The On-Demand tech paradox: balancing speed and spend’, reveals that rising costs, complexity, and governance gaps are putting returns at risk. With growing demand for digital infrastructure, organizations are struggling to contain technology costs due to lack of cost visibility, underutilized resources, as well as a legacy mindset.

Organizations are pivoting from capital-intensive IT investments to flexible, consumption-based models and On-Demand technologies. According to the report, IT and technology spend is projected to rise and the share of On-Demand tech in IT budgets is expected to grow from 29% to 41% over the next year. The majority (77%) of executives view cloud scalability and performance as critical to business growth and differentiation, as it allows their organizations to scale innovation, accelerate time-to-market and stay competitive. Despite these benefits, many organizations are struggling to harness these On-Demand technologies while maintaining costs.

“The surge of On-Demand technologies – such as Public Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI – has reshaped how leading businesses operate. These tools offer unparalleled convenience, but they come with a financial implication,” said Karine Brunet, CEO of Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini and member of the Group Executive Committee. “While On-Demand technology expenses are projected to double over the next three to four years, organizations must find a way to gain transparency and control over costs while elevating value. Those that align their cloud strategy with their overall business goals are well positioned to harness this opportunity. By designing scalable, modular, cloud-native and frugal architecture, they are set-up to drive sustainable value through smarter FinOps, integrated governance, and AI-driven automation.”

On-Demand technologies are driving tech and IT spending, but not without challenges

While the more advanced adopters of On-Demand tech are already reaping rewards — from cost savings and faster product innovation to improved service quality and operational productivity, less mature adopters are finding that the road ahead is not without its challenges. These include:

Soaring costs and complexity: 82% of executives report significant increases in cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI costs. Inflation, AI adoption, and digital infrastructure demands are key drivers.

Budget overruns: 76% of organizations exceeded their public cloud budgets (by an average of 10%), while 68% overspent on Gen AI and 52% on SaaS. Underutilized resources and decentralized procurement are major culprits.

Shadow IT and security risks: Business units now drive 59% of Gen AI and 48% of SaaS spending. 12% of all SaaS spending is unmanaged. Nearly all executives (98%) admit to bypassing IT for tech purchases, creating inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities.

Limited ROI realization: Despite heavy investments, only 29% achieved expected SaaS cost savings, 33% saw desired cloud service quality, and 38% realized faster innovation with Gen AI.

FinOps, a critical yet underdeveloped discipline to optimize costs and elevate On-Demand tech value

According to the survey, 60% of organizations use cloud cost management tools, but only 37% evaluate their effectiveness or act on insights. While three quarters of the organizations surveyed (76%) have or plan to establish FinOps teams, most remain narrowly focused and operational in nature. Only 2% who have a dedicated FinOps function cover cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI holistically, and just 42% influence business decisions.

In addition, more than half (53%) of the organizations agree that suboptimal On-Demand tech usage leads to excessive energy consumption and increased carbon emissions. Despite this, only 36% of organizations have a strategy for integrating sustainability into FinOps. Integrating practices such as developing energy-efficient architectures, optimizing computing and storage, switching off idle resources and scheduling workloads can reduce costs as well as carbon.

Report Methodology

The Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 1,000 executives from global organizations with annual revenue of at least $1 billion who are consuming On-Demand technologies (Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI on Cloud) in 12 sectors and 14 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The global survey was carried out in May 2025. To supplement the findings, Capgemini also conducted in-depth discussions with 10 executives from global organizations.

""If I can use big words, it's a facile and fallacious logic,"" the Barclays chief told CNBC's Sarah Eisen in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday.
Pressed on the direct consequences of an increased levy, the Barclays chief laid out a stark scenario.
""We would have to find ways to get greater productivity, pull back on hiring, and actually issue less credit into the U.K. economy,"" he said.
As an alternative to raising taxes on banks, Venkatakrishnan urged the government to focus its spending on long-term investments designed to reverse a national decline in productivity.","Barclays Chief Executive C.S. Venkatakrishnan criticized a proposal to raise taxes on British banks, warning the ""facile and fallacious logic"" behind such a move would compel the lender to cut back on hiring and reduce lending to the British economy. Venkatakrishnan said that further burdening a sector already facing one of the highest tax rates globally is not a viable solution to the U.K.'s difficult fiscal situation. ""If I can use big words, it's a facile and fallacious logic,"" the Barclays chief told CNBC's Sarah Eisen in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday. ""Take the banking sector [in the U.K.], which is already paying a tax rate of 48%, higher than almost any other banking sector."" Contrasting the figure with rates in other major financial hubs, Venkatakrishnan continued, ""New York is like 26%, and even the highest in Europe is like 39%, so adding to that is not a path towards economic growth."" In the U.K., banks pay a 3% surcharge on the standard corporate tax rate, which stands at 25%. The Barclays chief executive, however, was referring to a much broader measure known as the ""total tax rate,"" which aims to capture the entire tax burden that falls on a company as a direct cost, representing a percentage of its commercial profits. The figures were compiled by the consultancy PwC for the trade lobby UK Finance. The U.K. government is reportedly considering raising the bank surcharge by up to 2% in November to help offset part of an estimated £20 billion deficit in its annual budget. London finds itself needing to raise taxes or cut spending drastically after a rise in inflation expectations drove up U.K. bond yields. The U.K. government has also had to reverse its policy on cuts to welfare after political backlash. Robert Woods, chief U.K. economist at Panthen Macroeconomics, said ""we estimate that in its forthcoming Budget forecast, the OBR will raise forecast debt-interest costs at the five-year forecast horizon by only [£3 billion]"" in a note to clients on September 8. The U.K. Treasury did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Pressed on the direct consequences of an increased levy, the Barclays chief laid out a stark scenario. ""We would have to find ways to get greater productivity, pull back on hiring, and actually issue less credit into the U.K. economy,"" he said. The reason, he explained, is that the bank ""wouldn't have as much capital to reinvest back into the system."" The warning carries significant weight, as Venkatakrishnan noted that the financial services industry accounts for 10% of the U.K. economy and serves as a major source of export earnings for the country. London-listed Barclays shares have risen 40% in 2025, and the lender reported a near-record net profit of about £6 billion ($8.1 billion) in the latest 12-month period ending June 2025, according to FactSet. Barclays also trades in New York. BARC-GB YTD line A 'pro-business government' Despite his critique of the specific tax proposal, Venkatakrishnan also expressed broad confidence in the current government's handling of the economy. He acknowledged that officials have to make difficult choices regarding taxation and spending, but described the administration as supportive of companies. ""It is a pro-business government. It is absolutely pro-business. I have felt it since the day they walked in,"" he said, adding that the government understands the importance of the financial sector to the nation's economy. As an alternative to raising taxes on banks, Venkatakrishnan urged the government to focus its spending on long-term investments designed to reverse a national decline in productivity. ""That spending has to be investment: investment in housing, investment in infrastructure, investment in long-term productivity,"" he said.

In the Americas, including the US, its second biggest market, Inditex saw sales fall 3.8 in the first half, citing a 'complex' market.

The company's investor relations director, Gorka Garcia-Tapia, told analysts the 'complex' comment referred to US tariffs and trade wars, as well as foreign exchange swings.

Donald Trump has implemented a 15 per cent levy on goods imported from the EU.

Inditex, which is the world's largest fashion retailer, said second quarter sales rose to €10.08billion in the three months to the end of July.

While an improvement on the previous quarter, analysts had been expecting growth of around 3.4 per cent.

But Inditex said sales accelerated in recent weeks after the successful launch of its latest autumn and winter clothing lines. The business said its new collections had been 'very well received' by shoppers.

The group reported a 9 per cent rise in sales across its stores and online between 1 August and 7 September

The Spanish retail firm, which also owns the Pull & Bear and Bershka brands, revealed total sales grew by 1.6 per cent to £15.9billion in the first half, with sales rising 5.1 per cent after adjusting for currency rates.

Sales for the group’s Zara business grew slightly to £11.4billion, but represented a slowdown in growth amid pressure on consumer finances.

Oscar García Maceiras, chief executive of Inditex, said: 'We have again achieved a solid performance in this first half of 2025, with satisfactory sales in a complex market environment and keeping strong levels of profitability.

'The efficient execution accomplished by our teams demonstrates the strength of Inditex’s business model.'

Separately on Wednesday Primark owner Associated British Foods said the retail chain saw trading improve in recent months despite 'consumer caution', as its UK and stores recovered ground.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Inditex was 'navigating a challenging path.'

He added: 'Its products are more expensive [than Primark's], which means the goods must sparkle to convince cautious shoppers to part with their cash.

'The difference between Inditex and Primark is that the former is more upbeat about current trading, explaining why its shares jumped on its update.

'Both Inditex and Primark have US operations and they’re having to contend with tariffs and unfavourable foreign exchange rates.

'Life is never easy as a retailer as there are so many things out of their control – be it the wrong type of weather, economic weakness or taxes. It currently feels like a perfect storm for the retail sector and management must be adept at spinning multiple plates.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/10/10/102001789-0-image-m-16_1757498338408.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 10:12:44.449785

The entities said their signing of what is claimed to be a UK-first Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) agreement will streamline collaboration on ‘mutually beneficial’ research and innovation projects across cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgery, and diabetes.

The latest agreement builds on an existing partnership that has resulted in improved care and clinical outcomes for patients over the past decade through piloting medtech solutions in MFT-operated hospitals, according to a joint statement by Medtronic and the MFT. These include the remote monitoring pathway TriageHP Plus, which has reduced the number of hospitalisations due to heart failure.

In October 2024, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended the NHS use the pathway for heart failure patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices.

Medtronic UK and Ireland senior director Dr Matthew Williams-Gray commented: “By co-developing novel solutions in cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgery, and diabetes, we aim to accelerate the transformation of healthcare and improve patient outcomes.”

A key role for MFT under the RDI will be in facilitating the use of anonymised clinical data for public and private benefit through its Clinical Data Science Unit.

The pair-up will also involve the use of Medtronic’s product portfolio to increase remote patient monitoring and community care-based provisions on the NHS. MFT’s hosted infrastructure, including the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) HealthTech Research Centre (HRC) in Emergency and Acute Care, will support this aspect of the initiative.

More broadly, the RDI agreement resonates with technological strategies outlined under the UK Labour Government’s 10-year plan for the NHS, which outlines shifts from hospital to more community-centred care and the transition from an analogue to a more digital health service.

To support these ambitions, the government announced a £29bn ($39.1bn) funding boost to the NHS in June, reflecting a 3% annual rise on current levels over the next three years to reach £226bn by 2029.

Dr Katherine Boylan, deputy managing director of research and innovation at MFT, commented: “This collaboration provides a huge opportunity to pioneer breakthroughs in healthcare and accelerate our joint projects to design and deliver innovative research that will really make a difference in the NHS.”",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/09/shutterstock_2472349537.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:36.294035

Speaking at a Barclays conference earlier this week, CS Venkatakrishnan said any more taxation on banks would harm the government’s aims of growing the economy, as he recommitted to the bank’s investment in its UK operations.

“Additional bank taxes in the UK . . . are not a good idea in any way, shape, or form, and if I can be clear . . . that is not a path to higher growth in the UK and most economists would agree,” Venkatakrishnan said.

UK banks’ share prices dived last week after the Institute for Public Policy Research — a think-tank — recommended various taxes on lenders’ profits as a way to fill the current government budget deficit. NatWest, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group all saw their shares drop between 2 per cent and 5 per cent on the fears that a levy might be introduced, focusing on the profits gained from deposits held at the Bank of England as a result of quantitative easing.

The think-tank predicted this could prevent between £35bn and £40bn of taxpayer losses over the course of this parliament, and boost the government’s fiscal headroom by between £5bn and £7bn.

Banks currently pay around 45 per cent in tax in the UK — among the highest across global financial centres — which includes 25 per cent in corporation tax (a tax on profits), the banking surcharge, which is 3 per cent of profits, and the bank levy which is 0.1 per cent of UK balance sheets. Increasing these tax rates, or adding further taxes, could dent the attractiveness of the UK for investment.

However, analysts dismissed the market’s reaction to the proposed levy, highlighting it would be antithetical to the government’s pro-growth aims, comments echoed by Venkatakrishnan this week.

In his comments to the conference earlier this week, Venkatakrishnan said Barclays remained committed to the UK, highlighting its target to deploy £30bn of risk-weighted assets in the UK by 2026.

“[W]e are extremely confident in the UK we are committed to that extra £30bn . . . and we expect that as our home market to be a growing central part of the bank.”

He expressed support in the current government, despite concerns over its ability to tackle low growth, and dismissed concerns over rising gilt yields, saying that UK yields — which reached their highest level since 1998 last week — have moved with global yields, which is largely technical and is not a fundamental issue.

“The fundamental issue in the UK at the moment is growth, [and] the government has this absolutely front of mind and I am confident that they are up to the challenge,” he said.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/b7e13e93-c06a-43cf-9f37-89fa5b8527a9.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:11:13.083282

Most automotive organizations anticipate that software will be the single biggest source of competitive advantage over the next five years, but so far only a few have fully scaled their efforts

The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation as software becomes increasingly central to its business strategy and operations. According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, 'The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles', nearly all automotive organizations (92%) now anticipate that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM)[1] services. Over eight in ten believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition.

According to the report, while ambitions are strong, less than half of automotive organizations have scaled their SDM initiatives in 2025: 34% have partially scaled at least one SDM use case, and just 14% have achieved full-scale deployment.

While decoupling hardware and software has emerged as crucial to enable faster innovation, drive improved scalability, and unlock new revenue streams, the survey shows that only one in ten original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has made progress in this journey, with just over a quarter actively piloting new approaches.

'For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,' said Laurence Noel, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini. 'Forward-looking automotive organizations are already treating software as their core product and leveraging key partnerships to expand their ecosystem. While the ambition is high, it requires a complete organizational overhaul. Those that align their talent, platforms, and partnerships, while fostering trust and delivering an elevated customer experience, will stay ahead of the curve.'

Strategic partnerships and ecosystem collaboration are accelerating the shift to SDM

According to the report, automotive organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with big tech and hyperscalers for critical software, cloud, and data capabilities. While only a few have established joint ventures so far, a third plan to do so within three years. Up to 84% are exploring new supplier markets to build resilience, and nearly 70% are doubling down on in-house development of key components to retain control over brand-defining technologies. Organizations are also restructuring their supply chains for geopolitical resilience, by exploring new sourcing markets including India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe.

Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs. According to the report, their share of OEMs' total revenue is projected to double, contributing to over 50% by 2035.

AI is driving a new era of innovation in the auto industry

The report highlights that a vast majority (85%) agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, embedded directly into software features and functions, from improving in-vehicle experiences to powering advanced safety features and cybersecurity.

Over three-quarters (77%) see AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services as a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, boosting productivity and efficiency, and enhancing product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation. Notably, most surveyed organizations view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization's software-driven strategy.

Software-driven mobility demands an organizational overhaul to reap its full potential

According to the survey, most organizations (86%) believe SDM strategy demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. In addition to structural changes, organizations face a range of challenges in software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition. Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform[2] as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.

Report Methodology

In June 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 600 executives from 200 long-established automotive organizations, with no more than four respondents from each organization. These executives represented organizations across four segments: OEMs, suppliers, mobility service providers, and digital natives from countries across North America, Europe, and APAC. The surveys were complemented by interviews with more than fifteen industry experts.

The industrial sector is a major contributor to this environmental challenge.

According to Capgemini, the sector is responsible for more than 35% of greenhouse gas emissions, with Scope 3 emissions accounting for 70% of this figure.

Capgemini’s 'Building Sustainable Value Chains' report states that without intervention, rising emissions could lead to a global temperature increase of 4.1–4.8°C by 2100, which far surpasses the 1.5–2°C target set by the Paris Agreement.

However, this push for sustainable transformation also offers a considerable opportunity for businesses to improve cost efficiency, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

The complexities of corporate decarbonisation

While sustainability is a priority for many corporations, executing a successful strategy remains a substantial challenge.

Half of all companies acknowledge they are not on schedule with their Scope 3 decarbonisation targets and 67% report having low confidence in their ability to create and implement mature roadmaps for change.

Several barriers contribute to this difficulty, including:

difficulty in making a strong business case for long-term sustainability investments.

complexity in tracking and accurately reporting carbon emissions.

obstacles in decarbonising supply chains.

limited scalability of low-carbon technologies.

The challenge is further complicated by variations between sectors. In industries such as cement, steel and mining, Scope 1 emissions are the primary concern.

In contrast, for sectors like chemicals, electronics and food, the main issue lies with Scope 3 emissions, necessitating deep collaboration with suppliers, manufacturers and consumer brands.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” explain Cyril Garcia, Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability at Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès, Global Head of Intelligent Industry at Capgemini Invent, in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain redesign.”

The business case for sustainability

Despite these obstacles, there is strong evidence supporting the advantages of developing sustainable value chains.

Sustainable practices can directly improve cost efficiency by lowering energy consumption, reducing carbon taxes and optimising operational processes.

For instance, a packaging redesign guided by a life-cycle assessment cut a product's carbon footprint from 10 to three kgCO₂e while also reducing costs.

In another case, an automotive project successfully lowered Scope 1 emissions by 27% and Scope 2 emissions by 13% across 17 different sites.

Circular business models have also shown impressive results, with the water and automotive sectors demonstrating material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions of 70%.

Furthermore, the use of digital twins and AI models enabled one heavy industry client to decrease its kiln energy consumption by 15% and shorten development cycles by 70%.

A framework for successful transformation

Capgemini has outlined three core pillars that underpin a successful value chain transformation.

The first is sustainable product design, which involves integrating eco-friendly materials, energy efficiency and circularity from the initial design phase to lower costs, extend product life and enhance competitiveness.

The second pillar, sustainable manufacturing, focuses on moving to low-carbon energy sources, improving water and waste efficiency and adopting circular production models to reduce both emissions and operational expenses.

The final pillar, sustainable supply chains, involves responsible sourcing, logistics optimisation and ESG transparency to minimise reliance on vulnerable resources and bolster resilience against market volatility.

Data, digitalisation and AI are crucial in expediting this sustainable transformation.

These technologies facilitate predictive modelling, improved decision-making and traceability throughout the value chain.

For example, one manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references used an automated product carbon footprint system to develop a thorough decarbonisation roadmap. “Digital transformation and AI are a formidable opportunity to get faster and improve decision-making throughout this transformation as they help achieve better designs, more productive assets and more flexible supply chains,” say Cyril and Charlotte in the report.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/390a472582df92980380e0c739298e65:d348d3787c6624b7085c581ca8de0bac/cap-energy.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 07:09:39.551698

Every year, nearly 1.5 million hernia repair surgeries are performed in the United States, making hernia repair one of the most common surgeries for adult men and women. Hernia repair addresses conditions where part of the intestine bulges through weakened abdominal muscles. Left untreated, hernias can lead to pain, digestive troubles, swelling, or infection. Surgical repair is currently the leading effective treatment, with innovation in minimally invasive approaches including mesh technology helping advance patient care.

In the Enable Hernia Repair clinical study, the mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 hours for inguinal patients and 6.7 hours for ventral.

“We’re grateful for the opportunity to partner with clinical teams to treat this common and often painful condition for millions of patients around the world,” said Rajit Kamal, vice president and general manager of Robotic Surgical Technologies within the Surgical business of Medtronic. “Adding a digitally-powered robotic-assisted surgery system to our laparoscopic and open surgery solutions for hernia repair gives surgeons more choice and patients greater access to the care they need — and we believe that’s a win for everyone.”

The study builds on the growing body of evidence for Hugo including the Expand URO U.S. clinical study, which also met safety and effectiveness endpoints, and nearly 300 independent publications by surgeons using the Hugo RAS system.

Born out of Medtronic’s 75-year commitment to expanding access to minimally invasive surgical options worldwide in partnership with clinicians, the Hugo RAS system is clinically used in 30+ countries on five continents.

In the U.S., the company’s submission for a urology indication is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, with a U.S. urology indication expected later in the company’s current fiscal year, followed by planned indication expansions into hernia repair and gynecology.

The Medtronic Hugo RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability. In the EU, the Hugo RAS system is CE marked. In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.",https://med-techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Medtronic.png,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:40.498850

How is Bharti AXA Life using digital marketing, social media, or influencer-led campaigns to educate and build trust with first-time insurance buyers?","Winning the trust of first-time insurance buyers in India is a challenge that goes far beyond offering a competitive premium. Today’s early-career professionals expect simplicity, speed, and transparency at every step from choosing a plan to renewing a policy or filing a claim. They are digital-first, budget-conscious, and accustomed to the seamless experiences offered by fintech apps and e-commerce platforms.

Nitin Mehta, Chief Distribution Officer – Partnership Distribution at Bharti AXA Life Insurance, shares how the company is reimagining insurance for this new generation. Through strategic partnerships with fintech players and online aggregators, a robust digital servicing platform, and AI-driven underwriting, Bharti AXA Life is making insurance products more accessible and affordable than ever. Add to this modular plan designs, instant policy loans, and influencer-led awareness campaigns, and it’s clear that the company’s approach is as much about building trust as it is about selling policies.

Digital platforms have significantly transformed how young families discover and purchase insurance. How has Bharti AXA Life Insurance leveraged mobile apps and online aggregators to enhance accessibility and engagement for early-career professionals?

We at Bharti AXA Life have embraced digital platforms to make insurance more accessible for early-career professionals and everyone. We have strategically leveraged mobile apps and online aggregators to enhance accessibility and engagement for this cohort by focusing on convenience, transparency, and a user-centric experience. We partnered with aggregators like Policy Bazaar fintechs like Airtel Payment Bank and also consumer digital platforms like Tata Digital to offer our products and services on their platforms extending our reach. We also have our own customer digital platform that gives the customer a 360-degree view of their portfolio with us along with 18 digital servicing options. Features like in-app notifications and alerts prevent policyholders from missing renewal dates, reminding them of fund values in their ULIP policies etc.

Micro-insurance products are gaining traction among price-sensitive segments. How is technology helping Bharti AXA Life design and deliver affordable, personalised plans that align with the needs of young professionals just starting their financial journeys?

Technology enables insurers to offer modular and “pick-and-choose” insurance products. Instead of a rigid, one-size-fits-all policy, young professionals can select specific riders and benefits that align with their current needs and financial constraints. For example, they can start with a basic term life plan and add riders for critical illness or disability as their income and responsibilities grow. Our product offerings enable such flexible choices for customers and our technology platforms enable the customer to add such riders at any point in their policy term digitally as per their need and convenience.

Could you share how Bharti AXA Life is utilising AI to assess risk more accurately and reduce costs, thereby making insurance more attractive to budget-conscious customers?

We use AI enabled self-learning models to assess risk at the time of on-boarding which curates customer provided data as well as data from other sources like IIB, Crisil and many more. This helps us detect anomalies, fraud, early claim and/or renewal propensity enabling us to take more informed and efficient underwriting decisions. On-boarding reduced risky business reduces claim rate as well as early claims thereby improving reserve ratios and enabling us to do competitive pricing. This helps in offering attractive premium rates to today’s budget conscious customers.

How is Bharti AXA Life using digital marketing, social media, or influencer-led campaigns to educate and build trust with first-time insurance buyers?

We are leveraging social media and PR in building awareness and establishing the importance of life insurance. In the past, we have leveraged a key influencer and done a series of videos which provides step-by-step guidance on why one should consider investing in life insurance and demystifying the myths around it

With the growth of fintech and insurtech ecosystems, how is Bharti AXA collaborating with digital payment platforms or fintech players to offer flexible, seamless insurance experiences tailored to the financial behavior of young Indian families?

We have partnered with multiple insurtech and fintech firms to offer very unique products and services offerings. We work with digital marketplaces like policy bazaar, fintech platforms like Airtel Payments Bank to offer our products and services through their platforms. We are also working with other digital platforms like Tata Digital to offer our products to all customers on their platform. Apart from this we continue to work on providing unique offerings on our own mobile platform – DigiServe. One of the most recent offerings rolled out on this platform is disbursal of loan against policy to customer’s bank account in less than 60 seconds for our policy holders with ZERO documentation.

In what ways has Bharti AXA Life responded to the post-COVID shift in customer expectations, especially in terms of digital onboarding, quick policy issuance, and claims processing?

COVID has been a great catalyst for our digital transformation. Currently our digital presence and service capabilities have gone far beyond fulfilling just customer expectations. We have achieved 100% digital on-boarding in FY-24 with our straight through processing clocking ~60%. We deliver 93% of our customer servicing digitally and maintain a stellar claim settlement ratio of 99.18% with 48 hours fund value guarantee and one day settlement for eligible claims through our Claim Express Service. However, our digital footprint extends further and impacts other stakeholders like we are doing 100% digital seller on-boarding, faster digital weekly commission payout, on-boarding new partners in two weeks.

Looking ahead, what role do you see emerging technologies like blockchain or embedded insurance playing in further improving access and affordability for the next generation of insurance buyers in India?

Technologies like blockchain and embedded insurance are poised to play a transformative role in making insurance more accessible and affordable for India’s next generation of buyers. Blockchain brings in transparency that can help reduce fraudulent claims, which will contribute to better pricing thereby bringing down the premiums. It can gain greater confidence in the claims process, a significant concern for young consumers who distrust traditional financial institutions. However, the application has yet to pick up speed in India.

Embedded Insurance by offering a small, contextual policy at the moment of truth is a game-changer for a generation that values convenience and is often underinsured. This model removes the traditional need for a separate insurance agent or a lengthy application process. The insurance purchase is a frictionless, opt-in option that takes seconds, aligning perfectly with the digital-first habits of young buyers. It has the potential to really derive the value of insurance in India reaching the vast, underserved population in India’s tier-2 and tier-3 cities. By partnering with popular local platforms, from fintech apps to e-commerce sites, insurers can reach a wider audience and introduce them to the concept of insurance in a familiar and trusted environment.",,N,,2025-09-10 09:10:59.925807

-- ArcelorMittalâs Phase II Expansion Marks a New Chapter

Liberia witnessed a milestone as President Joseph Nyuma Boakai joined ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal to inaugurate West Africaâs largest and most technologically advanced iron ore concentrator in Tokadeh, Nimba County.

The $1.8 billion project represents the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal Liberiaâs Phase II expansion, which quadruples annual production capacity from 5 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes. The state-of-the-art concentrator upgrades lower-grade ore into premium magnetite concentrate, boosting both output and efficiency.

âThis achievement is a testament to our long-term commitment to Liberia,â said Mr. Mittal during the ceremony. âBy increasing production fourfold, we reaffirm our belief in Liberiaâs growth, its people, and its promise.â

The expansion includes the rehabilitation of the 243-kilometer railway linking Tokadeh to the Port of Buchanan and the construction of a deep-water pier equipped with advanced ore-handling systems. These upgrades modernize Liberiaâs logistics backbone, opening new opportunities for both domestic and regional trade.

President Boakai highlighted the national impact: âThis expansion tells the world that Liberia is ready for investment, ready for jobs, ready for prosperity. Thousands of jobs have been created, and more than 1,000 permanent positions are emerging. This project proves that our economy is rising, and our people are rising with it.â

ArcelorMittal Liberia employs nearly 9,000 people, 81 percent of whom are Liberians. With Phase II operations, that figure is expected to grow further. The companyâs Advanced Vocational Training Center in Yekepa continues to produce skilled technicians and mining professionals, equipping young Liberians with the expertise needed for leadership roles in the sector.

Beyond mining operations, ArcelorMittal Liberia contributes to education, healthcare, and small-business development in host communities across Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties. Renovated schools, upgraded clinics, and support for entrepreneurs form part of a long-term strategy to ensure that growth reaches everyday citizens.

âInvesting in infrastructure and communities is just as important as our mining operations,â noted the companyâs CEO. âOur mission is to help build a stronger Liberia, creating jobs, improving public services, and leaving a legacy of sustainable growth for generations to come.â

ArcelorMittal Liberia received the award for Best Mining Company in Liberia of 2025 from Best of Best Review. The recognition highlights the companyâs leadership, sustainability efforts, and transformative role in national development.

Elias Shoniyin, CEO of ADMA, emphasized the significance of this recognition: âThe award reflects ArcelorMittal Liberiaâs contribution to job creation, infrastructure development, and economic recovery. It acknowledges the companyâs role in shaping Liberia into a competitive player in the global mining industry.â

Looking ahead, ArcelorMittal is exploring options to expand annual capacity to 30 million tonnes and develop Direct Reduction Iron (DRI)-grade concentrate, a critical input for low-carbon steelmaking. This aligns Liberia with global decarbonization efforts, positioning the country as a future supplier for green steel production.

The concentratorâs commissioning has not only reinforced Liberiaâs place in global mining but also marked a turning point in the countryâs post-conflict recovery. With billions in investment, thousands of jobs, and modernized infrastructure, Liberia is moving from being resource-rich to opportunity-rich.

ArcelorMittal Liberia, a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, the worldâs leading steel and mining company, has operated in Liberia since 2006. As the nationâs largest private-sector employer and a leading taxpayer, the company is committed to responsible mining, workforce development, and sustainable community investment.

L'Oréal, alineado con Europa Con más de 4.000 investigadores y 6.400 expertos tecnológicos y digitales en el mundo, L’Oréal Groupe quiere situarse a la vanguardia de la sostenibilidad en la industria.","L’Oréal Groupe encara la recta final de su convocatoria para captar proyectos con su Aceleradora de Innovación Sostenible. La multinacional, que ha destinado 100 millones de euros al programa durante cinco años, mantiene hasta el 30 de septiembre el plazo para que startups, pymes y empresas consolidadas presenten soluciones.

La compañía busca impulsar la transición de la industria de la cosmética hacia un modelo más sostenible, bajo en carbono y respetuoso con la biodiversidad, al tiempo que fomenta la colaboración con el ecosistema emprendedor.

""Buscamos acelerar nuestra transformación para cumplir con nuestros ambiciosos objetivos de 2030; reinventar la experiencia de belleza a través de la Beauty Tech; y mantenernos a la vanguardia, con tecnologías que nos permitan seguir siendo líderes y definir el futuro del sector"", explica Juan Alonso de Lomas, CEO de L’Oréal España, a Invertia.

La Aceleradora de Innovación Sostenible se desarrolla en colaboración con el Instituto de Liderazgo en Sostenibilidad de la Universidad de Cambridge (CISL), que aportará su red internacional de expertos y su experiencia en desarrollo empresarial sostenible para acelerar la llegada al mercado de las soluciones más prometedoras.

El ecosistema nacional, con potencial

Juan Alonso de Lomas subraya que España cuenta con los ingredientes para convertirse en un actor clave: “Un talento científico y técnico de primer nivel, excelentes universidades y centros de investigación, y una creciente especialización en áreas como biotecnología, energías renovables, circularidad y digitalización"".

En este sentido, el grupo asegura que a lo largo de esta convocatoria espera encontrar proyectos y talento que ayuden a liderar el cambio en ámbitos como el desarrollo de nuevos ingredientes, soluciones para la gestión del agua o las denominadas green sciences (ciencias verdes).

Este último término resume un cambio radical en la investigación cosmética: implica reemplazar o complementar los procesos químicos tradicionales con fórmulas inspiradas en la naturaleza, con bajo impacto ambiental y alta eficiencia.

""España puede tener un papel protagonista en esta aceleradora”, añade el directivo. El objetivo de la misma no es solo económico, sino estratégico: ""El retorno que buscamos es la capacidad de cocrear el futuro de la belleza para que L'Oréal Groupe siga siendo tan relevante y pionero en los próximos cien años como lo ha sido hasta ahora"".

Entre los casos de éxito previos, L’Oréal ya ha colaborado con startups como Gjosa, creadora de un cabezal de ducha capaz de reducir hasta un 69% el consumo de agua, o ModiFace, especializada en herramientas de prueba virtual de maquillaje y coloración capilar.

Ambas iniciativas combinan sostenibilidad y tecnología para reinventar la experiencia del consumidor y reducir el impacto ambiental del sector.

Tecnologías para la belleza del futuro

La aceleradora forma parte del plan L’Oréal for the Future, que persigue integrar la sostenibilidad en toda la cadena de valor: desde los ingredientes hasta el packaging, desde la producción hasta las formas de consumo.

El grupo ya está trabajando en soluciones disruptivas que combinan ciencia, tecnología y naturaleza.

El titán del beauty galo colabora con empresas biotecnológicas como Debut, con sede en Estados Unidos, para desarrollar ingredientes bioidénticos esenciales que permitirán crear productos con menor impacto.

A nivel local, con la española Presto Ibérica ha creado un sensor que permite graduar la temperatura del agua para promover un uso más inteligente y eficiente de la misma.

Paralelamente, L'Oréal está volcada en innovaciones como los BioPods, jardines verticales controlados por inteligencia artificial que permiten cultivar ingredientes durante todo el año.

Estos replican las condiciones climáticas óptimas para cada especie vegetal, maximizando la producción de principios activos y reduciendo la presión sobre los ecosistemas naturales.

Otro proyecto expuesto en Le Visionnaire —sede ubicada en París en la que el grupo dio a conocer sus últimos avances en materia de sostenibilidad este verano— es Osmobloom.

Creado con Cosmo International Fragrances, el sistema permite capturar las moléculas aromáticas de las flores sin dañarlas, abriendo la puerta a fragancias más auténticas, éticas y sostenibles.

Un ecosistema en transformación

La aceleradora de L’Oréal Groupe no solo busca financiar proyectos, sino también crear un ecosistema global de innovación sostenible.

El programa incluye un acompañamiento de hasta 12 meses con expertos del CISL y de L’Oréal para que las startups puedan validar sus soluciones, medir su impacto y escalar su modelo de negocio a nivel internacional. Las áreas en las que pueden inscribirse los interesados son amplias:

Soluciones con bajo impacto de carbono y adaptadas al cambio climático

Resiliencia hídrica

Propuestas basadas en la naturaleza, ingredientes y materiales alternativos

Eliminación del uso de plásticos fósiles y de residuos plásticos

Circularidad y gestión de recursos

Modelos de negocio sostenibles e inclusivos

Este enfoque es paralelo a una demanda creciente de los consumidores. Según datos internos de L’Oréal, el 78% de los usuarios quiere productos más sostenibles, pero muchos no saben cómo integrarlos en su rutina.

La compañía ve en la tecnología a una vía para cerrar esa brecha y ofrecer soluciones que combinen eficacia, transparencia y respeto por el medioambiente. Y, en esta hoja de ruta, las startups son un pilar fundamental.

En palabras del director ejecutivo para España y Portugal, ""tenemos un fuerte compromiso con el modelo de investigación y la innovación 'abierta', y las vemos como socias estratégicas que nos aportan agilidad, disrupción y perspectivas frescas, elementos cruciales en el dinámico sector de la belleza"".

L'Oréal, alineado con Europa

Con más de 4.000 investigadores y 6.400 expertos tecnológicos y digitales en el mundo, L’Oréal Groupe quiere situarse a la vanguardia de la sostenibilidad en la industria.

Sus objetivos se alinean con el Pacto Verde Europeo, con metas concretas como reducir en un 57% las emisiones directas para 2030 y lograr que todos sus centros en Europa funcionen con energía 100% renovable.

Además, la multinacional ha lanzado iniciativas para reducir la huella digital de su publicidad y fomentar modelos de negocio circulares, como el #JoinTheRefillMovement, que promueve la recarga de perfumes, cremas y champús para reducir el uso de envases de un solo uso.

Ante la urgencia climática actual, ""nos estamos quedando sin tiempo, necesitamos acelerar"", subrayan desde la compañía, convencidos de que la colaboración con el ecosistema emprendedor será clave para alcanzar estos ambiciosos objetivos.

La primera convocatoria de la aceleradora se cierra en pocas semanas, pero L'Oréal Groupe espera que sea solo el comienzo de una nueva etapa de alianzas entre la gran industria y las startups.",https://s2.elespanol.com/2025/09/07/actualidad/1003743915064_258516684_1706x960.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:30.931546

For H&M Group, the Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding represents both a defensive maneuver and an offensive strategy to reclaim relevance in a fragmented market. By blending cutting-edge product innovation with a recalibrated sustainability narrative, the Swedish retailer is attempting to redefine its value proposition in an era where ethical consumption and design excellence are no longer optional but expected.

Product Innovation and Rebranding: Bridging Fast Fashion and High-End Appeal

H&M's Fall/Winter 2025 collection introduces technologies such as HEATTECH, PUFFTECH, and AIRism, which aim to merge functionality with style. These innovations—designed to regulate temperature, enhance insulation, and improve breathability—signal a departure from the brand's traditional fast-fashion identity, positioning it as a purveyor of value-driven technical apparelH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. Complementing this is the appointment of Glenn Martens as creative collaborator for AW25, a move that injects high-fashion credibility into the brand's offerings. Martens' collaboration, coupled with the launch of an elevated ""Atelier"" collection for men and the phasing out of virgin down by 2025, underscores H&M's ambition to attract consumers seeking both quality and sustainabilityH&M - FashionNetwork.com Worldwide[ 5 ].

The rebranding also includes a physical and digital overhaul. Plans to renovate 250 stores and deploy pop-up activations in key markets aim to create immersive shopping experiences, while RFID technology and a redesigned website will streamline inventory management and customer engagementH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. These efforts align with broader industry trends emphasizing omnichannel integration, as highlighted in Fast Fashion Trends 2025Fast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ].

Sustainability Strategies: Progress, Paradoxes, and Public Skepticism

H&M's sustainability roadmap for 2025 includes a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2040H&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. The company has also increased the share of recycled materials in its products to 29.5% in 2024, nearing its 30% targetH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 6 ]. Initiatives like agrivoltaics in Bangladesh and AI-powered garment sorting systems further demonstrate its commitment to circularityH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. However, these efforts are shadowed by persistent allegations of greenwashing. Critics argue that H&M's ""Conscious"" collections and environmental scorecards have historically overstated sustainability benefits while failing to address systemic issues like labor rights and the environmental toll of its fast-fashion modelFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ].

The tension between H&M's aspirational goals and its operational reality is stark. While the brand has localized production to reduce emissions and improve responsivenessH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ], its reliance on low-cost, high-volume manufacturing remains at odds with long-term sustainability. As noted in How Ethical Is H&M?, the company has yet to ensure living wages across its supply chainFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ]. This duality risks eroding consumer trust, particularly among Gen Z and Millennial shoppers who prioritize authenticityH&M - FashionNetwork.com Worldwide[ 5 ].

Financial Performance and Market Position: A Delicate Balancing Act

H&M's financials reflect both resilience and vulnerability. For FY24, the company reported a 10% sales growth and a 12% increase in operating profitH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. However, Q1 2025 results revealed a 37% year-over-year decline in operating profit to SEK 1.2 billion, attributed to markdowns and supply chain disruptionsH&M Trend Dresses: Balancing Fast Fashion & ...[ 7 ]. Inventory levels rose by 9%, signaling overstocking challengesH&M Trend Dresses: Balancing Fast Fashion & ...[ 7 ]. These figures highlight the difficulty of transitioning from a volume-driven model to one prioritizing profitability and sustainability.

The Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding is positioned as a solution to this dilemma. By emphasizing premium price points (e.g., $200 faux-fur coats alongside $15 basics) and reducing reliance on discounts, H&M aims to stabilize margins while appealing to a broader demographicH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. Yet, analysts caution that the ""middle market"" strategy—sandwiched between luxury aspirants and ultra-fast fashion—is inherently precarious. As Business of Fashion notes, H&M must convince consumers that its offerings are both aspirational and affordable, a tightrope walk in an era of polarized spending habitsH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ].

Expert Analysis: Risks and Opportunities in a Transformed Sector

Third-party evaluations of H&M's rebranding efforts underscore a mix of optimism and skepticism. On one hand, the brand's investment in circularity—such as its Pre-Loved secondhand platform and Lab innovation hub—aligns with growing demand for sustainable consumptionFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ]. On the other, the Business of Fashion's 2022 Sustainability Index gave H&M a score of 28/100, citing insufficient transparency in addressing environmental and social challenges2nd Edition of Business of Fashion's Sustainability Index[ 8 ]. This gap between ambition and execution could hinder long-term growth.

Moreover, H&M's new CEO, Daniel Ervér, faces the daunting task of reconciling profitability with sustainability. His focus on a 10% operating margin target and store network optimizationPREVIEW H&M's new boss Erver faces battle to reboot sales[ 4 ] suggests a pragmatic approach, but the success of these strategies will depend on execution.

Conclusion: A Catalyst for Growth or a Fleeting Revival?

H&M's Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding encapsulates the broader challenges facing the retail sector: how to innovate without compromising ethics, how to compete in a polarized market, and how to align with consumer values without falling into performative sustainability. While the company's technological advancements and design collaborations offer a compelling value proposition, its ability to sustain growth will hinge on addressing systemic issues in its supply chain and business model.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 10:12:54.708717

The $46 billion union that once represented a grand vision for the food industry is now being dismantled, leaving investors to question whether this represents a strategic masterstroke or an admission of fundamental failure.

Market Reaction and Historical Context

The announcement sent Kraft Heinz shares tumbling 6.4% in Tuesday's trading session, marking the most significant single-day decline since May 2022. This unanimous board decision effectively dismantles the original vision championed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, proposing a tax-free separation of the business into distinct entities.

The move comes against a troubling backdrop: Kraft Heinz stock has lost approximately 60% of its value since the 2015 merger, with the company continuing to struggle against declining sales and substantial debt burdens. The separation now appears designed to salvage value where consolidation ultimately failed to deliver.

The New Corporate Structure

Under the proposed split, two distinct companies will emerge with clearly defined portfolios. The first entity, temporarily designated ""Global Taste Elevation Co.,"" will incorporate the faster-growing international brands including Heinz Ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. This division generated $15.4 billion in 2024 revenue, with emerging markets contributing 20% of its sales, positioning it as the growth engine of the separation.

The second company, ""North American Grocery Co.,"" will focus on traditional U.S. household brands including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables. Despite generating $10.4 billion in annual revenue, this segment is viewed as having limited growth potential—a primary source of investor skepticism regarding the separation.

Divergent Analyst Perspectives

Wall Street analysts have expressed conflicting views on the strategic move. Morgan Stanley surprisingly upgraded Kraft Heinz from ""underweight"" to ""equal weight"" while raising its price target to $29. Analyst Megan Alexander suggested the negative thesis had ""largely played out"" and that current estimates appeared ""more realistic.""

In contrast, Mizuho analyst John Baumgartner maintained a cautious stance, noting that while the separation might establish a ""floor under the stock,"" fundamental growth concerns would likely constrain significant upside potential.

Execution Challenges and Timeline

The corporate divorce carries substantial financial implications, including approximately $300 million in annual additional costs resulting from lost synergies. The separation also represents one of the most significant corporate splits in recent memory, introducing considerable execution risk during the transition period.

The transaction is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2026, providing ample time for further market volatility as details emerge. Whether this radical move will ultimately create two stronger competitors or simply formalize the breakdown of a failed vision remains uncertain.

Price rollbacks have helped Walmart maintain its shopper value proposition, with the number of rollbacks in grocery, for example, up 30% versus a year earlier.
“Hopefully, things get settled sooner rather than later and at lower rates than what’s being discussed right now.
And we have to be thoughtful about things like higher price points.
If you pass on the entire impact of a tariff at a higher price point, it can put it out a range, and you really see a unit decline.","NEW YORK — Expect consumers to feel pressured through the rest of this year – and maybe into next year – as tariffs fuel an inflationary environment and stir shopper uncertainty, Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer of Walmart, told the investment community at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference.

“If you look at the middle to upper income levels, we’re seeing strong demand, and if you look at middle to lower, there has been a little bit of stress,” McMillon said in a fireside chat at the investor event in New York. “We’ve seen behavioral change on items that have gone up in cost because of tariffs, where they’re switching from one item to the other – some of the behavioral stuff that you always see during times of pressure.”

When reporting fiscal 2026 second-quarter results two weeks ago, Walmart executives described consumers as hard-pressed but exhibiting consistent shopping behavior, with no pronounced shifts thus far in response to tariffs.

“Generally speaking, people have held up really well, and we expect the same thing to happen for the balance of the year,” McMillon said at the conference. “This quarter started off in the same strong fashion on the top line, so we’re continuing to see what happened in the second quarter spill into the third quarter.”

Walmart US second-quarter net sales climbed 4.8% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the grocery and health-and-wellness categories plus a 26% jump in e-commerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel gained 4.6%, aided by upticks in average ticket size and transaction count. Price rollbacks have helped Walmart maintain its shopper value proposition, with the number of rollbacks in grocery, for example, up 30% versus a year earlier.

“US inflation is low single digits; that doesn’t tell the whole story,” McMillon explained to investors. “If you look at what’s happened in the food categories, particularly prepared foods, processed foods, dry grocery, stuff like that, we’ve seen prices go up for multiple years now. So absolute pricing levels in food are higher than we want them to be and higher than what American families would want it to be.

“And then on the general merchandise side, we saw prices go up as supply chains got stretched after the pandemic, and then GM (general merchandise) prices came down. What’s happened more recently – because of what’s happening with tariffs – is we’ve seen a steady march up, kind of a gradual increase, as it relates to our cost levels in general merchandise, which has created the single-digit inflation that we find ourselves dealing with now.”

Price elasticity has been “better than I thought” in the current consumer environment, according to McMillon.

“When items go up, we see units go down in some corresponding fashion as people switch to other items,” he said. “Customers are really smart and rational, and they move from one item to another from one category to another as they see prices change.”

Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2026, Walmart lifted its adjusted earnings-per-share estimates at the bottom and top ends by 2¢, to between $2.52 and $2.62. Its net sales growth forecast was raised by three-quarters of a percentage point at both ends, to between 3.75% and 4.75%.

“For the balance of the year, we would say it’s the same, and I think next year we’ll see this cost pressure that’s flowing through the system play out over time,” McMillon said. “So far, it has been gradual and, therefore, the impact has been somewhat muted. So, it’s not a situation where I can tell you when things are going to be different. And in fact, if they are, I think consistency is the answer.”

Tariffs will tell much of the tale in terms of the elasticity response to pricing actions, McMillon said. Less than a third of what Walmart sells in the United States is imported, with China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada being the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer’s biggest markets.

“It depends on the tariff level, of course, and what happens with countries like India,” he said. “Hopefully, things get settled sooner rather than later and at lower rates than what’s being discussed right now. We’d like a quick resolution and overall lower rates. Customers are going to be rational. And we have to be thoughtful about things like higher price points. If you pass on the entire impact of a tariff at a higher price point, it can put it out a range, and you really see a unit decline. So, we do things like spread within categories and across categories within GM to help manage that, trying to protect food prices and keep some separation there.”",https://www.meatpoultry.com/ext/resources/2025/09/09/Walmart-Lead_adst_Sundry-Photography.jpg?height=635&t=1757436288&width=1200,N,,2025-09-10 09:12:05.262880

There are 113 Game stores in Africa, 100 of which are in South Africa.
There are 37 Cash & Carry stores in the country, 27 in South Africa with other locations in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zambia.
There are 7 Jumbo stores in South Africa that sell clothing, food and consumer goods.","Walmart, the sole owner of South African retailer Massmart, plans to open Walmart branded stores in South Africa later this year. The retailer noted the action at its first Growth Summit in Sub-Saharan Africa in April.

The event featured suppliers from 12 African countries with innovations and products that are made, grown, or assembled in Africa. Walmart said the event resulted in the recruitment of small- to medium-sized African-based suppliers.

“Walmart’s South African stores will offer a wide range of merchandise, including fresh groceries, household essentials, apparel and technology,” said Kath McLay, CEO of Walmart International. “Walmart will also offer a variety of locally sourced products. By partnering with South African suppliers and entrepreneurs, Walmart will bring its signature Every Day Low Prices and global standards to the market, while celebrating the country’s rich culture.”

With sites already in development, Walmart said the new stores are set to open before the end of the year. The official opening dates and location details will be released in October. Walmart said its business in South Africa will include online commerce.

Walmart acquired a 51% interest in Massmart in 2011 for $2.3 billion. But in August 2023, Walmart purchased the outstanding shares for $377.6 million, giving it full ownership over the business. Civil unrest throughout areas of Africa and a volatile economic climate over the years had Walmart re-evaluate its business interests on the continent in 2019. Several management changes and a slow build-out for stores in underserved countries ensued.

Walmart brought in new Massmart management in March, with Miles Van Rensburg becoming CEO, the fourth CEO in six years. Massmart announced in June three more executive changes for its Makro, Game, and Cash & Carry businesses.

Walmart/Massmart owns and operates 302 retail units in Africa under the Builders, Cambridge, Cash & Carry, Jumbo, Makro and Rhino store banners. Builders is based in South Africa and is a home improvement and materials company that operates warehouses, express and superstore formats at 120 locations.

Game is a discount retailer that focuses on appliances, electronics, lifestyle merchandise, groceries, liquor and some services. There are 113 Game stores in Africa, 100 of which are in South Africa. The Makro stores are similar to a Sam’s Club format, selling food, liquor and general merchandise to retail and wholesale customers. There are 23 Makro locations, all of which are in South Africa.

There are 37 Cash & Carry stores in the country, 27 in South Africa with other locations in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zambia. Like Makro, the Cash & Carry format sells food and general merchandise for commercial and wholesale customers. There are 7 Jumbo stores in South Africa that sell clothing, food and consumer goods.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/massmart-builders.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:11:26.683810

Fifth Third Bank said Tuesday that the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service has designated the Cincinnati-based lender as the next financial agent for the U.S. government's Direct Express prepaid debit card program.

The decision marks a reversal from last November, when the Fiscal Service Bureau said that it had selected The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. as the program's financial agent.

A BNY spokesperson said in an email late Tuesday that the New York-based bank was selected in November 2024 ""along with a group of additional new service providers,"" and that the Fiscal Service Bureau ""made the decision to discontinue the agreement"" as a result of ""readiness challenges involving one of the providers.""

Fifth Third and the Treasury Department did not provide additional comment on the demise of the BNY agreement.

Fifth Third said in a press release that it has reached a five-year agreement with the Fiscal Service Bureau, and that the agreement started on Tuesday. The bureau's earlier agreement with BNY was also for five years, according to a November 2024 press release, and had been scheduled to start on Jan. 3, 2025.

As of Tuesday evening, the Fiscal Service Bureau had not posted a new press release to its website. But Fifth Third's own release included a quote from the bureau's commissioner, Tim Gribben.

""Direct Express plays a critical role in delivering federal benefits payments electronically, especially lifeline payments such as Social Security and Veterans benefits,"" Gribben said in Fifth Third's release.

Gribben, who previously worked at the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Small Business Administration, was appointed commissioner of the Fiscal Service Bureau in May 2019, according to the bureau's website.

Fifth Third said in its release that the Fiscal Service Bureau ""determined that Fifth Third has the vision and capability to expand the Direct Express program over the five-year term to deliver compelling mobile applications and digital options designed to provide frictionless value for millions of debit card recipients.""

""This transition marks a step forward in the Fiscal Service's mission to provide a modern, seamless and secure payment experience for federal benefit recipients,"" Fifth Third said.

The Direct Express program provides prepaid debit cards that enable roughly 3.4 million Americans, most of whom do not have a bank account, to receive monthly federal benefits, according to Fifth Third.

The banking unit of the $210 billion-asset Fifth Third Bancorp said in its release that it plans to ""offer recipients more freedom and convenience to access federal benefits with new or enhanced solutions such as virtual cards, cardless ATM access, rent and other bill payment services, digital wallet integration and more.""

""We're focused on delivering secure, high-quality financial services that make banking more accessible for millions of Americans,"" said Bridgit Chayt, head of commercial payments at Fifth Third, in the release.

Fifth Third also said that Money Network Financial, LLC, will serve as Direct Express' program manager, and that the program will continue to run on Mastercard's network, as it has since 2008.

The Direct Express program faced problems under its previous financial agent, Comerica Bank. Dallas-based Comerica faced allegations that it shared sensitive consumer data with vendors and failed to reimburse government beneficiaries who claimed their benefits had been stolen due to fraud.

Also on Tuesday, Fifth Third disclosed that it recently discovered what it characterized as ""alleged fraudulent activity"" in connection with a commercial borrower's asset-backed finance loan, saying that it expects to take a non-cash impairment charge of $170 million-$200 million in the third quarter.

The loan in question has an unpaid principal balance of roughly $200 million, Fifth Third said in a securities filing. The bank added that it ""is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/624cda0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2Fd0%2F75d1facf42e1bdcb31ef56282a80%2F397528604.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:11:18.480294

Zipline, a San Francisco-based robotics company that designs, manufactures, and operates what it says is the world’s largest autonomous delivery system, has launched service for customers who live near the Walmart Supercenter at 7401 Samuell Blvd., just south of U.S. Highway 80. Shoppers in the area can now get up to 5.5 pounds of goods delivered in minutes by drone.

More than 65,000 items from the store are eligible for delivery in under 20 minutes, the company said. That includes fresh and frozen food, pantry staples, and essentials like baby formula.

Zipline said its all-electric, autonomous aircraft have flown more than 100 million commercial miles across four continents and delivered more than 18 million products.

The Samuell Boulevard location is the seventh Walmart Supercenter in North Texas that now offers Zipline delivery. Other participating stores are in Mesquite, Waxahachie, Kaufman, Greenville, Bedford, and Weatherford.

The company said it has made more than 1.4 million commercial deliveries to date and has safely flown the equivalent of every road in America 24 times without incident.

UnitedHealth expects to have roughly 78% of its Medicare Advantage enrollees in plans rated four stars or above next year, the healthcare behemoth disclosed Tuesday in a securities filing.

The percentage of members in the high-performing plans — which yield valuable bonuses — has stayed largely flat compared to 2025, according to analysts. But it’s still a positive development for UnitedHealth, and a good sign for other managed care companies in MA, many of which have struggled to reach stricter star ratings thresholds.

UnitedHealth’s stock rose roughly 9% over Tuesday’s trade following the disclosure, which also shared that the company plans to reaffirm its 2025 financial guidance in upcoming investor meetings.

Dive Insight:

The CMS rates MA plans from one to five stars based on a complex calculation of metrics that, overall, are meant to represent plan quality. Insurers jockey fiercely for higher ratings, which help their plans stand out for seniors shopping for privatized Medicare coverage — and translate directly to higher revenue from the government.

As such, insurers were generally unhappy with tweaks to star ratings methodology that tamped down on average scores for 2025, including by making it harder to reach the vaunted four-star cutoff. (Plans that receive an overall rating of four or higher receive higher bonus payments, and higher scores also result in larger rebates if plans submit bids below the CMS’ benchmark for the coming year.)

With billions of dollars in payments at stake, multiple insurers sued the government to get their ratings recalculated, with mixed results. And executives and investors in the industry have been waiting anxiously for signs of how the quality scores could come down for 2026. The CMS officially releases stars for the upcoming plan year in October, but allows plans to take a first look at their data. Payers’ second window to check out their preliminary results opened on Tuesday, and UnitedHealth is electing to share its early results with investors.

Having more than three-fourths of its more than 8 million MA members in plans with at least four stars is “consistent with our expectations and in line with historical performance,” UnitedHealth wrote in its securities filing.

Still, the results are better than some investors feared, especially amid concerns that thresholds to reach four stars could increase further for 2026.

“Our biggest takeaway is that we aren’t seeing a material upward shift in stars similar to last year,” J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note Tuesday.

Major health insurers are currently hustling to boost margins in their MA businesses, as higher medical utilization among seniors and unfavorable policy changes cut into once-comfortable profits.

With an eye toward improving margins, payers — including UnitedHealth’s insurance division UnitedHealthcare — are culling unprofitable plans for next year. UnitedHealthcare expects to lose some 600,000 enrollees as a result of the plan exits.

Despite higher MA rates coming down the pike, where star ratings land is another major swing factor for insurers’ margin recovery plans — especially for insurers that have room for improvement in their scores.

Humana, the second-largest MA insurer after UnitedHealthcare, said during a second-quarter call with investors that it expects its star ratings to improve for 2026, though the company doesn’t plan to discuss its results until stars are officially released in October.

Elevance also said it wouldn’t explicitly comment on stars during an investor conference last week, though CFO Mark Kaye said the company was encouraged by its progress. Centene has also said it expects its stars to improve next year.

UnitedHealth, Humana, Elevance, Centene and CVS, the parent company of insurer Aetna, did not respond to a request for comment for this story by time of publication.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gp7-9yDSiCZQoGHBzNxfophsasMnSZtZnJ8p0ayp8-U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS91bml0ZWRfaGVhbHRoX2dyb3VwLmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2025-09-09 21:07:23.776192

Which is what Ralph Lauren has done with its latest AI element, with Microsoft’s AI tools powering a new product matching tool that can help users style their looks, based on Ralph Lauren items.
But then again, depending on exactly how it determines product matches, maybe you’ll just end up looking more like a Ralph Lauren model, as opposed to having any individual style.
In terms of specifics, Microsoft doesn’t provide a heap of insight into how the system determines relevant matches, only noting that: “Ask Ralph delivers tailored responses to a user’s prompts, curating outfits and looks from across the Polo Ralph Lauren brand, with all items suggested from available inventory.

Which is what Ralph Lauren has done with its latest AI element, with Microsoft’s AI tools powering a new product matching tool that can help users style their looks, based on Ralph Lauren items.

As explained by Microsoft:

“Ask Ralph is a conversational AI shopping experience built on Azure OpenAI, and available in the Ralph Lauren app in the U.S. You can interact with Ask Ralph just like you would a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store by asking simple, conversational questions or using prompts to find the perfect look for any occasion.”

So if you want to know what goes best with a pair of shoes that you like, or a specific color of shirt, “Ask Ralph” will be able to give you styling notes, based on commonly purchased items, curated looks, what other people have searched for in relation to each item, etc.

Which is kind of personalized, I guess, in that it’s an open prompt, and you can direct how it finds related products. But then again, depending on exactly how it determines product matches, maybe you’ll just end up looking more like a Ralph Lauren model, as opposed to having any individual style.

Though the market demand for that would be high either way, as a lot of people simply want to look their best, and are seeking guidance on how to do that.

In terms of specifics, Microsoft doesn’t provide a heap of insight into how the system determines relevant matches, only noting that:

“Ask Ralph delivers tailored responses to a user’s prompts, curating outfits and looks from across the Polo Ralph Lauren brand, with all items suggested from available inventory. Ask Ralph can also interpret tone, satisfaction, and intent to refine recommendations dynamically. It also adapts to contextual cues like location-based insights or event-driven needs.”

So there’s not a lot of info on how, exactly, the tool decides what fits best with each other item, but presumably, it’s being guided by the factors noted above.

And again, this is what AI is good for, cross-matching large datasets to find commonalities and correlations that are beyond the capacity of other systems. The capacity to translate natural language searches into complex queries for such purpose is a huge benefit, and there are a range of ways that this could help to streamline and improve various actions that relate to such functions.

The stores that remain open will be part of a “focus on growth.”

The Alamosa Safeway store was on a list of stores to be sold under an earlier merger effort between Kroger Co. and Albertsons. That deal, however, fell apart after Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and other attorneys general sued to block the sale and Kroger decided to halt its effort to acquire Albertsons.

Albertsons now has restructured itself in Colorado, leaving the Alamosa and Monte Vista Safeway stores with new life.

“Together, these changes position us to operate in new and innovative ways that foster customer loyalty and drive long-term success,” said Halpape.

Typically, CVS Caremark passes the money from medication discounts and rebates to HealthChoice.
However, according to the State of Oklahoma, CVS was accused of having kept millions of dollars from January 2020 through December 2024.
The settlement agreement reached between the state and CVS Caremark requires the company to pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma.
Roughly $27 million will go to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days.","OKLAHOMA CITY — A $32 million settlement has been reached with CVS Caremark following accusations that the company kept money that belonged to Oklahoma’s state employee health plan.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond shared on Tuesday that a settlement had been reached.

“When a company keeps money that belongs to Oklahoma taxpayers, we’re going to fight to get it back,” said Attorney General Drummond. “This settlement ensures that millions of dollars go where they should have gone all along — to benefit our state employees’ healthcare.”

CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager that handles prescription drug benefits for health plans, such as Oklahoma’s state employee plan HealthChoice.

Typically, CVS Caremark passes the money from medication discounts and rebates to HealthChoice. However, according to the State of Oklahoma, CVS was accused of having kept millions of dollars from January 2020 through December 2024. The company denied those claims.

The settlement agreement reached between the state and CVS Caremark requires the company to pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma. Roughly $27 million will go to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days.

“This settlement ensures millions of dollars will be directed back to the HealthChoice plan, benefitting Oklahoma’s state employees and their families,” said Ellen Buettner, CEO of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA). “This recovery underscores OHCA’s commitment to maximizing the value of healthcare benefits for those who serve our state.”

CVS Caremark will also be required to pay any additional rebate amounts from the 2020-2024 period within 90 days, pass all future rebate payments directly to the HealthChoice plan within 90 days of collection, and agree to a broader definition of ‘rebate’ in the state contract.

None of the money collected for the HealthChoice plan will stay with the Attorney General’s Office. All the funds will go back to the state plan.

“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” said Drummond. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.”

CVS Caremark denied all accusations but has agreed to the settlement agreement to avoid any further uncertainties in litigation.",https://cmg-cmg-rd-20111-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com%2Fcmg%2FXIQMXHL7D5FMTFHRSGECUUFZT4.jpg?auth=433dd850ae69ec7722e11855859ba13ab37e8f306a427910958c634ffc7bce5c&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:14.104432

Residents complained about increased traffic on main and side roads, increased noise and light pollution. In June, the planning commission of Edmond, Oklahoma, denied plans for a 44,000-square-foot Walmart Neighborhood Market grocery store — nearly 100 residents had attended a public meeting to voice concerns.

Still, a Walmart spokesperson told Modern Retail its three newest stores that opened over the last few months in Cypress, Texas; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Eagle Mountain, Utah have been celebrated by their respective communities and have attracted crowds of people.

“We are always looking for opportunities to grow and better serve local communities, and we will continue to explore ways to meet the needs of our customers,” the spokesperson said.

In the past, criticism against Walmart has largely centered around how the company treats its employees. From 2012 to 2014, OUR Walmart (Organization United for Respect at Walmart) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union organized employee walkouts throughout the country, seeking better wages and working conditions for Walmart workers. In 2015, workers in dozens of cities joined the “Fight for $15” movement, walking out and protesting to raise the federal minimum wage.

However, many of the more recent concerns are those often expressed by residents in rural communities or exurbs opposing any new construction near their homes — not anything specific to how Walmart conducts its business.

“I think it applies to any kind of development or project in the community. Even if you’re in a big city or a small town, I think the issues are the same; the neighbors take an interest in what’s going to happen,” said Alice Jump, a partner for law firm Reavis Page Jump LLP in New York City. “I find that most people don’t want change. If they’re happy with their neighborhood, they don’t want something that’s going to change it.”

Mixed reception from neighbors

Comments from neighbors can often range from legitimate concerns to those that are far-flung from reality, Jump said, adding that some will even try to promote conspiracy theories or simply get attention. It’s just part of meeting the public, she noted.

Some in the Iowa town said building a Walmart Supercenter would harm their community’s residential character. Others claimed the store could hurt home values, though a 2012 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research instead found new Walmart stores actually would increase housing prices by up to 3%. In May, the city said the zoning application was still on hold to conduct a traffic survey, according to the NBC affiliate, and the current status remains unclear. Walmart has not broken ground on this project, according to a spokesperson.

“Our community is a peaceful residential area, crafted through years of planning and love. We consciously chose to build and buy in this bedroom community, cherishing the quiet and safe environment,” one nearby resident Clint Rocker wrote in a Change.org petition signed by almost 1,800 people. “The recent proposal to rezone our neighborhood for commercial purposes … threatens our cherished tranquility.”

Another Ankeny resident, Trevor Meeks, said, “If you introduce a big-box retailer right in the middle of a residential area like this, it’s going to create new noise pollution, new light pollution,” per WHO 13. “It’s going to be a lot of trash blowing around. It’s going to create a very large new traffic load.”

In Oklahoma, similar to those in Iowa, Edmond residents wanted to preserve property values, prevent an increase in traffic, and protect the plants and animals on the site. Members of the planning commission raised issues of the architectural compatibility of the proposed Walmart with surrounding structures, according to nonprofit news outlet NonDoc.

During the meeting, NonDoc reported, an attorney for the developers argued that the project met all code requirements and that his client would work with city staff to meet or exceed all city codes related to preservation of nature and lighting.

“What more can a property owner or developer do, other than comply with the rules as prescribed by the city?” the attorney, David Box, asked. “There’s nothing more they can do. To put additional requirements would be absolutely subjective and violate every principle of development and every principle of legal authority that exists for the State of Oklahoma.”

In St. Johns County, Florida, near Jacksonville, some residents in December expressed concerns about adding more development — including a Walmart Supercenter — near a Buc-ee’s travel center and Interstate 95 due to traffic, NBC affiliate First Coast News reported.

“There’s people that don’t even live in this area that already talk bad about how bad it is driving here,” one resident, Cindy Chong, told the broadcaster.

According to First Coast News, entitlements had already been granted in 2003, and the county attorney said nothing could be done to stop the development, though the store itself had yet to be approved. Walmart has not broken ground in St. Johns Country, per a spokesperson.

Jump said that for retailers or developers, bringing in senior executives can help corporations not come off as corporate behemoths and diffuse these sorts of situations. She added that developers may also include public parks or playgrounds to give communities a benefit for approving big projects.

“What developers have to do is prepare the groundwork: Go in with knowledge of the players, in terms of who the people are on the zoning board, or whatever structure there is in the particular area, who have to review or approve it, and maybe engage with with community leaders before there’s any kind of official legal action to be taken,” Jump said. “It’s almost a PR process as much as a legal process. Explain the benefits, maybe diffuse the criticism by being empathetic to what the community is concerned about and addressing that.”

Not all communities have been combative toward Walmart.

For example, the planning commission in Columbia, Tennessee approved construction of a 45,000-square-foot Walmart store. Columbia Vice Mayor Randy McBroom praised the design in a public meeting, according to the Columbia Daily Herald.

“I appreciate the way it looks, because it doesn’t look like a Walmart, but more like a medical building,” McBroom said.

Changing perceptions

Still, Walmart is seeking local approvals in a different environment than it operated in 10 or 15 years ago. The big-box giant has worked to improve its image, both in terms of how it pays employees and the aesthetic of its stores, as well as its brand equity among higher-income shoppers.

“A lot of more affluent shoppers relied on Walmart for e-commerce grocery delivery during the pandemic and have since discovered that Walmart’s not a terrible place to shop,” said Bryan Gildenberg, founder and CEO of Confluencer Commerce, adding that it helps that the company has made its stores — as he describes — more aesthetically pleasing. “As a result, you don’t have the visceral reaction to a Walmart coming that you might if you walked into a Walmart store 30 years ago and found it to be a little bare-bones and underkept for your taste.”

Anne Mezzenga, co-CEO of Omni Talk and a former marketing leader at Target, added that the investments Walmart has made in supply chain infrastructure, store redesigns and marketing … continue to change consumer sentiment around the brand.

“Their deep push into fashion right now — providing consumers really the only place to go right now for reliable low prices and the convenience of a mass retailer, [and] having everything that they would need to purchase in one trip — [have] changed the perception is of Walmart, and I think will continue to change it in the coming years,” Mezzenga said.

The company has also worked on its perception on pay and salaries, promoting opportunities for career advancement and higher salaries, especially in management roles. In 2015, Walmart raised entry-level wages to $9 per hour, and again in 2016 to $10 per hour. By 2021, Walmart increased its average pay to more than $15 an hour, though it kept its minimum starting wage at $11 an hour.

“Walmart, in particular, has worked very hard to reposition themselves as investing in the communities where they are building their stores and the people in those communities,” Mezzenga said. “I think that’s paying off for them now.”

This year, Walmart expanded its 10% employee discount to include most grocery products. The company last year implemented a new bonus for hourly store associates based on how they drive sales and profit. It said earlier this year that market managers can make up to $620,000 after stock grants and bonuses, and in 2024, it raised the average salary for store managers to $128,000 a year.

“In general, retail is no longer the low platform on the toting pole, in terms of pay in a given geography,” Gildenberg said, adding that there are other sectors that wage-related activism now centers on. “If you’re worried about deflating wage costs, which was one of the big pressure points that Walmart got for years, … you’re going to worry about what gig workers are paid.”

Additionally, Gartner retail analyst Brad Jashinsky said that, after the last few years of high inflation, value-focused retailers especially resonate with people in a positive way. “They can accurately say that they’re able to bring in more options, more affordability into these communities,” Jashinsky said.

Another change over the last few decades is the number of companies that are active in small towns, including e-commerce businesses, that now also get a share of negative attention. Even retailers like Target that once stuck closer to big cities have expanded into very rural areas.

“There are a lot more retailers that are coming in, whereas 20, 30 years ago, Walmart would be the big story for a year or two while it was [being] developed and coming into a small town,” Jashinsky said. “The landscape has changed significantly.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/2025_5-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:12:10.747161

HP saw AI PC shipments increase faster than anticipated during the three months ending July 31, despite tariff-related supply chain concerns, CFO Karen Parkhill said Monday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference.

The premium units accounted for one-quarter of the company’s Q3 2025 shipments, a threshold HP hadn’t expected to surpass until the end of the year, according to Parkhill. HP anticipates AI-optimized PCs will comprise half of its PC business within the next two years.

“AI PCs are a little bit about future-proofing right now,” said Parkhill, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. “We see CIOs making that decision to refresh their installed base with AI PCs because they don’t want to be outdated in a year or two.”

Dive Insight:

The PC market has been in recovery mode for more than two years, with shipments inching up quarter by quarter after a prolonged, post-pandemic tumble.

Enterprises that invested heavily in hardware to support remote workers in 2020 waited out a looming recession, the arrival of AI PCs and, most recently, the potential effects of a tariff-triggered trade war before embarking on a full refresh.

In the US, shipments were flat during the second quarter, despite a 6.5% year-over-year global increase, according to IDC, as vendors raced to avoid heavy levies.

Adoption of AI PCs slowed during the first half of the year, according to Gartner. Last month, the analyst firm said that AI units will account for less than one-third of global PC sales by the end of the year, down from a prior forecast of 43%.

Prospects for AI PC adoption have been buoyed by a proliferation of portable generative AI apps, modestly sized large language models and task-specific assistants. The broader PC market is being driven by aging enterprise devices and Microsoft’s imminent end-of-support deadline for Windows 10.

“We’re about to move into a COVID-like refresh cycle,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Clark O’Niell told CIO Dive. While O’Niell has yet see a pressing need for PCs with AI processing power, the units are gaining enterprise traction.

“It’s more of a hedge bet right now,” O’Niell said. “You don’t want to be the procurement guy that didn’t invest ahead of the curve for AI.”

HP reduced its exposure to U.S. tariffs by shifting manufacturing locations after President Donald Trump announced the initial regime in April and is bullish on its line of AI PCs and demand for workstations compatible with Windows 11, according to Parkhill.

“We’ve been moving quite rapidly to move our manufacturing and our supply chain outside of China and, by this past quarter, nearly all of the demand that we’ve been fulfilling in the United States has been manufactured outside of China,” said Parkhill. “We’ve moved it to Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico and, the federal business that we have, we produced in the U.S.”

HP saw its revenues increase 3% year over year to $13.9 billion, fueled largely by the ongoing Windows 11 refresh, AI PC adoption and services growth, President and CEO Enrique Lores said during an earnings call last month.

“The key thing behind AI PCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that the AI PCs have,” Lores said, pointing to Adobe and Zoom apps running AI on PCs.

HP expects AI capabilities to raise the average price of its PCs by 5% to 10% over the next few years.

“AI PCs are premium products,” Parkhill said. “They do carry a higher price and higher margin with them.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/0f_1rFjkjuR8785DBnmfQuJLlxiQFeS1DPHfUpaw5UM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTc5MDUzMzMyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-09 18:16:42.319412

The scale of geopolitical risk is reshaping strategies, but businesses have demonstrated resilience and adaptability.
As they continue to navigate these turbulent conditions, creativity and foresight will be essential in charting a course through the evolving global M&A landscape.","M&A activity has faced significant challenges over the past five years. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, which caused deal values and volumes to plummet to their lowest levels in decades, companies worldwide have endured a prolonged period of disruption. As the global economy began to recover, soaring interest rates in 2021 prompted many executives to reassess deal economics, slowing activity to near-pandemic lows. Geopolitical uncertainty – particularly the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East – further compounded these challenges by increasing volatility, impacting valuations and tightening financing conditions. The cumulative effect of these pressures has led to a recalibration of corporate ambition. Where bold expansion plans once dominated boardroom agendas, caution and contingency now prevail.

The war in Ukraine, which began in 2022, has disrupted European security and strained global supply chains, leading to higher costs and operational uncertainty for businesses worldwide. Similarly, conflicts in the Middle East have heightened geopolitical risk, contributing to energy market volatility and broader economic instability. These conflicts have not only reshaped regional alliances but have also forced multinational corporations to reconsider their exposure to politically sensitive jurisdictions.

In response to these dynamics – alongside the enduring lessons of the pandemic and mounting climate risks – many businesses are reassessing their M&A strategies. Boards and investment committees are increasingly scrutinising geopolitical risks in acquisitions, joint ventures and supply chains. Across industry surveys and reports, geopolitical risk is now cited as one of the most influential factors shaping investment strategies. This marks a significant shift in corporate governance, where geopolitical literacy is becoming as essential as financial acumen. The boardroom is no longer a sanctuary from global turbulence – it is a frontline for strategic adaptation.

The shift from growth to risk management

Uneven growth forecasts and abundant dry powder are creating both opportunities and challenges. As of December 2024, global dry powder stood at $2.5 trillion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. US funds lead the way, with firms such as KKR and Apollo Global Management each reportedly holding over $40bn. Political and economic turbulence in the US and Europe throughout 2024 – including widespread elections – prompted many dealmakers to pause and reassess. The sheer volume of undeployed capital is both a source of optimism and anxiety: optimism for potential dealmaking, anxiety due to the pressure to deploy it wisely amid uncertainty. Capital is abundant, but confidence is elusive.

Further complicating the landscape, the impact of US tariffs on various countries and trading blocs has undermined market confidence. Financial markets reacted sharply to tariff announcements, introducing volatility that dampened M&A activity. The most notable concern remains the US-China relationship. Tensions escalated during President Trump’s first term and have continued into his second, with the administration supporting intensified protectionist policies. These include higher tariffs on Chinese imports, stricter enforcement of foreign investment regulations under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and increased scrutiny of Chinese technology investments. This regulatory tightening has led to a chilling effect on cross-border dealmaking, particularly in sectors deemed strategically sensitive.

From January 2025, US persons and their controlled foreign entities became subject to restrictions when engaging in transactions with foreign persons in “countries of concern” – currently limited to China, including the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions – in sensitive sectors such as semiconductors, microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). The European Commission has expressed interest in implementing a similar regime. If adopted, such measures could signal a new era of transatlantic alignment on investment controls, further fragmenting the global M&A landscape.

Despite these headwinds, deals are still being completed. According to PwC, global M&A volumes declined by 9 percent in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, yet deal values rose by 15 percent. Mergermarket data shows that US deal volumes at the start of 2025 fell to their lowest level in over two decades, with only 1100 transactions signed by 18 February – the slowest start since 2003. This divergence between volume and value suggests that while fewer deals are being done, those that proceed are larger, more strategic and more thoroughly vetted. Quality is overtaking quantity as the new metric of deal success.

PwC observed continued activity in companies with a domestic focus and in sectors less exposed to tariffs, such as services. Larger firms with strong cash flow and healthy prospects remain attractive targets. However, companies outside these parameters have struggled. In the US, a PwC Pulse Survey from May 2025 revealed that 30 percent of companies had paused or revisited deals due to tariff uncertainty. Nevertheless, 51 percent of US companies still plan to pursue deals, reflecting a persistent drive to transform and reinvent business models. This resilience underscores the enduring appeal of M&A as a lever for strategic transformation, even in turbulent times.

Boston Consulting Group reported that total global M&A deal value in the first half of 2025 reached $1.1 trillion – a 2 percent decline from the previous six months and below historical averages. Regional disparities were significant. Transactions involving targets in the Americas totalled $724bn, up 23 percent from the second half of 2024. North America, particularly the US, accounted for $685bn, or 62 percent of global deal value. European deal value fell to $201bn, a 14 percent decrease, while Asia-Pacific activity dropped 43 percent to $155bn, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions and local challenges. The steep decline in Asia-Pacific activity highlights the vulnerability of emerging markets to geopolitical shocks and regulatory unpredictability.

Sector performance varied. The industrials sector saw the strongest rebound, with a 62 percent increase in aggregate deal value, followed by energy (54 percent) and healthcare (23 percent). In contrast, the materials and consumer sectors experienced sharp declines of 49 and 50 percent respectively, due to fewer large transactions. This uneven sectoral performance reflects shifting investor priorities, with capital flowing toward resilience and away from discretionary exposure. Investors are chasing certainty, not just returns.

Megadeal activity – defined as transactions exceeding $10bn – remained steady, with 24 deals announced in the first half of 2025, matching the previous six months. However, the number of large deals (valued at over $500m) fell below the long-term average of 60 to 80 per month, indicating continued caution among dealmakers. The persistence of megadeals amid broader caution suggests that strategic imperatives are still driving bold moves, albeit selectively.

Private equity (PE) activity increased during the first half of 2025, as financial sponsors faced mounting pressure to deploy their substantial dry powder. In contrast, early and late stage funding for start-ups remained subdued, despite strong interest in AI ventures. Bifurcation between PE and venture capital reflects differing risk appetites and time horizons in the current climate.

Protectionism and policy: the new barriers to M&A

While the US has led the charge on protectionist policies, it is not alone. Other jurisdictions are also adopting measures that complicate dealmaking. The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, set to take effect in 2026, will impose tariffs on carbon-intensive imports to protect domestic industries. In the UK, the government has expanded its powers to scrutinise and potentially block foreign M&A on national security grounds. The scope of reviewable transactions has widened, particularly in critical sectors such as defence, dual-use technologies and advanced tech. These developments have hindered M&A and deterred foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the Department for Business and Trade, the number of FDI projects in the UK fell to 1375 in the financial year ending March 2025 – a 12 percent decline from the previous year and the lowest level since records began in 2007-08. This decline in FDI is a sobering reminder that national security concerns, while legitimate, can carry unintended economic consequences.

In this climate, dealmakers are increasingly turning to innovative structuring techniques to navigate regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical headwinds. Dual-track processes – where companies simultaneously pursue a sale and an initial public offering – are gaining popularity as a way to hedge against market volatility. Meanwhile, reverse mergers and special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transactions, though less dominant than in previous years, are still being considered in niche scenarios where traditional exits are constrained. Creativity in deal structuring has become a strategic necessity.

Legal and compliance teams are playing a more central role in deal execution, often involved from the earliest stages of due diligence. Their input is critical in assessing exposure to sanctions regimes, export controls and foreign ownership restrictions. This shift reflects a broader trend toward embedding geopolitical intelligence into the core of corporate strategy, rather than treating it as a peripheral concern. The rise of legal foresight as a strategic asset is transforming how deals are conceived, negotiated and closed.

Technology is also reshaping how deals are sourced, evaluated and executed. Advanced analytics and AI-driven platforms are helping firms model complex risk scenarios and simulate post-merger integration outcomes. These tools are particularly valuable in cross-border transactions, where regulatory landscapes can shift rapidly and unpredictably. Digital tools are no longer confined to streamlining operations – they are reshaping how organisations perceive, interpret and act on strategic intelligence.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are becoming more prominent in M&A decision making. Investors and boards are increasingly demanding that acquisitions align with sustainability goals and ethical standards. This has led to heightened scrutiny of targets’ supply chains, labour practices and carbon footprints. In some cases, ESG considerations have been decisive in deal approval or rejection – a compass guiding strategic direction.

The talent dimension of M&A is also evolving. With remote work and digital collaboration now entrenched, integration planning must account for cultural alignment across dispersed teams. Human capital assessments – once a secondary concern – are now central to value creation strategies, especially in knowledge-intensive sectors such as technology and professional services. People strategy is emerging as a critical determinant of post-deal success.

Creativity, compliance and culture

Looking ahead, dealmakers will need to balance agility with discipline. The ability to pivot quickly in response to geopolitical shocks must be matched by rigorous planning and execution. Those who succeed will likely be firms that combine strategic clarity with operational flexibility, supported by robust governance frameworks and a deep understanding of global dynamics. In this new era, adaptability is a competitive advantage.

M&A leaders are refining their strategies in several ways. Risk analysis is being intensified, with robust scenario planning to anticipate disruptions – although the unpredictability of the Trump administration’s tariff policy presents a particular challenge. Firms are also exploring earn-outs and contingent payments to mitigate economic volatility. Many are pivoting toward domestic transactions to reduce cross-border risk. Moreover, dealmakers are prioritising long-term value creation over short-term gains, adopting a more cautious and strategic approach. This recalibration signals a maturing of the M&A mindset – one that favours resilience over rapid returns.

Despite persistent uncertainty, companies remain committed to pursuing M&A. The scale of geopolitical risk is reshaping strategies, but businesses have demonstrated resilience and adaptability. As they continue to navigate these turbulent conditions, creativity and foresight will be essential in charting a course through the evolving global M&A landscape.

The report reveals SFI received contributions from insurer AIG under SFI’s Employment Practices Insurance Policy of €200,000 towards the severance payments and €292,000 in respect of its own legal costs.

The payouts draw the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy and in his report accompanying the financial statements, Mr McCarthy states that ""the net cost to Science Foundation Ireland arising from the termination of the former Director General’s employment was €409,000"".

Professor Nolan took up the prestigious post of Director General at SFI in January 2022 on secondment from Maynooth University and the annual basic salary for the post in 2022 was €222,000.

In the statement read in the Court of Appeal, the State-funded research agency said the litigation with its former chief has been ""damaging to the reputations of all parties"" and it is pleased that they have agreed to bring the case to a conclusion.

Professor Nolan sued the foundation in May 2024 seeking to prevent his dismissal.

The High Court granted him a short injunction halting his dismissal from his director general post for five weeks while various court applications were pending. The same judge, Mr Justice Rory Mulcahy, in June refused to substantially extend the injunction.

The intravesical gemcitabine-releasing system, previously known as TAR-200, treats patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without papillary tumors.

A healthcare professional places TAR-200 into the bladder using a co-packaged urinary placement catheter. The procedure takes place in an outpatient setting in less than five minutes and requires no general anesthesia or further monitoring. Inlexzo remains in the bladder for three weeks per treatment cycle for up to 14 cycles.

According to J&J, it’s the first and only intravesical drug-releasing system (iDRS) to provide extended local delivery of a cancer medication into the bladder.

J&J calls Inlexzo a potentially practice-changing approach for treating certain types of bladder cancer. The FDA granted priority review to a new drug application (NDA) for the system earlier this year.

The Phase 2b SunRISe-1 study, which demonstrated an 82.4% complete response rate, supported the FDA approval. More than half (52.9%) of patients remained cancer-free at least one year or more after achieving a complete response. J&J noted that the majority of adverse reactions proved mild and moderate.

Just as Gemini is known to make up facts for its AI summaries, AI agents can also be prone to hallucinations.
Leading AI agents will be easier in some regards, but some complexities must not be overlooked.
Effectively leading AI teams requires a division of responsibility between AI agents and human workers who use AI to ensure that their skills are best optimized.","Stepping into leadership roles has never been easy, considering the overarching tasks of managing a diverse cast of people, but in the era of AI, matters are growing increasingly more complex. In 2025, we have witnessed the arrival of digital AI employees and colleagues, along with an increasing number of AI tools being introduced to the workplace. These changes demand an altered approach to leadership.

From the supervision of such tools to the management of workers around this technology, the leadership of AI teams requires nuance and consideration. Leading AI agents haven’t become a central responsibility for many managers, leaders, and HR teams just yet, but we see a growing need for a transformation in the management of the AI-empowered workforce.

It’s Time for Manager and HR Teams to Start Leading AI Teams with Greater Care

From financial institutions like BNY Mellon to retailers like Walmart, many organizations have deployed AI agents to bolster their workforce. While some of these agents take the shape of individual employees who are required to report to their own managers, others are mere chatbots that handle some degree of the dissemination of information but perform no other functions independently.

Employees who work alongside these tools are also being instructed to use AI in their own work, with the ability to adapt to these tools, even becoming a part of their performance reviews. Having to grapple with the arrival of AI has already been difficult for those who have lost their jobs as a result, but the impact has been equally severe on workers who are doing their best to adapt to the changing times while worrying about the future of their careers.

Ensuring the right tone of leadership for AI teams requires much of the same traditional skillsets that have been prioritized over the years, but there is also a growing need for a more informed approach to tackling the overlap of tech and humanity.

The Modern Frontier: Leading the AI Transformation and Managing AI Agents

AI is still a new and novel concept for the large majority of businesses, but most are keen on adopting the technology in the near future. The deployment of AI agents is not the first application of this technology for most organizations, but nonetheless, it requires preparation. Unlike their human counterparts, AI agents don’t require empathy and sensitivity, but they do require understanding.

While these AI agents won’t make a demand for better benefits or workplace culture, they likely will require detailed instructions on how to get a job done and the exact parameters that need to be met. AI agents are not designed to make voluntary observations or draw from team learnings unless explicitly taught to do so, making leading AI teams less about collaboration and more about clarity. There is no degree of charisma and competency that will impress the AI to improve its performance.

Unlike what some believe, AI agents are not infallible either. Just as Gemini is known to make up facts for its AI summaries, AI agents can also be prone to hallucinations. A word of caution and correction that may be enough to correct human error may not be sufficient with technology. These fluctuations between human capability and AI potential may appear minor at first glance, but they can have lasting effects on the company’s performance. Leading AI agents will be easier in some regards, but some complexities must not be overlooked.

Leadership for AI Teams Requires an Exploration of the Human Experience

Leading the AI transformation with AI agents is just one part of the challenge that awaits leaders. For the most part, human labor will continue to remain essential to any workforce, even if the nature of their roles and job descriptions evolves. Employees who are asked to utilize AI have concerns of their own, many of which they are likely to be afraid to share for fear of being marked as regressive.

Still, asking questions and understanding these concerns can mean the difference between effective and ineffective adoption of AI. Putting employee fears to rest and training them to use and interact with this technology is a big part of the responsibility of the leaders. Introducing new tech is not enough when employees are not sure how to make the most of it.

Effectively leading AI teams requires a division of responsibility between AI agents and human workers who use AI to ensure that their skills are best optimized. Apart from the delegation of work, there is also the question of ethics that often comes up when using AI. Navigating these challenges falls to leaders, and it’s up to these management teams to choose a course of action that benefits both the organization and its employees and customers.

Growing Calls for AI-Powered Leadership Also Threaten Leadership Roles

Just as organizations have grown comfortable with the conversation of AI employees, many employees have started opening themselves up to the idea of AI leaders. Many believe that AI leaders may be fairer and apolitical about making decisions regarding their careers, but there are also some reservations about allowing AI to handle matters that require empathy. We haven’t yet reached a point where AI CEOs run organizations instead of actual leaders, but that future may not be a distant one.

Even with such changes on the horizon, it’s hard to believe that real leaders are going anywhere. AI-supported leadership is certainly on the cards; however, it requires leaders to familiarize themselves with the technology as much as possible to understand its effects on the workforce. Leading AI teams and being aware of the needs based on their human-tech makeup is a growing challenge for leaders to face head-on.

The technological revolution goes beyond acquiring and investing in AI, and lands on how efficiently leaders are able to prepare for its real effect on the organization as a whole.",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leading-AI-teams.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:03.381602

The company has been promoting access without a prescription in the state as recently as last week, when the democratic governors of Oregon, Washington and California announced a “West Coast Health Alliance” aimed at safeguarding access to vaccines.

The state Board of Pharmacy on Friday said it would have more clarity for vaccine access rules after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meets on Sept. 18-19. That’s the first meeting since the FDA issued more restrictive annual guidance in August which limited the vaccine to people aged 65 or older or those with an underlying health condition that would risk severe illness.

Thibault did not respond to follow-up questions about the restrictions Friday, when the Capital Chronicle reported Gov. Tina Kotek is weighing a variety of options to safeguard COVID vaccine access at pharmacies. One option could be a standing order guaranteeing the vaccine to individuals age 6 months or older, similar to one issued in Washington.

But in a statement Tuesday morning, Thibault said the company was shifting course.

“After reviewing clarifying guidance issued last week, we’re only offering updated COVID-19 vaccinations to patients who present a prescription from an authorized prescriber,” she said in a statement. “As a result, appointments cannot currently be scheduled online in Oregon. Patients can walk in to any CVS Pharmacy location, present a prescription and receive the vaccination.”

The new regulations from CVS bring it in line with guidance that has frustrated patients across the state. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy stressed Friday that it would require prescriptions for approval and await more information from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, of which U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy removed all members in June. Kennedy is considering appointing critics of COVID-19 vaccines to the panel, the Washington Post reported Monday.

Pediatrician and state Sen. Lisa Reynolds, D-Portland, urged the state to adopt a standing order and questioned the value of waiting till mid-September for the federal government.

“Waiting until the ACIP meeting (Sept 18-19) will cause unnecessary delays,” she wrote in a statement. “And don’t we expect the ACIP recommendations to mirror the FDA approval?”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1254511513-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:22.307587
