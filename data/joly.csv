In addition, Microsoft has increased its focus on selling its cloud customers Anthropic AI models, which could drive more revenue for both firms.

The company recently informed salespeople in its Azure cloud business that selling Anthropic AI models to Microsoft cloud customers will count toward their sales goals just like Microsoft-made software, two Microsoft employees told The Information.

Because Microsoft has offered the same incentive for sales staff for selling OpenAI products, the new quota system means sales people have as much incentive to sell Anthropic models as ones from its main competitor, the sources said.

As the report noted, Microsoft’s increasing ties to Anthropic follow its decision in September to make an up-to-$5 billion investment in the company. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, giving it a 27% stake in the startup.

But while Microsoft keeps 80% of sales of OpenAI models to Azure customers, it retains a smaller percentage of its sales of Anthropic’s AI models, a source briefed on the situation told The Information.

OpenAI announced in October that it had transformed its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation, an arrangement that provides Microsoft with a 27% stake — worth roughly $135 billion — in that unit.

“What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry,” the ChatGPT maker wrote on its blog at the time.

In other Microsoft news, PYMNTS wrote this week about the company’s new agentic AI capabilities, which it says are designed to help retailers move faster, operate with greater efficiency and engage shoppers with more relevance by enhancing human decision-making.

“The approach focuses on connecting traditionally fragmented functions — merchandising, marketing, store operations and fulfillment — into coordinated workflows that can anticipate needs and act in real time,” the report added.

Microsoft said this shift reflects a wider move within the industry toward intelligence-driven retail operating models created for speed, resilience and scale.

As PYMNTS wrote, it shows how the company is pushing AI “deeper into retail operations, positioning intelligent automation as a unifying layer across the entire retail value chain.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Microsoft-.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:59:55.000414

The Paris Stock Exchange moved within a narrow range on Wednesday, ending slightly in negative territory at 8,330.97 points, down by 0.19%. The session unfolded in a typically cautious atmosphere, with no major news to guide the markets and trading volumes particularly low. This lethargy is part of an uncertain start to the year 2026, as investors remain cautious following the end-of-year movements in 2025.

The Paris market lacked clear direction throughout the day. With 21 stocks rising, 17 falling, and 2 stable out of the 40 components of the index, the varied performances illustrate the absence of a dominant trend. Traders favored a cautious approach, awaiting more concrete elements likely to set a course for the markets. This phase of hesitation reflects a climate where sectoral arbitration prevails over a broader dynamic, with investors remaining cautious in mid-January.

Orange and Sanofi boost defensive stocks, while tech stocks fall

Telecom and healthcare sectors managed to stand out in this lackluster session. Orange took the top spot on the leaderboard with a gain of 2.83% at 14.54 euros, closely followed by Sanofi, which rose by 2.55% to 82.55 euros. Air Liquide rounded out this leading trio with an increase of 2.28% to 161.56 euros. These three defensive stocks, known for their stability and dividends, benefited from sector rotation in an uncertain environment. Bouygues (+1.55% to 45.27 euros) and Société Générale (+1.46% to 70.7 euros) were also among the day's top performers.

In contrast, technology and industrial stocks suffered. Schneider Electric dropped 3.12% to 231 euros, recording the largest decline on the Paris market. STMicroelectronics fell by 2.43% to 24.13 euros, hit like the entire semiconductor sector. Aerospace leaders also slid, with Airbus down 2.16% to 215.45 euros and Safran decreasing by 1.72% to 320.2 euros. Accor lost 2.15% to 45.99 euros. These declines in cyclical and technology stocks contrast with the resilience of defensive stocks, reflecting a cautious repositioning of portfolios.

Europe in Sync, Wall Street Searching for Direction

Other European markets experienced a similar climate of indecision this Wednesday. The Paris stock exchange ended the session on a neutral note, perfectly illustrating the sluggish start to the year 2026. Without any immediate catalysts and with skeletal trading volumes, the CAC 40 drifted with sector rotations, as investors favored caution in mid-January. The Paris market remains in a phase of observation, waiting for more tangible elements to regain conviction.

It’s called “surveillance pricing,” when companies set different prices for different customers.
“But to me that’s problematic.” No one really knows how common surveillance pricing is.
In a statement, the retailer said: Because prices can vary by market, customers may occasionally see slight differences as price matches and changes are executed in real time.
All this to say, personalized pricing or not, there’s some kind of algorithmic something happening here.","My husband, John, and I decided to try a little experiment the other day. We’d just finished shopping at a supermarket in Queens and wondered: How much would an Uber cost to get home?

We each typed in our address and on the count of three, confirmed the ride. John’s price was $8.91. I was given $9.96.

“I don’t really use Uber, so maybe it’s trying to get me to use it more?” guessed John.

That’s one theory. But the company said it does not personalize fares. In a statement, Uber said variations in prices reflect things like how many drivers are active and how many customers are requesting similar trips.

In general though, companies now know more than ever about our habits. That’s powerful information — not just for advertising, but to understand how much any given person might pay for something beyond the realities of dynamic pricing. It’s called “surveillance pricing,” when companies set different prices for different customers. After much backlash, Instacart recently ended a pilot that allowed retailers to charge different prices for people living in the same city.

Personalized pricing isn’t new. In fact, it’s been around in some form as long as commerce has.

“People think that personalization is a 21st-century phenomenon due to the internet. It goes back to peddlers and before,” said Joseph Turow, author of “The Voice Catchers: How Marketers Listen In to Exploit Your Emotions, Your Privacy, and Your Wallet.”

Shopkeepers would game out what customers were willing to pay.

“They would actually keep notebooks on the people they spoke to and would write down specific characteristics,” like what kind of clothes you wore or who your friends and family were, said Turow.

The difference is before, a business owner had to guess if a woman’s baby bump was indeed a baby bump. Now, a retailer knows the instant she adds prenatal vitamins to her cart.

“It’s legal to do it, and some economists would say that price differentiation is just part of the way that economics works,” said Turow, adding that a lot of consumers have no idea surveillance pricing is happening. “But to me that’s problematic.”

No one really knows how common surveillance pricing is. But what is clear is that retailers are watching us closely.

“Behavior patterns, their browsing history, their loyalty that they might have, whether it’s through credit card or through points,” said Shikha Jain, a retail partner at the consulting company Simon Kucher. “And so you do see that happening more and more.”

Often retailers are using that information not for surveillance pricing, but surveillance discounting: Here’s a coupon for being a member or 10% off that immersion blender sitting in your cart. It’s why, as a consumer, it’s more difficult than ever to figure out if you’re getting the best price.

“Price discrimination sounds really scary, but effectively it means that it’s good for some consumers and not so good for others,” said Garrett Johnson, a marketing professor at Boston University.

If you want to compare prices, said Johnson, you kind of need to hide.

“So you can open the website in incognito mode, using your mobile phone, you know, maybe even turn off your wifi,” he said.

But are we really going to do this dance every time we buy something as mundane as toothpaste?

I decided to shop for toothpaste at Walmart online, on two different browsers. On one, I signed into my account, which had my information. On the other, I was anonymous, but added my shipping address for an exact location comparison.

I scrolled through the search results and saw a few price discrepancies, including a tube of Colgate toothpaste. On both searches, I was given the same type, same cool mint flavor and same 6.3 oz. size — at different prices. On the page where I was not signed into my account, the tube was $3.74. On the page where I was signed in, it was $3.96.

I reached out to Walmart about their pricing policy. In a statement, the retailer said: Because prices can vary by market, customers may occasionally see slight differences as price matches and changes are executed in real time.

All this to say, personalized pricing or not, there’s some kind of algorithmic something happening here. Turns out, companies know a lot about us. But we don’t know so much about them — or how they decide what we pay.",https://img.apmcdn.org/c636483cda7e13feee83cb261935645de7b2bf43/widescreen/b3dc9c-20260113-a-shopping-cart-with-cereal-coffee-and-tissues-2000.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:02:45.269802

OpenAI is in an early phase of another massive funding round that could value the company at 830 billion dollars before the new investment.","OpenAI has reached a multi-year agreement with chip startup Cerebras Systems that provides for the deployment of 750 megawatts of computing power based on Cerebras systems. The partnership is valued at over ten billion dollars and extends over three years, with implementation scheduled in multiple phases through 2028. This deployment will roll out in multiple stages beginning in 2026.

According to both companies, the agreement marks the world’s largest deployment of high-speed AI inference. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is personally involved as an investor in Cerebras, and the two companies have been holding regular discussions about a possible collaboration since 2017.

Inference is not about training new AI models, but about running existing ones – that is, when users send requests via ChatGPT and these should be answered as quickly and well as possible.

Speed as a Competitive Advantage

Cerebras develops AI processors at wafer scale that, according to the company, generate answers significantly faster than GPU-based systems. The technology integrates massive computing capacity, memory, and bandwidth on a single large-format chip, thereby eliminating bottlenecks in conventional hardware.

For applications such as coding agents or language chats, large language models on Cerebras systems deliver results up to 15 times faster than on comparable GPU platforms. This speed fundamentally transforms the user experience and enables real-time interactions that promote longer engagement times and more productive workflows.

OpenAI faces significant challenges in procuring sufficient computing capacity. The company has more than 900 million weekly users and has repeatedly pointed to a severe shortage of computing resources.

The integration of Cerebras technology is targeted specifically for workloads where low latency is critical. An infrastructure executive at OpenAI explained that the company’s compute strategy aims to optimally align different systems with specific tasks. Negotiations between the two companies began in the fall and led to the signing of a term sheet by Thanksgiving. Generally, they know each other well; since 2017 there have been regular meetings between the two companies.

Financial Dimension and Market Context

According to information from company circles, Cerebras is in discussions about a funding round of one billion dollars that would value the company at 22 billion dollars – nearly a tripling compared to the previous valuation. The startup, founded about ten years ago, has faced challenges in the past:

In preparation for an IPO in 2024, the company disclosed that the majority of its revenue came from a single customer, G42, based in Abu Dhabi. Cerebras withdrew the planned IPO and instead raised 1.1 billion dollars privately, which corresponded to a valuation of 8.1 billion dollars. In the meantime, the company has concluded new agreements with IBM and Meta, thereby diversifying its customer base – now also with OpenAI.

OpenAI is pursuing a broad-based chip strategy to break free from the dominance of individual suppliers. The company is developing a custom chip jointly with Broadcom and has signed an agreement for the use of AMD’s new MI450 chip. Nvidia, the leading provider of AI chips, had reached a preliminary agreement with OpenAI in September for the sale of up to ten gigawatts of chips, which has not yet been finalized. In parallel, Nvidia concluded a 20 billion dollar licensing agreement with inference startup Groq in December. The market for specialized inference chips is gaining momentum as AI companies seek fast and cost-efficient alternatives to conventional GPU systems.

OpenAI’s financial commitments are increasingly raising questions among investors. The company generated approximately 13 billion dollars in revenue last year, while it signed cloud contracts with Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon totaling approximately 600 billion dollars. Sam Altman emphasizes that the company will finance these commitments, staggered over several years, through future revenue growth. OpenAI is in an early phase of another massive funding round that could value the company at 830 billion dollars before the new investment. The financing is intended to prepare for a planned IPO and support the company’s extensive growth plans.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:02:49.058540

Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, arguing that interest rates should be sharply lower and suggesting Dimon’s defense of the Fed was driven by self-interest.
“We should have lower interest rates,” Trump said during remarks Tuesday, adding that Dimon “probably wants higher rates” and suggesting the JPMorgan chief executive benefits from elevated borrowing costs.
Dimon, the head of the nation’s largest bank, had warned earlier that any move that chips away at the Fed’s independence could backfire, raising inflation expectations and ultimately pushing interest rates higher.

“I think he’s wrong,” Trump said when asked about Dimon’s criticism, defending the Justice Department’s investigation and insisting his administration was not undermining the Federal Reserve, even as the probe has sparked market turmoil and drawn bipartisan backlash.

“I think it’s fine what I’m doing. And we have a bad Fed person,” the president said.

Trump doubled down on his attacks against Powell, arguing that interest rates should be sharply lower and suggesting Dimon’s defense of the Fed was driven by self-interest.

“We should have lower interest rates,” Trump said during remarks Tuesday, adding that Dimon “probably wants higher rates” and suggesting the JPMorgan chief executive benefits from elevated borrowing costs.

Dimon, the head of the nation’s largest bank, had warned earlier that any move that chips away at the Fed’s independence could backfire, raising inflation expectations and ultimately pushing interest rates higher.

“Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,” Dimon told reporters Tuesday.

“Anything that chips away at that is probably not a good idea. In my view, it will have the reverse consequences. It will probably raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time.”

Trump also said he would press ahead with plans to name Powell’s replacement within weeks, despite the backlash to the probe from Wall Street executives and Republican lawmakers.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who sits on the powerful Senate Banking Committee, has vowed to block any new Federal Reserve nominees until the investigation is resolved.

Other executives echoed Dimon’s concerns, warning that threatening the Fed’s autonomy could rattle bond markets and undermine confidence, with Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince cautioning that political pressure on the central bank risks pushing interest rates higher rather than lower.

“Independent central banks with the ability to independently set monetary policy in the long-term interests of the nation is a pretty well-established thing that we’ve seen all around the world over a very long period of time,” Vince told reporters Tuesday.

“Let’s not shake the foundation of the bond market ⁠and potentially do something that could cause interest rates to actually get pushed up because somehow there’s ‍lack of confidence in the Fed’s independence.”

Other Wall Street big shots echoed the sentiment.

“The attempt to kill the Fed’s independence by criminal investigation is not good for that institution, and maybe even worse for the Justice Department,” former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote on X.

“Feels like an attempt at murder-suicide.”

The Justice Department investigation centers on Powell’s June testimony to Congress about the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation of its Washington headquarters, including whether he misled lawmakers about the project’s scope and cost.

Prosecutors have reviewed Powell’s public statements and internal Fed spending records after Republicans accused him of downplaying luxury features that appeared in earlier planning documents.

Powell has forcefully rejected the allegations, confirming that the Fed was served with grand jury subpoenas and calling the probe “unprecedented.”

He has said the renovation is funded entirely by the central bank, not taxpayers, and warned the investigation threatens the Fed’s ability to set interest rates free from political pressure.

Trump, who nominated Powell during his first term, has defended the probe as a matter of accountability, accusing the Fed chair of incompetence and insisting the investigation has nothing to do with monetary policy.

According to the filing, compounding pharmacies play a vital role by providing patient-specific medications when commercially manufactured products are unavailable, unsuitable, or in shortage. Strive argues that limiting access to compounded GLP-1s reduces competition and hinders clinical decision-making between providers and patients.

“For us, this is more than just a business dispute; it’s a fight for the right of every patient to have access to the medicine their doctor prescribes,” said Nate Hill, co-founder and CEO of Strive Compounding Pharmacy, in a statement.

Summary

Eli Lilly (LLY) is downgraded to Sell due to overstretched valuation and intensifying competition in the weight-loss drug market.

LLY's heavy reliance on high-margin US sales from Zepbound and Mounjaro exposes it to pricing and market-share risks, especially as competitors cut prices.

The upcoming launch of orforglipron faces challenges from Novo Nordisk's aggressive pricing and first-mover advantage in oral weight-loss treatments.

LLY's valuation metrics are priced to perfection, with a P/E of 48.99 and FCF yield of 0.9%, making downside risk significant if growth falters.

Introduction

A lot has happened since I rated Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) a Hold back in early August, as it appreciated by nearly 42% and reached a $1T market cap, the first in the pharmaceutical industry. With

As a detail-oriented investor with a strong foundation in finance and business writing, I focus on analyzing undervalued and disliked companies or industries that have strong fundamentals and good cash flows. I have a particular interest in sectors such as Oil&Gas and consumer goods. Basically, anything that has been unloved for unjustified reasons that could offer substantial returns. Energy Transfer is one of those companies that I came across when no one wanted to touch it and now I can't resolve myself to sell it. I will always focus more on long-term value investing but I can sometimes lose myself in possible deal arbitrage such as with Microsoft/ Activision Blizzard, Spirit Airlines/Jetblue (that one still hurts), and Nippon/U.S. Steel (perfect exit at $50.19). I tend to shun businesses that I can't understand either high-tech or certain consumer goods such as fashion (give me a Levi's jeans). I don't understand why anyone would invest in cryptocurrencies as well. Through Seeking Alpha, I aim to connect with like-minded investors, share insights, and build a collaborative community of individuals seeking superior returns and informed decision-making, currently on a quest to review every public company.

Um, I think there's some nervousness about what uh OpenAI publicly releasing some of its earnings statements would bring um for the company.
Also you had this other story where Apple decides, okay, we're going to go with Google over OpenAI for our AI features.
Um and so, you know, OpenAI had seemed poised to partner with Apple because they had that partnership.
Um and analysts sort of speculate that that put Apple on edge and pushed them towards going with Google.","Well OpenAI has taken early steps to go public. That's according to the New York Times. Potentially joining other high-valued startups like Anthropic and SpaceX to make 2026 a mega year for IPOs. Here with more, our very own Laura Brad. So Laura, uh Sam Altman has said he is 0%, 0% excited about leading a public company. What do you make of that?

Yeah. Um, I think there's some nervousness about what uh OpenAI publicly releasing some of its earnings statements would bring um for the company. But OpenAI needs to raise capital. It needs money. Um it's committed to about 1.4 trillion worth of commitments over the next eight years. And at the same time, its revenue uh reported by The Information and The Times was just about 13 billion. So there's really a gap that it needs to fill. Um and going public could could help sort of like narrow the the gap. In in December, they were in talks for a private funding round um valued at about 750 billion, putting putting the company at a 750 billion valuation. Um and the New York Times report said that OpenAI would be valued at 500 billion, so I'd be curious to see what that valuation ends up coming in at.

Also you had this other story where Apple decides, okay, we're going to go with Google over OpenAI for our AI features. What do you make of that?

Yeah, so, um, you know, with the release of Gemini 3, that really put OpenAI on edge. Sam Altman declared a code red, um, and that made news. Um and so, you know, OpenAI had seemed poised to partner with Apple because they had that partnership. Apple rolled out ChatGPT on iPhones in 2024. Um but then OpenAI appeared to take a swing at Apple by um, you know, merging with the startup of its former chief designer, Johnny Ive, and they're trying to

Sir Johnny Ive. Yes.

Yes, Sir Johnny Ive. Yes. And they're trying to release a consumer hardware device. Um and analysts sort of speculate that that put Apple on edge and pushed them towards going with Google. They also have the benefit of, you know, leveraging Google's infrastructure. Google has TPUs or AI chips. Um they have the cloud. And so, um, you know, OpenAI is really losing out on distribution here. Um you know, it's going to be big for Google to have that brand visibility being on every iPhone in the world.

So plenty of competition. What's what's a win for OpenAI in the year ahead?

Yeah, there there's a lot that OpenAI could win. Um there's a lot of concern in the market about OpenAI succeeding, whether it will succeed or not. Um they really need to find a business model that will work right now. OpenAI is essentially subsidizing users and at some point they're going to need to generate revenue, whether that's, you know, figuring out the ad format that's going to work for them to generate ad revenue or pushing further into the enterprise space. That's really something that Anthropic has gone super heavily into. Um and, you know, they need to release new models that are on the cutting edge that can rival Google and, you know, so as not to get displaced by Google. Um and then the last thing I'll say is that they they really need to secure enough power for their data centers because that's a concern that there's not going to be enough power in the market uh for these data centers and then, you know, that's going to have ripple effects across the entire market because um OpenAI's growth is uh really important for companies like Oracle and CoreWeave. OpenAI has deals across the ecosystem. So it's really important for OpenAI to meet its goals.

All right, Laura, thank you. As always appreciate it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pxOF2XcbVfKGosENiWPeqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/45ed3c60-f192-11f0-9d5d-db4ea2bbbdd4,N,,2026-01-14 21:02:07.511853

Cerebras builds purpose-built AI systems to accelerate long-form outputs from AI models.
KEY QUOTES: “OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads.
That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.” Sachin Katti, OpenAI “We are delighted to partner with OpenAI, bringing the world’s leading AI models to the world’s fastest AI processor.
Just as broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI, enabling entirely new ways to build and interact with AI models.”","OpenAI has partnered with Cerebras to add 750 megawatts of ultra-low-latency AI compute to OpenAI’s platform, expanding the company’s inference capacity with systems designed to deliver faster, more responsive model outputs. Multiple reports cited that the deal is valued at over $10 billion.

Cerebras builds purpose-built AI systems to accelerate long-form outputs from AI models. The company’s approach centers on placing large amounts of compute, memory, and bandwidth onto a single, giant chip to reduce the bottlenecks that can slow inference on conventional hardware.

OpenAI said the integration is intended to improve real-time performance across its products by shortening the request-response loop behind complex tasks such as answering difficult questions, generating code, creating images, and running AI agents. The company argues that faster, more natural response times can increase engagement and support higher-value workloads.

According to OpenAI, the Cerebras capacity will be integrated into its inference stack in phases and expanded across workloads over time. The additional compute is expected to come online in multiple tranches through 2028.

The partnership aligns with OpenAI’s broader compute strategy of maintaining a portfolio of systems matched to specific workload needs, with Cerebras positioned as a dedicated option for low-latency inference.

KEY QUOTES:

“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads. Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”

The arrangement is worth over $10 billion, according to people close to the company.

The deal will help diversify Cerebras away from the United Arab Emirates' G42, which accounted for 87% of revenue in the first half of 2024.

Cerebras has built a large processor that can train and run generative artificial intelligence models. That makes it a challenger to Nvidia , which sells large quantities of its chips to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft — those companies then rent the graphics cards to clients by the hour. Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization in October, as investors sought to capitalize on further AI growth.

In December, Cerebras rival Groq said Nvidia had signed a non-exclusive licensing agreement that would result in some employees moving to Nvidia. Groq's cloud service is not part of the deal, which CNBC reported is worth $20 billion in cash, making it Nvidia's largest transaction to date.

""Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform,"" Sachin Katti, who works on compute infrastructure at OpenAI, wrote in the blog. ""That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.""

The deal comes months after OpenAI worked with Cerebras to ensure that its gpt-oss open-weight models would work smoothly on Cerebras silicon, alongside chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .

Cerebras filed for an initial public offering in September 2024, revealing that revenue in the second quarter of that year approached $70 million, up from about $6 million in the second quarter of 2023. The company's net loss swelled to almost $51 million, from $26 million a year earlier.

Investment banks that typically participate in the top technology IPOs were missing from the prospectus, and the company used an auditor other than the so-called Big Four accounting firms.

Cerebras withdrew the paperwork in October, days after announcing a $1.1 billion round of funding that valued it at $8.1 billion. The company said it pulled the prospectus because details were out of date.

""Given that the business has improved in meaningful ways we decided to withdraw so that we can re-file with updated financials, strategy information including our approach to the rapidly changing AI landscape,"" Cerebras' co-founder and CEO Andrew Feldman wrote in a LinkedIn post. A revised filing will provide a better explanation of the business to potential investors, he wrote.

Cerebras' customer list includes Cognition, Hugging Face, IBM and Nasdaq, and in March 2025, the company said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had approved Cerebras' request to sell shares to G42.

What's the story

Ammobia, a start-up, is significantly improving the production of ammonia, a key ingredient in fertilizers and other industries. The company has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process, which has been used for over a century to produce ammonia. Ammobia's innovation could cut production costs by as much as 40%.

Industrial applications

Ammonia's potential beyond fertilizers

Ammonia is being explored as a possible alternative to hydrogen for decarbonizing various industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have even drawn up industrial and transportation plans centered around ammonia. ""The big advantage of ammonia is that it's much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,"" said Karen Baert, co-founder and CEO of Ammobia.

Pollution concerns

Ammonia production's environmental impact

The Haber-Bosch process, while effective, is also a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. It accounts for nearly 2% of the world's total greenhouse gases. The traditional method uses an iron catalyst to combine nitrogen and hydrogen under high heat (500 degree Celsius) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi), both typically provided by burning fossil fuels. This makes ammonia production a significant source of pollution globally.

Innovative approach

Ammobia's process: A cleaner alternative

Ammobia's process operates at a much lower temperature and pressure, resulting in less pollution even if fossil fuels are still used. The start-up also claims its method is cheaper as it can use less expensive pumps and equipment due to the lower temperature and pressure requirements. This could give producers an edge since most ammonia producers have only two ways to cut costs: find a cheaper heat source or hydrogen source.

Compatibility with renewable energy

Ammobia's process is compatible with any hydrogen or heat source, including renewables. The start-up says its technology works best when there's excess electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia. ""Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don't need to store hydrogen or store electricity,"" Baert said.

Expansion strategy

Ammobia's commercial-scale unit and future plans

Ammobia's commercial-scale unit will generate 250 tons of ammonia per day, much smaller than the typical Haber-Bosch plant which produces between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day. The company has been running a small unit for about a year now. The new funding will help build a pilot plant with all features of the commercial model on a smaller scale (about 10 tons per day).

Amy Duong — January 14, 2026 — Lifestyle

The Heinz Dipper fry box is a patent-pending package that integrates a dedicated compartment for ketchup or other condiments into the fries container. The format keeps the sauce separated from the fries until use and removes the need for separate dip cups or packets. Heinz developed the concept as a packaging update to its familiar fry box shape. The design is presented in versions tailored to different condiment preferences, including ketchup and mayonnaise.

Heinz is rolling out the packaging through participating restaurants and sports stadiums across eleven countries. The launch spans select locations in the United States and additional markets, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Philippines, Thailand, China, and Kuwait. The release is supported by a global campaign developed with the agency Rethink and is available while supplies last.

TMDX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in Organ Care System (“OCS”) technology. The optimism, led by solid third-quarter 2025 results, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns due to gross margin pressure persist.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 22.1% in the last six-month period compared with 11.1% growth of the industry. The S&P 500 has witnessed 14.3% growth in the said time frame.

The renowned organ transplant therapy provider has a market capitalization of $4.6 billion. TransMedics’ earnings yield of 2.01% compares favorably with the industry’s 0.61%. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 79.25%.

Factors Favoring TMDX’s Growth

Robust Pipeline Supporting Growth: TransMedics’ third-quarter update underscored meaningful momentum across its clinical pipeline, with next-generation ENHANCE Heart and DENOVO Lung trials set to begin enrolling and generating initial revenues in fourth-quarter 2025 under conditional IDE approvals. Management expects full FDA clearance by early 2026, positioning these studies to accelerate OCS Heart and Lung adoption as they demonstrate the improved performance of the Gen 2 platform.

Alongside these programs, the company advanced its OCS Kidney initiative, with strong preclinical and product development progress and a formal system reveal slated for early 2026. The upcoming kidney trial is expected to be large in scale and revenue-generating, supporting TransMedics’ entry into the biggest organ transplant category beginning in 2027.

The company also highlighted progress on its Gen 3 OCS platform and continued rollout of the NOP Connect digital ecosystem. Gen 3 development is well underway, with additional technical details expected in the second half of 2026. Meanwhile, early feedback on NOP Connect points to efficiency gains that should become more visible as centers deepen integration through 2026. Together, these pipeline and platform initiatives reinforce TransMedics’ long-term innovation strategy aimed at scaling adoption, expanding its addressable market and strengthening operational leverage.

Strength in OCS Technology Driving Adoption: TransMedics’ OCS revolutionizes organ transplantation by replacing passive cold storage with a dynamic, physiologic approach that perfuses donor organs with warm, oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood. This innovation minimizes ischemic injury, allows real-time organ assessment and significantly increases the viability of organs, especially hearts and lungs, donated after circulatory death, that would otherwise go unused.

As the only FDA-approved, portable platform offering warm perfusion for heart, lung and liver transplants, the OCS standardizes care, reduces post-transplant complications and sets a new clinical benchmark in organ preservation. This positions TransMedics as a leader in the multi-billion-dollar transplant market with limited competition.

Solid Q3 Results: TransMedics exited third-quarter 2025 with better-than-expected results. The solid top and bottom-line performances and the uptick in Transplant Logistics services revenues were encouraging. Strength in both revenue sources was also impressive. The expansion of the operating margin bodes well.

The company is preparing large-scale geographic and operational expansion, first by launching its inaugural international NOP program in Italy during the first half of 2026, supported by up to four regional hubs and eventually building a European logistics network similar to the U.S. model. TMDX has raised its aviation capacity to 22 aircraft and plans to pilot “double-shifting” the fleet to improve asset utilization and margins. Management is also finalizing a new global headquarters and manufacturing campus in Somerville to consolidate operations and support future scaling.

A Factor That Can Offset the Gains for TMDX

Gross Margin Under Pressure: TransMedics’ third-quarter 2025 gross margin came in at roughly 59%, down about 260 basis points sequentially, reflecting typical seasonal transplant softness, lower system utilization and ongoing infrastructure investments that weighed on cost absorption despite healthy year-over-year improvement. Logistics continued to be a major revenue contributor but remained dilutive to blended margins, with volumes also declining sequentially in line with seasonal trends.

Management expects gross margins to hover around the 60% level over the next several years, though short-term fluctuations are likely as international expansion and upfront investments persist. While these pressures should ease as scale improves, the company does not foresee meaningful margin expansion in the near term, leaving the margin profile stable but constrained even alongside strong revenue growth and operating leverage.

Estimate Trend

TransMedics is witnessing a stable estimate revision trend for 2025. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has remained stable at $2.61 per share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $155.9 million, indicating a 28.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

In 2025, FAN Courier paid 290 million euros in taxes to the Romanian state, according to CEO Adrian Mihai.
Even so, we estimate that the courier market grew by more than 10% compared to 2024,” said Adrian Mihai, CEO and co-founder of FAN Courier.
In 2025, FAN Courier reached nearly 9,500 employees across its entire network, including 300 non-EU workers.
Currently, 2,700 FANbox lockers are operational, with another 400 already purchased and in the process of installation.","FAN Courier ended 2025 with a turnover of RON 1.54 billion (approximately 310 million euros), up around 11 percent compared to the previous year. For 2026, the company forecasts a further increase of about 15 percent in revenues.

However, profitability declined by roughly 40 percent last year, mainly due to rising fuel and salary costs. In 2025, FAN Courier paid 290 million euros in taxes to the Romanian state, according to CEO Adrian Mihai.

Parcel volumes continued to grow steadily, with a 15% increase in 2025 compared to 2024, driven by the rapid expansion of e-commerce, the growth of online stores, and rising consumer interest in online shopping due to convenience, wider product selection, and fast deliveries.

Total investments in 2025 reached approximately €40 million, focused mainly on the locker network, technology and IT, fleet modernization and expansion, and logistics infrastructure development.

Half of the investment budget (around €20 million) was allocated to the expansion of the FANbox locker network, one of the company’s most important strategic projects in recent years.

Around €12 million was invested in the development and digitalization of regional hubs and warehouses, including modernizations in Dumbrăvița (Timiș County), Ineu (Arad County), the Bacău hub, and FAN Courier’s Action headquarters in Bucharest. A further €5.7 million went into fleet development, while more than €2 million was invested in digitalization.

Another major investment project was the installation of a new state-of-the-art sorting system designed to optimize last-mile delivery services and improve operational efficiency. The new Vanderlande system has a sorting capacity of 30,000 parcels per hour and is connected via a dedicated tunnel to the existing infrastructure. The project, developed in two phases, involves a total investment of approximately €14 million.

“2025 was a year of expansion for the courier industry, especially in the B2C and e-commerce segments, despite a difficult economic and political environment marked by tax increases and fiscal uncertainty. Investments by international marketplaces in Romania directly supported market growth by attracting new users and stimulating demand. At the same time, fiscal changes significantly affected consumer behavior, with lower shipment volumes among some local merchants. Even so, we estimate that the courier market grew by more than 10% compared to 2024,” said Adrian Mihai, CEO and co-founder of FAN Courier.

In 2025, FAN Courier reached nearly 9,500 employees across its entire network, including 300 non-EU workers. The company will continue to recruit internationally in 2026 due to the shortage of blue-collar labor on the domestic market, the high productivity and discipline of foreign workers, and the need to better manage peak periods.

Last year, FAN Courier’s courier fleet (pick-up & delivery) grew by 10%, while the linehaul component expanded through both in-house and subcontracted routes.

“For us, 2025 was a good year, and we achieved the main business objectives set at the beginning of the year. The main challenge was cost pressure. Supplier price increases are difficult to fully pass on to customers, so we absorbed a significant part of these costs while remaining competitive through internal process improvements. Although this puts pressure on profitability, it creates opportunities to strengthen customer relationships and continue investing in efficiency, technology, and quality, which are essential for long-term development,” added Neculai Mihai, co-founder of FAN Courier.

One of the most important strategic projects remains the expansion of the FANbox locker network, which accelerated in 2025 due to growing customer demand. The share of deliveries via FANbox doubled year-on-year, and for 2026 the company estimates that 25% of all deliveries will be made through lockers — one of the most visible shifts in customer behavior toward out-of-home delivery solutions.

“Locker delivery has been on an upward trend for several years, which is why expanding the FANbox network remains one of our major projects. Currently, 2,700 FANbox lockers are operational, with another 400 already purchased and in the process of installation. At the same time, we are preparing the acquisition of a new batch of around 1,000 lockers, bringing total investment in this area close to €40 million since the project began. Our goal for 2026 is to exceed 4,000 lockers, with at least 25% of deliveries made through lockers,” said Felix Pătrășcanu, co-founder of FAN Courier.",https://www.thediplomat.ro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thed_diplomat_ico2.fw_.png,N,,2026-01-14 14:05:30.039186

Fashion has a habit of building legend, and in the modern era, few brands are more revered by menswear fanatics than Double RL, often styled as RRL.

Originally born out of Ralph Lauren’s fascination with westernwear (the line is named after the designer’s expansive Colorado ranch), the offshoot of Lauren’s eponymous brand marked a significant divergence from the traditional tailored prep of the main line when it debuted in 1993.

Go West, Young Man, But Not Too Far: How to Pull Off Westernwear

Incorporate pearl snaps and Western boots into your own wardrobe without going full Marlboro Man

Whereas classic Ralph Lauren — and subsequently, Polo — stick to clean-cut staples, RRL commits to a rougher frontier aesthetic, with a focus on heritage craft and a notably higher price point. This trifecta is perhaps best encapsulated by the brand’s best-selling selvedge denim, which routinely sells out despite sticker prices as high as $500 a pair.

Offering sportswear in its truest sense — not athleisure, but built-for-life garments, with silhouettes rooted in classic workwear and inspired by (or yanked directly from) the American Southwest — and guided by guru-like fashion figures, RRL has garnered near-mythical status over the past 30-plus years.

While RRL’s success is due in no small part to menswear’s increasing fascination with Americana and a hard-earned reputation for quality among fashion diehards, it’s the brand’s decades-long commitment to a steadfast westernwear aesthetic that’s established it as a cult presence in menswear, and a highly coveted label in the secondhand market, where tattered RRL flannels and officer’s chinos can fetch thousands.

This signature apparel — leather outerwear, hearty twill workshirts, needlecord trousers and ’20s-era three-piece suiting — is regularly showcased in RRL’s seasonal catalogs, which, much like the clothing itself, has become something of a collector’s item. Designed in the spirit of classic mail-order catalogs, the biannual releases blend evocative imagery, old-timey iconography and rugged product layflats to an impressively vintage effect.

The latest RRL catalog, celebrating the Spring 2026 collection, is a particular standout in this coveted lineup. Shot with a tintype-esque grain and presented in stark black and white, the just-released imagery showcases RRL’s latest batch of crispy suede jackets and oversized ten-gallon hats on brooding cowboys who lean on trucks and wander in desert expanses.

While many of the brand’s styles remain consistent season after season — the sturdy Checked Wool Twill Workshirt is a one of RRL’s hallmark offerings — Spring 2026 introduces a number of welcome surprises: the Officer’s Pant, a longtime staple, has been reworked in a slick diamond-print moleskin, while the new Fleece-Paneled Canvas Jacket promises a (potentially stiff) mixed-media outerwear experience like no other.

It’s no coincidence that the RRL Spring 2026 catalog serves as both a genuflection to the robust workwear of the past and a moodboard for any macho man ready to get his Wild West cosplay on. That’s exactly what RRL fanatics demand, and, to their benefit, what the brand has consistently delivered for the past three decades.

BAX recently announced the upcoming U.S. launch of its Dynamo Series smart stretcher, expanding its portfolio of connected care solutions for hospital settings. The new stretcher is designed to support care teams in high-pressure environments while improving patient safety, comfort, and overall workflow efficiency.

The launch highlights Baxter’s continued focus on practical innovation in acute care, particularly in areas like emergency departments and perioperative settings. For investors, the Dynamo Series underscores Baxter’s strategy to strengthen its Care & Connectivity segment through differentiated, technology-enabled products that address real clinical pain points.

Likely Trend of BAX Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, the company's shares traded flat in yesterday’s after-market session. In the last six-month period, shares have lost 31.1% compared with the industry’s 7.2% decline. The S&P 500 has risen 14.4% over the same period.

Over the long run, the Dynamo Series could strengthen BAX’s growth by deepening its presence in high-use hospital settings and reinforcing its value proposition around connected, workflow-enhancing care solutions. By helping hospitals reduce patient transfers, improve safety and ease staff workload, the stretcher increases switching costs. It supports broader adoption of Baxter’s smart bed ecosystem, which can drive recurring demand and longer customer relationships.

BAX currently has a market capitalization of $10.36 billion.

More on the Launch

The Dynamo Series is built to meaningfully improve the day-to-day experience of care teams by reducing unnecessary patient transfers, a common source of physical strain and workflow inefficiency in hospitals. With integrated stirrups and flexible positioning options, clinicians can perform a range of procedures directly in the stretcher, including obstetric and pelvic exams, limiting the need to move patients between equipment. A fully electric design with powered drive and adjustable height, head, and knee positions further simplifies patient handling, while optional wireless connectivity enables select clinical safety and patient data to flow directly into electronic medical records, supporting remote monitoring and more efficient care delivery.

Patient safety is another core focus of the Dynamo Series, particularly around fall prevention, a persistent and costly issue for hospitals. The stretcher incorporates advanced technologies such as Baxter’s SafeView+ system, which projects clear visual cues about safety status, along with a three-mode bed exit alarm that provides real-time alerts and auto-rearm functionality. Optional integration with Baxter’s Voalte Nurse Call and other hospital systems helps ensure faster staff response when risks arise.

Complementing these features, the Dynamo Series offers one of the widest care surfaces in the stretcher category, enhancing stability and comfort across patient sizes, while one-touch positioning, a true chair mode, and built-in USB charging add to patient comfort and independence.

Favorable Industry Prospect for BAX

Per a report by Global Market Insights, the global smart hospital beds market was valued at $523.7 million in 2024. The market is expected to reach from $544.8 million in 2025 to $1 billion in 2034, expanding at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period.

Increasing demand for patient-centered care, integration of IoT and AI technologies and growing hospital automation drive smart hospital bed adoption.

A Recent Development by Baxter

In December 2025, BAX shared real-world data highlighting the benefits of integrating smart infusion pumps with hospital electronic medical records (EMRs). The data, developed in collaboration with the University of Texas Medical Branch, analysed more than one million IV infusions using Baxter’s Spectrum IQ large volume infusion pumps.

The findings showed that EMR integration helped reduce patient safety alerts, shortened infusion programming time and improved clinician productivity at the bedside.

In December, the UK government and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) unveiled several draft measures and consultation papers that could significantly shape the future of the sector. Specifically, on 15 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) released a revised draft of The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025, and on 16 December 2025, the FCA published three Consultation Papers on cryptoasset regulation: (1) CP25/40 Regulating Crypto Activities, (2) CP25/41 Regulating Cryptoassets: Admissions & Disclosures and Market Abuse Regime for Cryptoassets, and (3) CP25/42 A Prudential Regime for Cryptoasset Firms. Furthermore, on 8 January 2026, the FCA outlined details of its upcoming ‘gateway’, the application process for firms seeking to conduct newly regulated cryptoasset activities under the UK’s forthcoming regime.

Background

In December 2025, the FCA released three major consultation papers outlining its proposed rules for the UK’s first comprehensive conduct and prudential regimes for cryptoasset activities and markets. These consultations marked a pivotal step in shaping the UK’s approach to digital asset regulation, setting out frameworks for trading platforms, intermediaries, lending and borrowing, staking services, and decentralised finance (DeFi). The move followed HMT’s announcement just a day earlier of plans to bring cryptoassets within the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) regulatory perimeter by 2027. Furthermore, less than a month later, the FCA provided further clarity by unveiling details of its upcoming gateway, the application process for firms seeking authorisation to conduct newly regulated cryptoasset activities under the forthcoming regime. This legislative shift will subject digital asset firms to similar standards as traditional financial institutions, including transparency, consumer protection, and prudential requirements. Together, these initiatives aim to position the UK as a global leader in innovation-friendly yet robust digital asset regulation.

The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025

In April 2025, HMT published a draft statutory instrument introducing new regulated activities for cryptoassets under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This initiative aimed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptoasset markets in the UK. In December 2025 HMT provided further clarity and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 will come fully into force on 25 October 2027, although certain provisions will commence earlier to allow the FCA to issue directions, guidance, and rules in preparation for implementation.

The regulations establish new regulated activities such as operating a cryptoasset trading platform, issuing qualifying stablecoins, safeguarding cryptoassets, dealing in cryptoassets as principal or agent, arranging deals in cryptoassets, and cryptoasset staking. These activities will require FCA authorisation, subject to relevant exclusions. In addition, the regulations introduce two designated activity regimes: one governing public offers of qualifying cryptoassets and admissions to trading on qualifying cryptoasset platforms, and another addressing market abuse, including insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. The framework also sets out disclosure requirements, liability for misleading statements, withdrawal rights for purchasers, and obligations for firms to maintain systems and controls to prevent market abuse.

CP25/40 Regulating Cryptoasset Activities

Key proposals include:

Cryptoasset Trading Platforms (CATPs): Firms operating CATPs in the UK or serving UK consumers must obtain FCA authorisation. CATPs must implement fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory rules for platform access and order execution, with robust systems to prevent market abuse. Retail investors can only trade cryptoassets admitted to trading on authorised CATPs with approved disclosure documents.

Cryptoasset Intermediaries: Firms dealing or arranging deals in qualifying cryptoassets must be authorised and comply with best execution, transparency, and conflict of interest rules. Retail client orders must be executed on UK-authorised venues, ensuring higher consumer safeguards.

Lending and Borrowing (L&B): FCA proposes allowing retail access to regulated cryptoasset lending and borrowing services with enhanced protections, including express prior consent, prohibition on proprietary tokens, mandatory over-collateralisation, and negative balance protection to limit consumer losses.

Staking: Firms arranging cryptoasset staking must provide clear information and obtain express prior consent from retail clients. They must maintain records and comply with operational resilience and prudential requirements.

DeFi approach: Where a controlling person exists, DeFi activities will be subject to the same regulatory requirements as centralised activities, ensuring consistent consumer protection.

CP25/41 Regulating Cryptoassets: Admissions & Disclosures and Market Abuse Regime for CryptoassetS

Admissions & Disclosures (A&D) Regime:

The A&D regime focuses on the public offering and admission to trading qualifying cryptoassets on UK-authorised CATPs. Its primary goal is to improve the quality and accessibility of information available to investors at the point of admission to trading. Under this regime, CATPs must establish and publish clear, risk-based admission criteria to assess whether admitting a cryptoasset would likely harm retail investors which requires conducting due diligence to verify disclosures and ensure that only cryptoassets meeting these standards are admitted. Central to this regime is the requirement for a Qualifying Cryptoasset Disclosure Document (QCDD), which must contain all material information necessary for investors to make informed decisions. These documents, along with any supplementary disclosure documents (SDDs) issued to update material information, must be published on CATP websites and filed with an FCA-owned central repository to ensure transparency and accessibility. The regime also includes provisions for managing conflicts of interest, withdrawal rights for investors if new material information arises, and specific rules for UK-issued qualifying stablecoins, which have a tailored disclosure framework reflecting their unique role in the market.

Market Abuse Regime for Cryptoassets (MARC):

The MARC is designed to prevent and address abusive practices such as insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation within cryptoasset markets. Recognising the unique features of cryptoassets such as decentralisation, continuous 24/7 trading, and pseudo-anonymity, MARC adapts traditional market abuse principles to this context. It applies to qualifying cryptoassets admitted or seeking admission to trading on CATPs and imposes clear prohibitions on abusive behaviours. Issuers, offerors, and CATPs have responsibilities to disclose inside information promptly and fairly, with allowances for delayed disclosure under strict conditions to protect legitimate interests. CATPs and intermediaries must implement effective systems and controls to detect, prevent, and disrupt market abuse, scaled proportionately to their size and business nature. Large CATPs, defined by revenue thresholds, have additional obligations including on-chain monitoring of blockchain activity and cross-platform information sharing to combat abuse that spans multiple venues. The regime also specifies requirements for maintaining insider lists to track individuals with access to inside information, including wallet addresses where relevant. Furthermore, certain activities, such as coin burning and crypto-stabilisation, are recognised as legitimate market practices and exempt from abuse prohibitions when conducted transparently and for legitimate purposes.

CP25/42 A Prudential Regime for Cryptoasset Firms

The proposed rules in CP25/42 build upon the proposals discussed in CP25/15 and apply to all cryptoasset firms requiring FCA authorisation, covering activities such as operating qualifying cryptoasset trading platforms, staking, arranging deals, and dealing as agent or principal in qualifying cryptoassets.

Cryptoasset firms are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital, known as the Own Funds Requirement (OFR), which is determined as the highest of three components: the Permanent Minimum Requirement (PMR), a fixed amount based on the firm’s activities; the Fixed Overhead Requirement (FOR), equal to one quarter of relevant operating expenses; and the K-factor Requirement (KFR), which addresses operational and exposure risks such as client orders, trading flow, staking, safeguarding, stablecoin issuance, counterparty default, net position risk, and concentration risk. Firms must calculate these based on their scale and activities, applying specific netting and valuation rules. Additionally, they must conduct ongoing overall risk assessments, including business model reviews, capital and liquidity planning, stress testing, recovery planning, and wind-down strategies to prevent material harm. To ensure transparency and market discipline, firms must publicly disclose prudential information at least annually, covering risk management strategies, own funds composition and requirements, threshold levels, group exposures, and, for principal dealers, detailed financial statements and encumbered assets, with disclosures presented clearly and consistently.

FCA UPDATE TO CRYPTOASSET GATEWAY

On 8 January 2026, the FCA released an update regarding the cryptoasset gateway for firms seeking approval under the forthcoming regulatory framework for cryptoasset activities. All firms, including those already registered under anti-money laundering regulations or authorised to provide payment services, will need to obtain FCA authorisation or vary existing FSMA permissions, as there will be no automatic conversion. The gateway is expected to open in September 2026 for a minimum of 28 days and will close at least 28 days before the regime goes live on 25 October 2027. Firms applying within this window will receive priority review, and if decisions are delayed, a saving provision will allow them to continue operating temporarily. Those applying late will enter a transitional regime, permitting only the run-off of existing contracts without taking on new business until full authorisation is granted.

The FCA intends to host a series of information sessions for cryptoasset firms that may fall under the new regulatory regime. These sessions will help firms and their advisors understand the regime, FCA standards and expectations, and the authorisation process. In addition, firms can request a free, optional pre-application meeting through the FCA’s pre-application support service (PASS). These meetings provide an opportunity to present the business model, discuss the authorisation process, and clarify expectations, helping firms prepare high-quality applications and potentially speed up assessments. However, PASS does not guarantee approval, and the FCA does not provide advice during these meetings. Firms are encouraged to seek independent legal or compliance advice when preparing their applications.

TIMING AND Next Steps

The consultation period for CP25/40, CP25/41, and CP25/42 is open for comments and feedback until 12 February 2026, with final rules expected to be issued in policy statements in 2026. In parallel, the FCA has confirmed that its gateway is expected to open in September 2026 for at least 28 days and close no later than 28 days before the new regime, introduced under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 which goes live on 25 October 2027.

""We're essentially having their AI agent, Gemini, partner with our AI agent to create a unified shopping journey,"" he said at the ICR Conference in Orlando.
""Imagine it like a window inside of Gemini where our shopping agent kicks in and helps you complete that purchase.""
With Gemini, Danker said, Walmart is able to link a customer's chat session with their existing Walmart profile and shopping sessions where Gemini wasn't involved.
Danker said Walmart's broad selection, low prices, and fast fulfillment help it appear more frequently in Gemini and ChatGPT's shopping recommendations.","The AI shopping war is heating up, and Walmart is positioning itself to come out on top.

The concept of letting a chatbot buy things on your behalf leapt from the hypothetical realm into reality when ChatGPT rolled out a batch of shopping experiences with major retailers in November.

Then, on Sunday, Google's AI platform Gemini announced its own commerce approach, which it developed in partnership with many of the same retailers, including the world's largest, Walmart.

While both services promise to allow customers to find products and complete transactions in a more conversational and automated way, Walmart's new head of AI, Daniel Danker, said Tuesday that the way Gemini handles transactions is more seamless than ChatGPT does.

""We're essentially having their AI agent, Gemini, partner with our AI agent to create a unified shopping journey,"" he said at the ICR Conference in Orlando. ""Imagine it like a window inside of Gemini where our shopping agent kicks in and helps you complete that purchase.""

Google said its new standards create a common language for different companies' AI agents to interact with.

With Gemini, Danker said, Walmart is able to link a customer's chat session with their existing Walmart profile and shopping sessions where Gemini wasn't involved.

""For the most part, our customers aren't just customers; they're often members. And so, they're getting great delivery fees and a great experience that's really attuned to them,"" he said, referring to the subscription service Walmart+. ""That member experience shows up directly within Gemini.""

Danker said he expects agentic shopping to help Walmart capture more sales from people who didn't set out intending to make a purchase. He said this new approach could enable an almost seamless transaction when a person enlists a chatbot to help solve a problem.

For example, if someone turned to Gemini for tips on how to remove a wine stain from a particular brand of carpet, a cleaning product could be added to their existing shopping cart for delivery in one combined shipment, he said.

Danker said working with both ChatGPT and Gemini sets Walmart up to win in AI.

It appears that chatbot-powered shopping is here to stay, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating that agentic sales could add $115 billion to US e-commerce spending by 2030.

Danker is betting that Walmart's long-standing reputation for low prices and its growing strength in delivery will give the company a significant edge with customers in AI.

""The most important currency in an agentic shopping world is actually trust and affordability,"" Danker said. ""Without trust and affordability, it's very difficult for customers to hand the wheel to someone else and expect that the right thing will happen.""

Danker said Walmart's broad selection, low prices, and fast fulfillment help it appear more frequently in Gemini and ChatGPT's shopping recommendations.

Dive Brief:

Boston Scientific has received Food and Drug Administration approval for a new pulsed field ablation catheter that is indicated for use as an adjunctive device in a type of ablation that is performed when treating persistent atrial fibrillation.

Called Farapoint, the device can deliver linear and focal lesions across complex heart anatomies in a single catheter while preserving surrounding cardiac tissue, the company said in an emailed statement Tuesday. The catheter can be combined with the company’s Faraview software module on the Opal HDx mapping system to enhance visualization of the catheter and lesion formation.

Boston Scientific said clinical data supporting the approval, in cavotricuspid isthmus ablation, demonstrated the device was safe and effective, and showed high effectiveness in preventing atrial flutter recurrence.

PFA, which delivers energy pulses to the cardiac tissue to disrupt the abnormal electrical signals that cause AFib’s irregular heartbeats, is quickly transforming treatment of the condition, and Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott have all rolled out competing systems.

Persistent AFib, which accounts for about 25% of all AFib cases according to Boston Scientific, is a rapid heartbeat that lasts for seven days or more and can lead to complications such as blood clots, stroke and heart failure.

Stifel Research analyst Rick Wise said the arrival of Farapoint, which has also obtained the CE mark in Europe, could help Boston Scientific generate greater revenues per procedure and increase or sustain its overall electrophysiology market share.

The line ablations enabled by the device are also performed in “re-do” AFib procedures, which Stifel estimated make up about 40% of all AFib ablation procedures.

“Farapoint complements Boston's market-leading, larger footprint/single-shot Farawave catheter,” Wise wrote Tuesday in a note.

In a presentation at the J.P.

Data center growth reached unprecedented scale in 2025, and demand isn’t slowing. Projections indicate the industry will more than double to an estimated $584 billion globally by 2032. This growth has catalyzed conversations around infrastructure and resource use, as utility providers struggle to keep pace with the expanded industry footprint. Part of the complexity lies in cooling, which continues to evolve along with the needs of high-performance computing. S&P Global reports that in the U.S. alone, data centers required 22% more grid power in 2025 than the year prior. Without new breakthrough technologies, this strain will only intensify. Fortunately, as we exit a year of collisions between demand and capability, we’ve entered an era of innovation poised to transform cooling from site to chip.

Last year, Ecolab launched two critical programs to anchor its integrated cooling portfolio for data centers. The wave of innovation started with 3D TRASAR™ Technology for Direct-to-Chip Liquid Cooling, built to protect data center servers by monitoring coolant health indicators in real time. Ecolab® Cooling as a Service (CaaS) followed soon after, a program designed to unlock peak cooling performance by combining on-site support and deep insights across facility and technology loops. With the CaaS program, data center customers received Ecolab’s first smart Coolant Distribution Unit (CDU) with 3D TRASAR Technology integrated directly into the system. Together, these offerings enabled Ecolab to support the entire data center cooling landscape, with insights to drive consistent performance while reducing demand on water and energy resources.

We took 3D TRASAR Technology and other solutions on the road, travelling worldwide to hear directly from our customers and other stakeholders at numerous industry events. Our global tour culminated in a showcase at SC25, the leading global conference for high-performance computing. SC25 offered a unique opportunity for Ecolab to highlight its cooling innovation alongside the latest advancements in AI and quantum computing. In our conversations with tech industry leaders at the event, two key trends emerged:

Site selection will continue to be the dominating conversation as the data center industry expands. Cooling plays a critical role, and operators need to evaluate geographic considerations early to determine the best way to manage available resources.

The rapid acceleration of AI is breaking down decades of siloed innovation and forcing the industry to rethink the connections between thermal, water and power systems. Operators and engineers can no longer look at these systems as independent entities. Instead, they require an integrated strategy to manage resources effectively.

These themes set the stage for 2026, which will be characterized by how the industry adapts to its rapid growth. As AI continues to accelerate the pace of change, one constant remains: Ecolab will continue to spark innovation and deliver integrated solutions to power a cool data center future.",https://www.ecolab.com/-/media/Ecolab/Ecolab-Home/Images/Events/Industry-Conferences/SuperCompute-Floor-Image-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 17:02:01.981129

As a direct result of the acquisition, Air Liquide will nearly double its workforce in South Korea, bringing the total number of employees in the country to approximately 900.
Having operated in South Korea for more than 30 years, Air Liquide already benefits from a solid foundation in the country.
Air Liquide has identified a highly executable investment backlog comprising nearly 20 projects secured under long-term contracts.
He also warmly welcomed the DIG Airgas teams into the Air Liquide Group.","Air Liquide has officially completed the acquisition of DIG Airgas, a major integrated industrial gas provider in South Korea, marking a landmark development in the Group’s long-term global growth strategy. This transaction represents the most significant acquisition for Air Liquide in the past decade, following its transformative purchase of Airgas in the United States ten years ago. With this latest milestone, Air Liquide significantly reinforces its presence in one of Asia’s most advanced and fast-growing industrial markets.

As a direct result of the acquisition, Air Liquide will nearly double its workforce in South Korea, bringing the total number of employees in the country to approximately 900. The combined operations are expected to generate close to €900 million in annual sales, substantially enhancing the Group’s regional scale and market reach. Having operated in South Korea for more than 30 years, Air Liquide already benefits from a solid foundation in the country. The integration of DIG Airgas builds on this legacy, allowing the Group to deepen customer relationships and expand its industrial gas offerings across key sectors of the Korean economy.

The transaction was finalized ahead of the originally planned schedule, underscoring Air Liquide’s strong execution capabilities and experience in managing complex international acquisitions. Completing the deal earlier than expected means the acquisition will begin contributing to the Group’s financial and operational performance sooner, accelerating value creation and strengthening Air Liquide’s footprint across Asia.

DIG Airgas brings to the Group a robust geographical presence across all major industrial basins in South Korea, along with a diversified customer portfolio. When combined with Air Liquide’s advanced technologies, global operational expertise, and innovation-driven solutions, the acquisition creates a powerful and complementary platform for future growth. This alignment of strengths positions the Group to capitalize on South Korea’s dynamic industrial landscape and rising demand for reliable, high-quality industrial gases.

South Korea’s industrial gas market is currently ranked as the fourth largest globally and is projected to double in size by 2035. This growth is driven by the country’s strong economic fundamentals, advanced manufacturing base, and leadership in innovation. The market plays a critical role in supporting high-growth industries such as semiconductors, clean and low-carbon energy, advanced mobility solutions, and biopharmaceuticals—sectors that are central to South Korea’s national development strategy and global competitiveness.

Beyond strategic positioning, the acquisition is expected to generate substantial financial synergies. Air Liquide has identified a highly executable investment backlog comprising nearly 20 projects secured under long-term contracts. These initiatives are projected to deliver more than €50 million in additional EBITDA by 2030. Further growth synergies will be realized through the deployment of Air Liquide’s proprietary technologies and innovative solutions across DIG Airgas’s existing infrastructure. Importantly, the transaction is expected to be net profit accretive within one year following integration.

Commenting on the completion of the deal, François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer of Air Liquide, emphasized the importance of the acquisition and the collaborative role of local stakeholders. He highlighted that the strong support of Korean authorities and Air Liquide’s proven track record in integrating acquisitions enabled the Group to close the transaction ahead of schedule. He also warmly welcomed the DIG Airgas teams into the Air Liquide Group.

According to Jackow, this highly complementary acquisition represents a pivotal moment for Air Liquide in Asia, firmly establishing the Group as a reference industrial gas player in South Korea. By increasing proximity to customers and partners, and by broadening its comprehensive range of solutions across all core business lines, Air Liquide is now better positioned to support customer growth and contribute to South Korea’s strategic ambitions in high-tech manufacturing, healthcare, clean energy, and sustainable mobility over the long term.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 12:04:23.446767
ID43,Uber,2026-01-14 15:31:07+00:00,the Guardian,My work went from air-conditioned offices to delivering food on a bike. The culture shock is significant,"Guardian staff, David Rayfield",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/14/gig-economy-food-delivery-bike-accidents-experiences,"When you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same.
The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats.
After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats.
On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.
Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods.","At first I didn’t realise I’d been punched. I’m not sure why my brain assumed a bird had flown into me, but I suppose a magpie attack was more likely than a random bloke lashing out at my ribcage, so it took a second to realise what was happening.

I was on my bike, waiting in a sidestreet for traffic to clear. The punch came from behind and by the time my mouth let fly a few expletives, the culprit was leaving. Then he caught wind of my colourful language and turned back to get in my face. He was a skinhead in a bad mood. Accusing me of being in his way, he told me I was lucky he didn’t do more damage. I paused mid-reply. This was the moment I realised he was ready to go to hell tonight, and the only thing he wanted to take with him was me.

When you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same. I’d say 80% of my deliveries are fast food – a combination of McDonald’s, KFC, Hungry Jacks and coffee. Lots of coffee. My new workplace couldn’t be more different than the grey blur of an office, surrounded by the same walls and same people week after week. The culture shock of going from comfy chairs and morning teas to trying not to get killed in traffic was significant.

After being made redundant four times in six years, months passed with hundreds of unsuccessful job applications. Bills needed to be paid. The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats. My Xbox was gathering dust so I sold it at Cash Converters and put the money towards a half-decent mountain bike.

The first thing that hits you riding is the feeling of independence. In between delivering Grey Goose vodka and KFC Zinger burgers, there’s the realisation that it’s just you out there. After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats. I signed up on my phone, they sent me a fluoro thermal bag, and off I went. I don’t have to worry about anybody making me redundant because there is no anybody – there’s just me. If I want to spend hours in the park eating lunch, I will. Need more sleep? That’s between me and my doona. Granted, my wages are much lower, but what value can be placed on listening to Wu-Tang Clan with wind in my hair versus dreading another company restructure?

Just to be clear, my hair is secure underneath a helmet. Which was good for when I collided with a car and ended up with a face full of road. There are lots of bike paths in Melbourne, but far too many of them are squeezed in between moving traffic and parked traffic. They’re less than a metre wide and often occupied by wavering cars, massive trucks or in this case, part of a parked Ford Fiesta. Before I could react, a driver had opened their door into the bike lane without looking. I couldn’t do anything except stop my bike dead while my body crashed into the bitumen.

Things like this happen too often. I tore up my knee when my front wheel got caught in a tram track (a uniquely Melbourne problem) and my cheek laid against the road as I watched one of my earpods get crushed underneath a truck. A ute with aftermarket exhausts forced me into a gutter and my shins still haven’t recovered. It didn’t take long before I realised I could never relax on this job. My attention needs to be on 10 different things from one second to the next. My muscles are always tense, my brain always on alert. After a shift, it’s not unusual for my mind and body to immediately crash.

I always knew urban planning was designed around cars but now I feel it in my bones. Not only is the amount of space dedicated to cars immense, society focuses on cars first. Shopfronts and advertisements face the road, hundreds of car parks take up thousands of metres and I avoid countless potholes in bike lanes while the cars right next to me drive on pristine asphalt.

There’s also a stark difference between people in cars and people I deliver to. When I hand over my orders, most are friendly. They’re dealing with hangovers or excited to get their comfort food. I once said “Pizza time!” to some young kids and they cheered. On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.

Some customers I’ve delivered to have been downright apologetic. I suppose they feel guilty for getting their Maccas order delivered when they live around the corner. No judgment from me; I still get my bonus for doing nine deliveries by 2pm. Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods. Let’s say you wake up on Monday and the app promotes an offer to do 30 orders before Thursday. Complete this task, and you’ll get $72 extra. It’s nice but unreliable. They’re random events based on demand and location. It can be a big bonus or a big nothing. Then it simply becomes how much effort you’re willing to put in. Another factor of being independent.

Ultimately, this job isn’t a long-term solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The jury is still out on whether it’s better than being stuck at a desk. Air-conditioning versus sizzling heat. Freedom of movement versus monitored hours. Meetings that could have been an email versus an outdoor activity that is improving my fitness but has a very real chance of causing my untimely death. The money’s not as good but I meet nice people, get to know my city and choose my own hours.

By the way, the skinhead left me alone. I kept my mouth shut because I wasn’t about to risk my life for somebody’s $5 Boost Juice.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5046500711e3b9eaf6ecfe8b267fb4514a881eae/0_0_4556_3646/master/4556.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d7dcd0cbe4a957872c9d78feedc97a89",N,,2026-01-14 13:03:51.769237

London-listed biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has brought in Joris Silon as its new head of IR, in a move effective from 1 March.

Silon, who previously served as the firm’s country president for AstraZeneca US, will replace Andy Barnett, who is taking up another internal position.

AstraZeneca says Silon ‘led and delivered significant growth’ for the company in its largest market, according to a press release announcing the move. He joined AstraZeneca in 2000 and has held various leadership roles in Asia, Europe and the US.

Aradhana Sarin, the company’s CFO, says: ‘I am delighted that such a highly experienced and talented leader as Joris will lead our investor relations team through our next wave of growth.

‘I would also like to thank Andy Barnett for his remarkable leadership of our investor relations team over the past four years and wish him the best of luck as he transitions to an important new role within the company.’

Prior to joining Dollar Tree, he worked as vice president of investor relations and treasury at Burlington Stores and held other senior investment roles at Polar Asset Management Partners, Harvard Management Company and Wellington Management.

Stewart Glendinning, Dollar Tree’s CFO, says: ‘Daniel brings a strong combination of investor perspective, corporate finance expertise and leadership experience that will be instrumental in supporting our financial strategy and ongoing engagement with the investment community.’

Meanwhile, Andrew Slabin has announced that he is taking up a new role as vice president, investor relations at property rental portal Airbnb.

He joins the company from Warner Bros Discovery, where he has served as executive vice president, global investor strategy and investor relations since 2017.

Writing on LinkedIn, Slabin says: ‘[I am] thrilled to be joining a great team at such an exciting time for Airbnb!’

Warner Bros Discovery is currently the subject of an $83 bn takeover bid from Netflix, with a rival offer mounted by Paramount and prompting backlash from US politicians and entertainment industry leaders.

Staying in the US, railroad freight-car equipment maker The Greenbrier Companies has appointed Travis Williams as its new head of investor relations.

Most recently serving as senior director of investor relations at Enerpac Tool Group, Williams also held similar roles at Invesco, Stephens and Wasatch Global Investors.

Uh and so there there could be more of these episodes where you have uh uh air traffic, you know, uh banned to a certain region for a couple of weeks or months or or or you name it.
In general, though, uh you know, for a while, uh airlines stopped flying to Tel Aviv, etc., for a short time uh a couple of years ago.","The company, speaking of costs, the company is also putting in an order for Dreamliners, its first ever, 30 Boeing Dreamliners. Um, what does this tell you if anything about kind of the company's confidence in the future or where it's going?

It's an interesting item. So, uh, United had placed a very big, uh, order for Dreamliners and it's a great plane. Uh, it's performing well for airlines and and people like to fly in it. Uh, so

uh I think they're they're, uh, you know, they're they're interested in putting the best product out there. Um, and you know, the fact that it's a new model to them, I don't think is particularly meaningful. Uh, if it's the best plane that that you know, for the job.

Um, and when you're looking at um Delta, which obviously you see as a little bit expensive here, um, that said, most of the time it's sort of viewed as one of the best in class within the airlines. So, are there others you like better? Does or, you know, does it kind of it's

it's doing better than the rest and so, um, you know, how how are you kind of contextualizing it?

Right. I guess, uh, the way I view it, so best in class in a rowdy class. Airlines are are not a great business in general. I mean, again, they've been doing well, um, and and largely on the back of this kind of, uh, appetite for for premium travel.

Um, but but you know, if it isn't air traffic control or weather or something, there's there's sort of always something. It's it's an it's not a it's not an easy-going business. It's a tough business. Um, you know, and these billions of dollars of cash flow are very impressive and 10% operating margin. Um, but if you fast forward to sort of a more

slow economy or maybe potentially a recession someday in the next couple of years, uh, and that back half of the cabinet softens up even more, those numbers could shrink really quickly. Small changes in an airline's operations can make big changes to their bottom line.

Um, and Nicholas, I thought it was interesting, um, and again, this is something that could affect other airlines as well. I thought it was interesting the company talking a little bit about international travel and saying that some of the geopolitical tensions could potentially weigh there. How much of a factor, well, in the past, how much of a factor has that been? And and how much of a factor do you think it could be this year?

It well, we uh have been see I covered defense also. So, your geopolitics has been um on the tensions, let's say, have been on the rise for four or five years. Uh and so there there could be more of these episodes where you have uh uh air traffic, you know, uh banned to a certain region for a couple of weeks or months or or or you name it. Um, I wouldn't rule those possibilities out.

In general, though, uh you know, for a while, uh airlines stopped flying to Tel Aviv, etc., for a short time uh a couple of years ago. It doesn't really usually add up to that disastrous a number. Um, and they can work around it usually. Um, but it's it's always in the wings, let's say, as as a potential source of disruption or, you know, something that's going to alter the forecast here and there.

Nicholas, thanks so much. Appreciate it.

By steering through real tennis rallies using their phones, users were able to simulate Lexus’ steer-by-wire technology and gain a feel for its responsiveness and design.

“At last year’s ASB Classic, we put kinetic art on the court surface in replays of match rallies. That was an interesting way to have a Lexus brand presence within tennis,” said Steve Cochran, Chief Creative Officer at Saatchi & Saatchi NZ.

“But this year, we had the specific task to introduce a new vehicle that happened to have an evolutionary new feature – yoke steering. The word ‘rally,’ holding meaning in both tennis and car worlds, was the idea trigger for us – we turned Lexus New Zealand’s sponsorship into a unique and interactive product demonstration.”

Craig Burton, Manager Sales and Operations, Lexus New Zealand, added, “We’re excited to be bringing New Zealand’s first ever production vehicle with this technology and innovation to the country – and equally excited to provide a unique experience for guests. Bringing these together will offer fans an interactive taste of precision and performance – hallmarks of both world-class tennis and Lexus engineering.”

Spark Foundry New Zealand led the media strategy, partnering with Sky Sport to promote the campaign across stadium, broadcast, OOH, social and digital channels. Audiences are invited through paid media, social posts, and sponsorship placements to visit lexusrally.co.nz, where they can choose a growing selection of rallies from different tennis matches. Each drive generates a precision score that fans can share with friends, while standout performances are highlighted on Lexus’ social platforms throughout the tournament.

Production was headed by PXP Studios, Publicis Groupe’s technology-led innovation unit specialising in intelligent content and digital experiences that blend data and emerging technology.

Neil Duncan, Managing Director of Publicis Production ANZ, added, “To highlight the innovative features of the Lexus RZ, we put the experience into the hands of the audience by taking a mobile-first approach to the production, developing the entire driving experience to run directly in the browser. We crafted a user-focused interface that makes every interaction feel intuitive. By combining this with real-time 3D web rendering and motion-based controls, we delivered an interactive driving experience for users to enjoy wherever they are.”

Summary

Bank of New York Mellon delivered record net income in 2025, driven by digital platform and AI-driven cost efficiencies.

BK's capital-light model enabled robust shareholder returns via buybacks and dividends, while balance sheet growth outpaced long-term debt.

Despite 17% share price appreciation and a P/E of 15, I maintain a Hold rating, as valuation reflects modest, steady growth expectations.

Management guides for 5% revenue growth in 2026, but single-digit EPS growth remains the most likely scenario given BK's scale.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) just released earnings for Q4 and the full year. While the execution was good, the market knows what this stock is worth, and folks get a fair value for positive returns at low risk

I analyze securities based on value investing, an owner's mindset, and a long-term horizon. I don't write sell articles, as those are considered short theses, and I never recommend shorting.I was initially interested in a career in politics, but after reaching a dead-end in 2019 and seeing the financial drain this posed, I choose a path that would make my money work for me and protect me from more setbacks. This brought me to study value investing, in order to grow wealth with risk management in mind.From 2020 to 2022, I worked in a sales role at a law firm. As the top-grossing salesman, I eventually managed a team and contributed to our sales strategy. I spent much of my free time reading books and annual reports, steadily building my vault of knowledge about public companies. This period has since been useful in helping me assess a company's prospects by its sales strategy. I particularly get excited when the product seems to sell itself.From 2022 to 2023, I worked as an investment advisory rep with Fidelity, primarily with 401K planning. My personal study before that allowed me to pass my Series exams two weeks ahead of schedule, and I once again found myself excelling at the job. I learned a few useful things from this more formal setting, but my main frustration was that I was still a value investor, and Fidelity's 401K planning was based on modern portfolio theory. Lacking a way to change positions internally, I chose to walk away after a year.I gave writing for Seeking Alpha a try in November of 2023, and I've been here since. As I spent those years saving aggressively and building up my base of capital, I also actively invest now. My articles are how I share the opportunities that I seek for myself, and my readers are effectively walking this road alongside me.

Europe’s first non-recourse project financing dedicated to electric truck charging stations","In France, road freight transport accounts for 90% of commercial exchanges and represents 7.5% of greenhouse gas emissions. The sector plays a major role in the economy and is identified as a priority lever for decarbonisation(1). At the European Union level, new targets set in 2024 aim to reduce emissions from new heavy trucks by 45% from 2030 and by 90% from 2040 (compared to 2019). Today, the most advanced solution is the development of electric trucks.

Electric trucks: a solution on the right track

Beyond reducing emissions and pollution, electric trucks also offer financial benefits: while an electric truck currently costs more upfront than its diesel counterpart, charging is cheaper than refueling, and maintenance costs are lower(2). With ambitious targets and tight deadlines, manufacturers are ramping up production. As fleets grow, the success of heavy truck electrification now depends on the charging network.

Charging infrastructure: a critical challenge

In France and across Europe, public charging infrastructure requirements have been set for secure truck parking areas and along the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). The current pace is insufficient to build the necessary public infrastructure for fleet growth(2).

Depot charging is a major strategic priority. In France, out of 600,000 registered trucks, more than one-third operate on short routes (delivery, construction, waste collection…) with a daily return to the depot. Nearly 50% perform regional transport, returning to the depot every day or every other day. Current battery technology allows these trips to be completed on a single charge, followed by recharging upon return to the depot. From an economic standpoint, the goal is to achieve parity with diesel, despite a higher initial purchase cost. While public charging will play a role in the future, depot charging already offers better cost visibility for carriers today. Major players have already widely adopted this model, confirming its relevance. Depot charging will be the backbone of the system, while public hubs will serve as a complement.

The most significant development is the planned separation of Kraft Heinz into two distinct, publicly traded entities, slated for the second half of 2026.
Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?
The Road Ahead As of early 2026, Kraft Heinz's position can be summarized by several key points: * Stock Performance: Trading significantly below its 52-week peak, with a decline of approximately 16% over the past twelve months.
* Product Pipeline: Conducting worldwide tests of the ""Heinz Dipper"" to bolster its food service business.","The year 2026 marks a pivotal moment for Kraft Heinz as the company embarks on a comprehensive strategic overhaul. Following a challenging period, management is pursuing a dual-track approach focused on operational innovation and a fundamental corporate restructuring to reignite growth.

The most significant development is the planned separation of Kraft Heinz into two distinct, publicly traded entities, slated for the second half of 2026. The move aims to unlock shareholder value by allowing each business to pursue its unique strategy independently.

The two new companies will be:

* North American Grocery Co.

* Global Taste Elevation Co.

This division is designed to separate faster-growing, international segments from the more mature, slower-growing North American grocery business. While the market anticipates leaner operations and sharper strategic focus from the split, investors have also priced in the inherent complexity and execution risks. The associated costs and operational challenges are reflected in the company's current valuation discount.

New Leadership Drives Consumer-Centric Innovation

At the helm of this transformation is new Chief Executive Officer Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026. His early focus has been on aligning product development with specific, everyday consumer needs.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

A prime example is the global test launch of the ""Heinz Dipper,"" a french fry container featuring a built-in compartment for ketchup or other sauces. Currently in trial across eleven countries—including the United States, Canada, Germany, and China—the product targets the ""Away from Home"" food service sector. It responds directly to consumer demand for simpler, cleaner on-the-go eating options. Though a seemingly small innovation, the Dipper signals a broader shift toward practical, immediate-value innovations intended to drive volume in the food service channel.

Financial Performance and Market Pressure

Operationally, the company faces near-term earnings pressure. Market analysts project fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61, representing an approximate 27% decline compared to the same period last year. For the full fiscal year 2025, the consensus estimate stands at $2.53 per share, a drop of roughly 17%.

This outlook has weighed on the stock. Shares currently trade at $23.51, a level more than 20% below the 52-week high of $30.17. Despite some valuation metrics suggesting the stock appears inexpensive relative to industry peers, the lack of positive earnings momentum remains a persistent headwind.

The Road Ahead

As of early 2026, Kraft Heinz's position can be summarized by several key points:

* Stock Performance: Trading significantly below its 52-week peak, with a decline of approximately 16% over the past twelve months.

* Leadership: Under the guidance of new CEO Steve Cahillane since the start of the year.

* Corporate Strategy: Preparing for a separation into two independent public companies in late 2026.

* Product Pipeline: Conducting worldwide tests of the ""Heinz Dipper"" to bolster its food service business.

* Financials: Anticipated year-over-year decreases in EPS for both Q4 and the full year 2025.

The coming quarters will be critical in determining whether the combination of fresh leadership, targeted product launches, and a major corporate reorganization can translate into measurable profit growth and sustained margin improvement. The answer will ultimately decide if the current valuation gap persists or begins to close.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2431238_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 10:00:09.586052

Ahead of its annual results announcement on 27 February, Pearson said underlying sales were up 4% over the year, with growth picking up to 8% in the fourth quarter from 4% in the third.

The company said it delivered against its 2025 strategic priorities, launching its new AI-powered learning solution integrated into Microsoft 365 called Communication Coach. Ongoing momentum was also experienced in the enterprise side of the business, including a new strategic partnership with IBM and a vocational skilling contract for the construction sector in Saudi Arabia.

Underlying adjusted operating profit rose around 6% to £610m-615m, slightly ahead of the consensus forecast of £606m at the time of the company's last update in October.

However, one notable development was the loss of a key US Student Assessment contract in New Jersey. While the wider Assessments & Qualifications division - the company's largest at just under half of group sales - experienced 8% growth in the fourth quarter, and 4% for the whole year, Pearson said that the contract loss ""will be a headwind in H1 2026"".

""In 2025 we successfully delivered against our financial and strategic priorities by expanding our partnerships, growing our Enterprise reach, and advancing the use of AI to improve learning and upskilling,"" said chief executive Omar Abbosh. ""We enter 2026 with momentum, are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and remain well positioned to deliver value to our stakeholders.""

The stock was down 7.8% at 991.72p by 1018 GMT.

According to Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, the lack of a detailed outlook for 2026 and the lost New Jersey work ""saw Pearson punished in early trading"".

He said: ""In an environment with mounting concern about AI's ability to disrupt Pearson, its latest statement didn't offer the reassurance investors were looking for. Pearson needs to do more when it posts its full-year results next month to convince investors AI can be more of an opportunity than a threat and that it can realise an improvement in underperforming parts of the business.""",https://static.lse.co.uk/images/logo-og.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:06:39.964394

Its order of up to 60 Boeing 787-10 planes reinforces Delta's broader strategy of competing aggressively for premium long-haul travelers — a segment that has made the transatlantic market increasingly lucrative.

The new planes for long-haul routes will add pressure on US rivals American and United, which are also competing for the same international travelers, especially those in premium cabins that generate the most profit for airlines, including Delta.

Delta is hoping for a bigger piece of that pie.

It said the new 787 cabins will feature its signature Delta One business class alongside premium economy and standard coach. United has been particularly aggressive with niche transatlantic routes, while American has rolled out a new business-class product on its Dreamliners.

Delta's new jets won't arrive until the next decade. Until then, Delta will continue flying its aging 767s, which the Dreamliners will eventually replace.

Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in the airline's earnings call on Tuesday that the 787 is a ""financially great airplane"" that offers enhanced cargo capacity, improved fuel efficiency, and ample space for those all-important premium cabins.

Meanwhile, Hauenstein said the airline would grow capacity by 3% this year, with new seat growth concentrated in premium cabins.

Delta didn't disclose how much it was paying for the new planes.

It's the airline's first direct order of the popular jet, which has garnered more than 2,000 global orders. It represents a shift in its long-haul fleet strategy. Delta bought 30 and has options for 30 more.

The 787 will complement Delta's Airbus widebodies

Delta's purchase of Boeing 787s is significant for an airline that has long been dominated by Airbus on the widebody side.

The airline inherited a 787 order through its merger with Northwest Airlines back in 2008, but canceled it in 2016, citing delays, quality issues, and a preference for Airbus.

It opted for Airbus A330neo and A350-900 as its next-generation long-haul workhorses, and it expects to receive the larger A350-1000 later this year.

The addition of the 787‑10 diversifies and further modernizes the fleet. The variant ordered is the largest of the Dreamliner family, seating up to 336 passengers, but has the shortest range at roughly 7,300 miles.

Still, it outpaces the aging Boeing 767s that Hauenstein said the Dreamliner is set to replace, meaning it can carry more passengers more efficiently on both existing and new long-haul routes.

Delta's 767s primarily fly to Europe and South America, where the airline said the 787 would be an ""ideal addition.""

The order is a notable boost in confidence for Boeing, which has faced labor strikes, a change in leadership, and significant quality control issues for years — including on the 787 — but is gradually rebuilding trust from customers, investors, and regulators.

Delta made billions of dollars in 2025

The 787 deal comes alongside Delta's better-than-expected earnings report for the fourth quarter and full-year 2025.

ID18,Eli Lilly,2026-01-14 12:52:34+00:00,PharmaVoice,"Lilly, Novo test direct-to-employer approach that could cut out PBMs and lower costs","Michael Gibney, Kelly Bilodeau",,,,,https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/lilly-novo-direct-employer-drug-cost-pbm-consumer/809575/,"Can drugmakers find a way around the pharmacy benefit manager model often blamed for rising drug costs?
Meeting GLP-1 demand GLP-1 drugs marked a natural starting point for a direct-to-employer venture because of the highly competitive space they inhabit and a surplus of consumer demand.
But with the advent of direct-to-employer programs, PBMs could be incentivized to adjust their fees to stay competitive, driving down drug prices overall, Wilkins said.
One shift might include basing PBM fees on service delivery rather than drug costs.
Grappling with the unknowns While this direct-to-employer model ostensibly cuts out traditional PBMs, there’s still technically a middleman involved.","Can drugmakers find a way around the pharmacy benefit manager model often blamed for rising drug costs? Some pharma companies are giving it a shot by reaching out directly to large, self-insured employers.

For years, employers have sought to streamline their relationships with drugmakers to lower costs. But until recently, there was no clear path around PBMs, the intermediaries who distribute, formulate and process claims.

These middlemen often charge fees that erode the value of manufacturer rebates, said Drew Wilkins, a managing director at Deloitte, focused on commercial life sciences.

But amid growing political pressure to reduce drug costs and intense demand for GLP-1 drugs, pharma giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are this month testing a new direct-to-employer model that would allow self-insured companies to negotiate weight loss treatment prices directly with manufacturers.

The two companies are partnering with Waltz Health, a digital health company with a program that enables companies to purchase drugs at a fixed price. Waltz will administer the program, including patient eligibility, screening pharmacy and prescription-related tasks, as well as offering customer service support.

While these programs are currently limited to GLP-1 medications, Wilkins said they could mark the beginning of a broader shift, with more drugmakers adopting similar approaches and expanding drug offerings.

“We’re going to begin to see other manufacturers and large employers push on this and identify where it makes sense to have these models and how we can start to see them emerge,” he said.

Additional manufacturers could join the market as soon as the end of this year and eventually add more drugs.

“Early Alzheimer’s, other cognitive disorders and diseases like muscle weakening could be interesting candidates for these models, and a way to tap into an eager population trying to think about their overall health and wellbeing in the long run,” Wilkins said.

Other products may be less suited for the model.

“I do not expect that you’ll see it in things like rare diseases or oncology,” Wilkins said.

Meeting GLP-1 demand

GLP-1 drugs marked a natural starting point for a direct-to-employer venture because of the highly competitive space they inhabit and a surplus of consumer demand. A growing body of evidence shows that these drugs confer broader health benefits and potential cost savings over time, which makes them appealing to companies with long-term employees, Wilkins said.

Employees could share in those savings under the new model. Under the traditional model, the patient typically paid a percentage of the list price, not the lower net cost that includes a manufacturer’s rebate.

“So, if the drug is $1,000 and you have a 20% co-pay, you’re paying off that $1,000 even though the net price is probably closer to $500,” Wilkins said. “If we get rid of rebates and move closer to that net price, your co-pay … should be reduced as well.”

The model would also give patients broader access to GLP-1 drugs. Currently, only about 19% of companies with 200-plus employees provide GLP-1 coverage.

Direct-to-employer programs will likely be adopted primarily by mid-size and larger companies, but they could open the door to new drug pricing approaches more broadly. True innovation might not occur at the outset, Wilkins said, but a closer relationship between the manufacturer and the employer could drive change.

“They’ll be able to think about things like, what about a subscription model? What about other types of risk-based contracts, value-based contracts? The data flow will be cleaner, easier and better able to align the incentives,” he said.

But the trajectory will largely depend on how this initial foray plays out.

Read More in Patient

This model could also spur PBM changes. Some PBMs, feeling the pricing pinch, have already moved to secure new GLP-1 rebates and discounts from manufacturers for group health plans that could lower costs for patients.

But with the advent of direct-to-employer programs, PBMs could be incentivized to adjust their fees to stay competitive, driving down drug prices overall, Wilkins said. One shift might include basing PBM fees on service delivery rather than drug costs. It might not cost the PBM more to deliver services for a $10,000-a-year product versus a $100,000-a-year product, he said.

Grappling with the unknowns

While this direct-to-employer model ostensibly cuts out traditional PBMs, there’s still technically a middleman involved. In theory, Waltz and other potential intermediaries could come to resemble PBMs over time. But Wilkins said he hopes the model will bring change, even if it takes time to get there.

“I think if it proves itself and demonstrates that it really is a way to lower costs to self insured employers and patients, while also being accretive to manufacturers, it could really trigger a wider paradigm shift in how we structure the access landscape, how we provide drugs, and how drugs are purchased and provided to patients,” Wilkins said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1xSmgDafIj5URtpnn1PX5Y8GDdZo2HndmcVqEY16bec/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTQyODk5OTgxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-14 08:59:15.134810

But Google’s (GOOGL) launch of Gemini 3 and a new deal with the iPhone maker have changed the game.

Google and Apple on Monday revealed a multi-year collaboration in which Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology will power the next generation of Apple's AI, including a long-awaited new version of its voice assistant Siri coming this year. Bloomberg had previously reported that the two tech giants were planning a deal in November, saying the agreement would involve Apple paying Google $1 billion annually, though the companies did not respond to a request to confirm that figure.

Prediction Market powered by

On top of the reported licensing revenue, Google is set to see a boost in cloud revenue from the collaboration, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance. And because Google’s own AI models are now positioned to run on the vast majority of smartphones worldwide — both iPhones and Android devices — the company is effectively disrupting its Search business on its own terms rather than ceding that shift to a competitor like OpenAI. Overall, the Apple deal has all but cemented Google’s dominance in a heated AI market, with the news sending Google parent Alphabet's market capitalization north of $4 trillion for the first time on Monday.

At the same time, analysts said, the news marked a major setback for the ChatGPT developer.

“ It's a huge loss for OpenAI,” said DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria. “ The fact that OpenAI didn't get that deal with Apple sets them back quite a bit.”

Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Andrew Freedman added, “ It's a landmark deal, and it sets the stage for Google to continue to dominate.”

He called it a ""blow"" to OpenAI.

“As Gemini continues to grow in usage and adoption as a general-purpose LLM [large language model], it absolutely presents a risk and makes it harder for OpenAI to continue to take share,” Freedman said.

Google took OpenAI by surprise in late 2025, as the launch of its Gemini 3 model surpassed rival AI models on industry benchmarks. Sam Altman declared a “code red,” and OpenAI quickly unveiled a new model, GPT-5.2, to mixed reviews about how it stacked up to Gemini 3.

Before Google began closing the gap on OpenAI’s lead, Apple inked a partnership with the AI developer to roll out ChatGPT on its iPhones in 2024, marking Apple’s first big agreement with an AI developer as its own artificial intelligence strategy remained murky. Apple reportedly mulled using OpenAI’s tech to power its next-generation voice assistant, Siri.

But analysts speculated that a shift occurred when — in an apparent challenge to Apple — OpenAI merged with the startup of the tech giant’s former chief designer, Jony Ive, to create a yet-to-be-revealed AI consumer hardware device. OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Jony Ive have suggested that their upcoming device could surpass today's consumer devices, frequently hinting at Apple as a benchmark.

“ [OpenAI] picked a fight with Alphabet by launching a browser … They partnered with Jony Ive to pick a fight with Apple,” said BNP Paribas' Nick Jones. “So ... you’re rattling the cage of a lot of huge companies with very strong balance sheets and a lot to lose.”

Meanwhile, Google holds a strategic advantage: Its scale across cloud computing, chip design, and both enterprise and consumer software makes it, in Jones’s words, “the only vertically integrated AI provider"" and an ideal AI partner for other tech giants.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT still holds the lead when compared to Google's Gemini app in terms of usage, though analysts say that lead is rapidly narrowing. Another hurdle the startup must contend with is its mounting costs due to its recent deal spree — OpenAI's spending is set to hit $1.4 trillion over the next eight years — while its revenue is currently a fraction of that amount, totaling around $13 billion in 2025, according to The Information.

As Jones put it, “ Things are getting more difficult for OpenAI.""

""A more interventionist Donald Trump who is pressuring the Fed, demanding corporations do as he wishes, and plans to take Greenland are all driving flows into the relative safety of gold,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.

Separately, Bank of England policymaker Alan Taylor said UK interest rates should keep falling as inflation is on track to hit the 2% target by mid-2026, earlier than previously forecast.

London-listed miners rose, with Antofagasta, Rio Tinto and Glencore gaining between 1.1% and 2.1%, boosted by higher copper prices. [MET/L]

The pharmaceutical index also advanced, up 1.6%, helped by heavyweight AstraZeneca after the drugmaker agreed to buy Boston-based Modella AI, as the industry increasingly uses artificial intelligence to speed up drug discovery.

Capping gains on the FTSE 100, the media index slipped 2.8%, dragged by an 8% drop in Pearson, the benchmark's worst performer.

The British education company reported that its biggest division, Assessment & Qualifications, lost a contract with New Jersey, which will be a headwind in the first half of 2026.

BP fell 1.3% after the oil major said it expects to book $4 billion to $5 billion in fourth-quarter impairments, mainly tied to its energy transition businesses.

They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.","There were two little letters on everyone's lips: AI.

Each year, the National Retail Federation, a leading industry trade group, hosts one of the industry's largest conferences, known as Retail's Big Show. I attended the convention, held in New York City from January 11 to 13, for the first time to hear from industry insiders about the retail trends to watch in 2026.

This year's event drew speakers such as Walmart's incoming CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who announced a new AI deal this week, as well as Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin. It was clear that artificial intelligence was the big topic on the minds of the attendees from over 5,000 brands at the event.

Walking the expo hall, ""AI"" and ""agentic"" seemed to be mentioned on nearly every other banner or booth I passed. Onstage, retail leaders touted their AI strategies.

Large retailers, such as Walmart and Lowe's, have introduced their own AI shopping agents or partnered with AI platforms like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT; however, these efforts are still in their early stages.

I also saw firsthand how some companies are experimenting with new technologies. There were humanoid robots walking up to greet attendees and digital drive-thru menu boards with bright colors advertising to retailers what their AI-powered menus could look like.

Customer service is the driving force behind a lot of AI efforts

Despite some of the noise surrounding retail's AI-powered direction, CEOs, including Fran Horowitz of Abercrombie & Fitch, said young founders should keep the fundamentals top of mind while embracing innovation. Improving customer service, for instance, remains at the forefront of retailer decision-making.

In one session, Ralph Lauren's chief branding and innovation officer, David Lauren, talked about his brand's longtime partnership with Microsoft. It led to the creation of Ask Ralph, a chatbot-style customer assistant. The bot is powered by Microsoft's AI, but it is designed to function like a styling assistant that suggests clothing based on prompts, such as an occasion you're attending.

It's a taste of the future with the personal touch customers may want from a store associate.

""It's like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket,"" Lauren said at the conference.

Quality takes priority over convenience

Currently, AI is most useful for bargain-hunting and basic customer service, according to a panel about Gen Z that included members of The Z Suite, a collective of consultants specializing in the consumer space. Chatbots like Ask Ralph can be convenient in a pinch, but the shopping experience doesn't begin and end there, the Gen Z consultants who ranged in age from 17 to 24 said.

Young people seem to still crave some of the old-school fundamentals that define retail: quality, customer service, and in-store experiences. There's no replicating trying on the perfect dress in person, one young panelist said.

They said they see AI as a starting point that they can use to find the unique items they covet. They're willing to put in the work to find the right item for them. This includes scouring Reddit for ""real"" reviews that TikTok influencers may not offer, said Olivia Meyer, a buyer who is part of The Z Suite.

And although they're not rushing to get on the phone with a customer service representative, the consultants said they want to talk to a human when their money is at stake.

Consumers want the truth about what they're buying

These Gen Z retail professionals, who also included a global merchant for Calvin Klein and a marketing associate, said they want their clothes to come from authentic brands that are transparent about their use of AI. They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.

They want to get their money's worth for the clothes that they're buying, which is why data shows this demographic is straying away from fast fashion and toward shopping secondhand on sites like Vinted and eBay.

True Religion's chief marketing officer, Kristen D'Arcy, who moderated the panel, said shoppers are craving authenticity in the world of AI-generated content, and it's making them more discerning. To that end, the denim brand has leveraged partnerships that align with its values, such as collaborations with artists like Megan Thee Stallion.

The three-day event gave me a glimpse into the retail landscape of 2026.

AI may be the loudest trend, but that doesn't mean brands should forget the basics.",https://i.insider.com/69665e6104eda4732f2ef646?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-14 11:07:12.950737

Perhaps no data point better encapsulates the American economy right now than this nugget from Delta’s quarterly earnings:

It was the first time ever that Delta’s premium sales eclipsed those from economy.

Put another way: Rich people and the companies they work for and own are doing great, while the masses are tightening their belts — a classic K-shaped economy moment. But Delta’s results also reveal where the company is placing its bets on the 2026 economy. If Delta is right, the good times will keep rolling on for the premium occupants, while the masses crammed into coach can expect more of the same.

Delta, the biggest US carrier by market value, projects a 20% profit increase in 2026, largely on the backs of its “premium” customers — not just the corporate clients who have always been reliable customers for airlines, but also a surge of wealthier travelers who are leveling up their vacations.

That means that as Delta expands its seat capacity by 3% this year through interior upgrades and new aircraft, its focus is squarely on the front of the plane.

“Effectively, none of our growth in seats will be in the main cabin. Virtually all will be in the premium sector,” Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said on a call with news outlets.

Once again, it pays to be rich.

Delta is leaning into its premium offerings, wagering that this shift to more expensive travel isn’t just a fad.

It’s not alone. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu told the Financial Times that the airline industry was in “a premium arms race,” investing heavily into loyalty programs and higher-end lounges to compete for well-heeled, higher-margin travelers.

That may be good news for the upper-rung folks. For the lower rung, the outlook is more of the same.

And if you haven’t flown economy in a while, well, the same is pretty much the bare minimum flying experience. There’s nothing quite like boarding a commercial jet to render that vague concept of a K-shaped economy into a literal ~experience~ of class division in America.

Sure, you shelled out 500 bucks for a last-minute bachelorette weekend in Cabo, and yeah, you’re stuck in a middle seat with no recline in Row 6,453, but hey, at least you’re getting away. But before you get to your seat, you’ve got to walk by the folks in premium with their leg room and cocktails and designer yoga pants who paid double or even triple what you paid. And worse still, they have to witness you with your sweatpants and duffel bag as you make your way to god knows where in the back.

You and the rest of the peasants — you’re going to get through this. Up front, the view is only getting better.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2244278454.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 12:04:39.402209

The US growth equity market grew 2.1x by value in 2025 to $234bn (2024 $109.7bn). The growth was fuelled by AI raises which grew 3.3x yoy and accounted for 57% of total proceeds. Europe, where the AI effect was less marked and the leading sector was software, saw the value of raises grow by 44% in 2025 to $49.2bn.

The US

Our Rothschild & Co Deals Monitor tracks US VC deals valued at $100m or more. We recorded 487 US growth equity deals of $100m or more in 2025 raising a total of $234.1bn. This compared with 309 such deals raising $109.7bn in 2024, growth of $124bn yoy in value or 113%. The summary tables for both years show the raises split by sector with the top three raises by value in each one.

A few features:

Concentration: The top ten deals in 2025 cumulatively raised $106.5bn, 45% of the annual total. The equivalent 2024 figures were $47.6bn and 43%.

AI dominates: There were 84 AI deals in 2025 raising $132.6bn, 57% of the annual total. Three deals provided just over half of this total, the $40bn Open AI raise announced in March, the $15bn raise for Anthropic in November and the $14.3bn raise for Scale AI backed by Meta in June. The dominance of AI was more marked than in 2024 when big AI raises were really just a Q4 phenomenon. In 2024 AI raises totalled $40.8bn, 37% of the annual total with the largest raise being $10bn for Databricks.

AI infusing the growth equity market: There are a number of other sectors which are proxies for AI. These are sectors where the companies are either serving AI (datacentres, quantum, semiconductors) or are applications of AI (autonomous vehicles, robotics, legal tech).

Here we see how AI is broadening its effect across VC as investors look to take advantage of the AI phenomenon more widely through associated industries. Cumulatively those six sectors raised another $13.8bn in 2025 or 6% of the total, taking the total AI percentage of the annual raise to 63%.

Thirty raises of $1bn +: There were 30 raises of $1bn or more in 2025. Of these 17 were for AI businesses including all the top eight raises. Two were for datacentre businesses powering AI and one (Cerebras Technologies) for an AI semiconductor business. The biggest non AI raises were for metaverse business Infinite Reality ($3bn from a mysterious private investor in January); $2.5bn for defence business Anduril, $2.1bn for the insurance brokerage, Acrisure; $2bn for Polymarket and $1bn for Kalshi in the blockchain driven prediction markets; $1bn for the Sam Altman-backed age defying Retro Biosciences; $1bn for Elon Musk’s X; $1bn for PsiQuantum; $1bn for the humanoid robotics business FigureAI and $1bn for grid batteries business, Base Power.

In 2024 there were 14 $1bn+ raises, eight of which were for AI businesses plus one large raise ($9.2bn) for datacentre business, Vantage Data Centres.

Software prominent: 2025 saw 72 raises for software business totalling $14bn (2024 40 raising $8.5bn). Software businesses tend to be asset light, cash generative and frequently profitable, meaning that the amounts they raise are typically smaller than those in AI. The average size of raise was $194m. The three biggest deals were $700m for Savyint, a security, compliance, identity governance and access management solution; $500m for Metropolis (a $1.6bn total raise including a $500m equity element) for its AI powered frictionless parking payment platform and $500m for Nerdio, a business that simplifies the deployment and management of Microsoft cloud technologies.

Biotech and FinTech revivals continue: AI powered drug discovery is a major theme in Biotech. It swapped second position in sector raises in 2024 (77 raises for $12.6bn) for third position in 2025 (69 raises for $12.5bn). The biggest raises were for $1bn for Retro Biosciences which, Sam Altman backed, is looking to develop drugs to extend the human lifespan by ten years; Kailera Therapeutics, which has a programme of obesity drugs, raised $600m and Maplight Therapeutics raised $373m in a Series D for its therapies for central nervous system disorders.

Fintech was the fourth largest category in 2025 with $10.3bn raised across 36 deals (2024 seventh position, $4.3bn raised, 25 deals). The key deal was the $2.1bn raise for Acrisure a financial services platform combining AI across its services in insurance, reinsurance, cybersecurity, real estate, payroll, benefits, and wealth management. The alternative investment platform iCapital raised $820m in July. In April the open banking business Plaid raised $575m in a round valuing the business at $6bn, down from $13.4bn in 2021.

The biggest movers: Three sectors – Defense, Crypto/Blockchain; Quantum

These three sectors saw the biggest relative upwards movement between 2024 and 2025:

Defense – Moving to offense: The sixth largest sector for VC raises in 2025 was Defense, up from tenth slot in 2024. Defense companies raised $7.2bn in 20 $100m+ deals (2024 three deals raised $1.8bn). The outlook for the defence sector changed in mid-February 2025 when US vice president JD Vance announced that, as far as the US was concerned, Europe must take responsibility for its own security, sparking a scramble by European countries to raise their GDP spending on defence and step up their direct support for Ukraine. Simultaneously the US has been redirecting its defence spending into new avenues to reflect the changing nature of warfare, demonstrated by the evolving nature of the conflict in the Ukraine.

The three leading raises in Defense in 2025 were from the same companies and in the same order as the three leading companies in 2024. The biggest in 2025 was the $2.5bn for Anduril Industries (2024 $1.5bn) led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. Anduril offers a range of autonomous defence systems powered by Lattice, an AI-based operating system that connects autonomous sensemaking and command & control capabilities with modular and scalable hardware components. Products include the Barracuda family of military drones, the Roadrunner reusable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) Autonomous Air Vehicle (AAV) and the Dive-LD autonomous underwater vehicle.

Saronic raised $600m in 2025 ($175m in 2024). It describes its mission as ‘redefining maritime superiority for the United States and its allies.’ Saronic develops autonomous surface vessels and will use the 2025 funds to build a new shipyard, Port Alpha, allowing it to expand its medium and large-class autonomous vessels - effectively water-borne drones.

CHAOS Industries raised $510m (2024 $145m). It is building Coherent Distributed Networks (CDN™) systems that give ‘warfighters’ time to act against borders and autonomous threats, essentially sensor technology for the military sector including the Vanquish radar to detect missiles, drones and aircraft and the Astria radar to monitor the environment for long periods.

Blockchain/Crypto: Crypto went out of style following the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and was the 28th ranked sector for US raises in 2024 with just two deals of $100m plus raising a total of $325m. The crypto friendly US administration helped spark a revival of interest in 2025. There were 12 deals raising $3bn pushing the sector into eleventh place. Indeed, if combined with the three raises in the blockchain based Prediction Markets businesses (Polymarket and Kalshi raised $3.3bn between them) the sector could be said to have raised $6.3bn, pushing it up to seventh place, just behind defense.

Leading the raises was the $800m round led by Jane Street for the crypto exchange Kraken, a globally scaled and regulated infrastructure stack that spans spot trading, derivatives, equities, tokenized assets, staking and payments. A subsequent $200m strategic investment by Citadel Securities was executed at a $20bn valuation. In October the Stripe and Paradigm backed payments-focused Layer 1 blockchain business Tempo raised $500m in a Series A led by Greenoaks and Thrive Capital. The crypto payments business Ripple raised $500m at a valuation of $40bn in November. The business has expanded from payments into custody, stablecoins, prime brokerage and corporate treasury.

Quantum: AI enables machines to learn, make decisions, and recognize patterns. Quantum computing aims to process information in distinct ways that classical computers cannot, making problem-solving faster and more accurate. Quantum can potentially speed up the training of AI models, optimise their functionality, perform better processing of large datasets, tackle complex problems in areas like drug discovery and materials science and improve natural language processing.

As interest in AI has grown, so has the engagement with quantum. There were five deals in quantum in 2025 raising $2.13bn, up from just one deal at $300m in 2024. PsiQuantum’s $1bn Series E in September led by BlackRock was one of the largest financings ever in quantum computing and valued the company at $7bn. Professor Jeremy O’Brien, PsiQuantum co-founder and CEO commented

‘Only building the real thing—million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines—will unlock the promise of quantum computing.”

US Growth Equity raises in 2025 – 487 deals of $100m+ raising $234bn

A few features:

Smaller: The $49bn raised is just 21% of the total $234bn raised in the US. The yoy uplift was also more modest at 44% versus the 113% in the US.

Less concentrated: The leading US sector, AI, accounted for 57% of all raises in the US in 2025. In Europe the top six sectors combined reach the 57% figure.

AI is prominent, not dominant: AI was the second largest sector by funds raised in 2025 with $5.3bn (2024 $2.8bn) raised across 35 (2024 17) deals, equivalent to 11% of funds raised in the year. It supplied the biggest raise of the year, the $2bn Series C for French LLM, Mistral but only one more in the top 10, the $600m raise for AI drug design business, Isomorphic Labs.

Broader AI impacts: Looking at the proxy sectors for AI (datacentres, quantum, semiconductors, autonomous vehicles, robotics, legal tech) the influence of AI becomes more marked with these sectors adding another $6.1bn or 12% to the annual total.

Software leads the way: The Software sector rose to be the largest sector by value of raises in 2025 overtaking Climate Tech. There were 113 rounds raising $7.5bn (2024 100 deals raising $5.6bn), growth in value of 25% yoy.

The three biggest deals all came late in the year led by October’s $710m ($270m primary, $440m secondary) round for Bending Spoons at an $11bn valuation. Bending Spoons is a serial acquiror of digital businesses owning Brightcove, Evernote, komoot, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard, and WeTransfer, and with the October round helping to fund the acquisitions of Vimeo and AOL. The French CRM (customer relationship management) company Brevo raised $575m in December. Lovable, the Swedish vibe coding business raised $20m in its July Series A at a $1.8bn valuation and followed this up with a $330m raise at a $6.6bn valuation in December. The business was founded in July 2023, reported $1m in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in November 2024 and $200m of ARR in November 2025.

Climate Tech slipped into fourth place by sector value in 2025 with 68 raises bringing in $4.9bn (2024 $6.5bn across 83 raises). We have noticed since the demise of Northvolt that the ambitious funding programmes for long term projects in this field have died away. In 2023 European Climate Tech had two deals of over $1bn (H2 Green Steel, Northvolt) and another three of more than $500m (Verkor, Zenobe and Northvolt again). In 2024 there were just two deals of more than $500m (Sunfire $550m, RP Global $528m). In 2025 there were none with the largest deal in the sector being the $420m for green flexibility in Germany in January.

Biotech was again well represented: There were 66 deals in 2025 raising a fraction under $5bn with the largest being the $410m Series A by Verdiva Bio which is focused on developing a weekly (as opposed to daily) dosed oral GLP-1 focused obesity treatment. Next in line was the $358m raise by German cancer treatment biotech, Tubulis. The sector saw good growth with the value of deals rising by 29% versus the $3.87bn of 2024.

It was a strong year for healthcare as well with the value of raises rising by $1.65bn (+87%) yoy boosted by the $900m raise for smart rings business Oura in October valuing the business at $11bn. Oura had previously raised $200m at a $5.2bn valuation in December 2024. There was also a substantial $260m raise for Daniel Ek backed healthcare scanning centre business Neko Health as it built out its network of scanning centres.

Fintech and the return of crypto: Fintech has been staging a solid recovery since H2 2024. It is represented in the top 10 European raises of the year by the $500m round from the Israeli global payments’ platform Rapyd in March to fund its acquisition of Dutch fintech PayU from Prosus. In total 2025 saw 58 raises by Fintechs for a total of $4bn (2024 55 deals for $3.6bn).

As in the US, there has been a marked revival in blockchain/crypto deals, with 12 European deals in 2025 raising $659m led by the $136m Series C from Fnality, which is a global settlement network employing distributed ledger technology to connect wholesale markets with tokenised and decentralized markets. In 2024 there were just five deals raising a total of $195m.

The biggest movers: Four sectors – Cybersecurity, Datacentres, Defence, Quantum

Cybersecurity moved up from 15th to 7th in the sector rankings between 2024 and 2025 with the value of raises up 5.4x from $469m to $2.57bn. Of the 36 raises in the sector, 24 were from businesses based in Israel which has become the European centre of excellence for this industry. These included the three biggest raises, the $400m for the AI and data security business Cyera at a valuation of $9bn; the $359m Series G raise by Cato Networks and the $120m raise for Vega.

Datacentres are key to AI development. Datacentres are the real estate of AI in terms of availability of GPUs and land and energy access to drive them. European businesses raised $2.1bn in 2025 up from just $155m in 2024, jumping to eighth position in terms of sector value. Over three quarters of the total came from just two deals, reflecting the scale of the capex in this sector.

The UK’s Nscale described its $1.1bn October raise as the largest Series B in European history. The hyperscaler will use the proceeds to further its deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure across Europe, North America and the Middle East, enabling the rapid rollout of the company’s “AI factory” data centres for projects like Stargate UK and Stargate Norway, and the expansion of its vertically integrated AI cloud platform. The Norwegian energy and industrial group Aker led the round with $285m of funding and payment in kind. The latter consisted of a portion of its Narvik land portfolio in northern Norway. In exchange Aker will receive a 9.3% stake in Nscale whose implied valuation was c$3bn. Swedish datacentre business EcoDataCenter raised $521m in equity in March and followed this with $700m in debt financing in September. The business has teamed with Coreweave to build one of Europe's largest AI clusters in Falun, Sweden.

Quantum Computing – the next leg of AI: There has been a flurry of raises on both sides of the Atlantic for quantum computing businesses reflecting the view that quantum computing is the next key stage in the development of AI. Europe, traditionally the poor relation to the US in quantum computing funding, saw 14 deals in 2025 with five at over $100m (IQM Quantum - $320m, Multiverse Computing $215m, Quantum Machines $170m, Classiq $110m and Alice & Bob $105m). Quantum leaped from 20th to 10th in the sector rankings with a $1.2bn or 6.7x increase in yoy funding to $1.38bn.

Defence scaling up: As in the US, interest in VC funding of emerging defence business quickened as the year went on. The experience of the Ukraine war has shifted the focus of incremental defence spending from traditional military platforms (tanks, warships, planes) to new technologies like AI, robotics, autonomous solutions, quantum computing and cybersecurity.

Our Deal Monitor records twelve defence deals, led by the $690m Helsing Series D in June valuing the business at $13.8bn. Helsing designs AI applications focusing on all-domain defence spanning air, land, sea, space, and cyber using AI software to process information from defence systems and improve battlefield decisions. It also had the largest defence raise in 2024, its $487m Series C valuing the business at $5.4bn.

May 2025 saw a $176m round for the German Quantum Systems, an ‘aerial data intelligence company that provides multi-sensor data collection products to government agencies and commercial customers.' It is a dual use business with commercial as well as defence applications with government contracts in the US, the Ukraine, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Colombia. This was followed by an additional $180m round led by Balderton Capital in November, lifting the company’s valuation above €3bn. At the end of the year the Finnish satellite developer Iceye which has adapted its satellite monitoring fleet for defence use, raised $233m at a $2.8bn valuation.

The ‘missing’ sector- Online grocery: Online grocery businesses raised $1.1bn in 2024 with Getir, Rohik, Flink and Picnic all making $100m plus raises. Europe has fallen out of love with the instant grocery delivery model meaning in 2025 there was just one raise in this space, albeit a substantial one, the $495m raise by Dutch business Picnic. In an associated sector there was a clutch of ride hailing and e-mobility raises from the likes of FINN, Voi and Blacklane in 2024. There were none in 2025.

Europe’s biggest growth equity raises in 2025.

Our predictions for growth equity in 2025 – how did we do?

In the January 2025 edition of the R&Co Growth Equity Update we made ten predictions for the coming year. We review here how we did. Marking our own homework, gives a score of 7.5 out of 10….

We made ten predictions. We show each in italics and our assessment of the current state of play and of our prediction beneath each one.

1. Artificial Intelligence to dominate and widen: A two-tier market has emerged in venture capital. It’s AI, and then everything else. AI captured around a third of all new VC funding in 2024. The pace quickened with Q4 being the largest quarter by some distance for funding of big AI deals. These deals, and the rapid valuation uplifts between rounds, have only stoked the appetite of investors for exposure to the potential industry transformations that the application of AI offers. We expect that the net will widen in 2025 and that a broader range of investors will seek to gain exposure to AI amongst application specific businesses.

Not bad as a prediction and less obvious than it seemed at the time. It was only in Q4 2024 that the start of the surge in growth funding for AI businesses began. In 2024 our revised numbers show that 37% of US venture funding was for AI businesses, a total of $40.8bn. In 2025 the percentage rose to 57% and the total to $133.3bn

2. Datacentres: ‘Data is the new oil’: Or should that be datacentres? It seems that, despite a slew of large fund raises for data centre operators in 2024 (Vantage Data Centres $9.2bn; Coreweave $1.1bn; Crusoe Energy $500m, Lightmatter $400m) there appears plenty of potential for more. Analysts at Mogan Stanley anticipate there will be 70% pa growth in GenAI related power demand 2024-27 growing from <15 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2023 to 224 TWh in 2027.

Here we were looking in the right ballpark, but the theme expressed itself largely away from the growth equity market. Indeed, one of the Stock Market’s biggest themes in 2025 was the burgeoning AI capex requirement faced by the hitherto capital light tech companies. The amount of capital deployed in data centre development via growth equity raises shrank in 2025 versus 2024. The 2024 total of $10.8bn was boosted by the $9.2bn raise for Vantage Data Centres late in the year. The equivalent figure in 2025 was $5.2bn with Crusoe Energy leading the way with a $1.4bn raise.

3. A revival in Fintech: 2024 was another tough year with a 20% yoy drop in global Fintech funding estimated by Innovate Capital. A report from Silicon Valley Bank in late October observed that fundraising by Fintech oriented VC firms has dropped by over 90% since its peak in 2021. We think though that 2025 is set to see a revival in VC funding for FinTech.

The revival of fintech did occur in 2025 with the 25 rounds raising $4.3bn in the US in 2024 expanding to 36 raises reaching $10.3bn in 2025, a 2.4x increase. There was substantial activity also in the secondary market for fintech, including big secondaries from Stripe and Revolut as well as some high profile fintech IPOs.

4. ClimateTech - less hot: An unusual feature of the European VC market in the last couple of years was that, even as investors became more cautious about pre-revenue/profit/cash flow businesses in the wake of the change to the interest rate environment, there was still a surprising amount of support for ClimateTech companies which were pre-revenue and certainly pre-profit and which required heavy capital investment to build projects like battery gigafactories or networks of EV charging station stations. As the world gets warmer some of the urgency in pursuing such climate led opportunities appears to have dissipated, the outlook for electric vehicle sales has waned (fewer incentives, lower prices for used EVs, rapid charging infrastructure issues) and the incoming Trump administration (‘Drill, baby, drill’) appears less likely to promote climate initiatives. The Chapter 11 filing by Northvolt, which had received $14-15bn of venture funding, is also a jolt to the system. We think a scaling back of ambition in ClimateTech raises may be a feature of 2025.

A decent prediction. In Europe raises in Climate Tech declined in value from c$6.5bn in 2024 to $4.9bn in 2025. The very substantial raises that typified 2021-23 remained absent but there was a steady stream of $100m plus deals – 16 in total in 2025- led by the $420m raised for green flexibility, the $330m for Skynrg and $172m for Aira.

In the US Climate Tech had a stronger year with the amount raised up from $5.2bn in 2024 to $9.8bn in 2025. The bigger deals though are AI and datacentre related raises in the guise of Climate Tech. Thus, two of the three biggest deals classed as Climate Tech were for fusion and nuclear energy developers, with these technologies seen as key to providing power sources for new AI datacentre demand.

Fusion energy as a solution to the world’s energy needs is a technology under intense development and Commonwealth Fusion System’s $863m raise was the largest of its kind this year. Ally Yost its Senior Vice President of Corporate Development referenced how the interest in powering AI datacentres has quickened investor interest in new energy tech like fusion power.

‘CFS offers investors the clearest path to bringing commercial fusion to the world — and an unprecedented opportunity to make a real impact as global demand for power accelerates with electrification and increased use of AI and data centres.’

Similarly, the third largest raise in Climate Tech was the $700m round for small modular nuclear reactor business X Energy. Amazon supported this raise. Its Vice President of Global Data Centres Kevin Miller was the one to explain the investment.

“This collaboration between Amazon and X-energy is a significant step toward accelerating advanced nuclear technologies that can help us bring new sources of carbon-free energy to the grid cost-effectively and safely.”

5. Venture capital activity to grow again in 2025: After two years of decline from the heady peaks of 2021 global VC activity grew in 2024 over 2023. Pitchbook estimates that global funding for VC firms increased, albeit by just 5%, from $349bn in 2023 to $368bn in 2024. We think that VC deal value will rise again in 2025 for four reasons (i) there is intense interest in artificial intelligence and associated technologies, and we think these areas will continue to attract substantial funding in 2025 (ii) the public markets have had two years of 20%+ returns. This is positive for investor mood - critical for VC investing (iii) The quality of companies is better. After three years of adapting operating practices to accommodate growth with profits /cashflow rather than all out growth, the universe of VC companies is more investable while valuation expectations are tempered – a better environment for VC investing (iv) if –as we expect – the IPO market improves in 2025- the liquidity of the whole private capital system will improve in turn.

We got this one right, and it was a tougher prediction than it looked with the AI surge in the last three months of 2024 only just taking the 2024 total past 2023. We underestimated the extent to which 2025 would exceed 2024. At $234bn vs $109.7bn the US growth equity market grew 2.1x in 2025. In Europe, where the AI effect was less marked, growth was 44% to $49.2bn.

Europe – Value of growth equity raises up 44% in 2025

We also discussed,

How will the end of 2025 look? US interest rates may be only 30bps lower than the levels of the start of the year as inflation remains stubbornly high. There may be some shocks to global trade caused by the imposition of tariffs by the US and retaliatory activity elsewhere. Global GDP growth remains relatively weak (US GDP growth is forecast by the OECD at 2.4% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024 with a further slowdown to 2.1% for 2026). Public investors may have made some good money on reasonably priced IPOs. Venture Capital companies will be three years into the focus on profits and growth, more and more will be turning the corner to demonstrate that profitability is there and looking for funding for renewed growth.

US interest rates fell further than expected in 2025, starting the year at 4.25%-4.5% and ending the year down 75bps at 3.5%-3.75%. The Fed’s December 2024 dot plot had just 50bps of rate cuts in 2025. The annual inflation rate in the US came in at 2.7% in December 2025 having ended 2024 at 2.9%. US GDP growth was at 4.3% annualised in Q3, stronger than expected and implying about 2% for the year (Q1 was down) with c2% expected for 2026. The performance of 2025’s IPOs was reasonable (the average premium to IPO price at the end of the year was c20%). Enthusiasm for VC companies, especially in AI remained high.

And so, what about 2026?

One of the lessons of 2025 is to make fewer predictions and so the first thing is to focus on some of the key issues:

1. Will the value of Growth Equity deals rise again in 2026?

The US: This is a tough one as 2025 was a remarkable year of growth in the US market, up by $125bn yoy to $234bn with ten of the twelve months showing yoy growth. One of those that didn’t was December. There are three inter-related indicators here.

Appetite is there from AI businesses: Six US raises, all of AI businesses, raised $93.5bn, 40% of the US total in 2025 (Open AI $40bn, Anthropic $15bn and $13bn, Scale AI $14.3bn, Project Prometheus $6.2bn, xAI $5bn).

For the outturn in 2026 to exceed 2025 it will depend on a clutch of similar big raises. Already xAI has announced a $20bn raise at the start of 2026. OpenAI is reported by the WSJ to be seeking a raise of as much as $100bn. Tether is said to be looking at a $18.5bn raise and Waymo at $15bn. On that basis the 2026 US fund raising total has the potential to exceed that of 2025.

Will these be Growth Equity deals or IPOs? The FT reported at the very start of this year that OpenAI, Anthropic and SpaceX ‘are working on listings expected to raise tens of billions of dollars in proceeds.’ It’s arguably semantics but IPOs would shift them from the growth equity to the public bracket. OpenAI is said to be looking at valuations of $750bn, SpaceX at $800bn and Anthropic at c$300bn. Databricks – which raised $4bn in 2025 may also translate to the public markets with a c$135bn valuation targeted.

Is there an AI bubble? Clearly these businesses are not conventionally valued. Open AI’s Sam Altman has talked about $20bn of annualised revenue towards the end of 2025 (Source: The Information) and has talked about reaching $100bn annualised perhaps as early as 2027 and ‘hundreds of billions’ by 2030. Assuming that implies c$300bn by 2025 it would make OpenAI about twice the size of Meta (2024 revenue c$165bn). Sam Altman has stated that ‘You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center build outs in the not-too-distant future’ and most external estimates anticipate c$1.4 trillion in data center and compute requirements in the next few years.

This heavy capex load, although perhaps shared with partners, is a key concern for markets, flying in the face of the typically capex light model that has supported the growth of the major tech stocks. If OpenAI can reach a valuation of $850bn in its next round, that is 42.5x end 2025 ARR, perhaps c8.5x start 2027 ARR and 2.6x 2030 ARR. By comparison Meta trades at c8.5x 2026 EV/revenue. The growth rates of Open AI are much higher; the profitability is obviously much lower.

And the applications of AI and the associated industries, autonomous vehicles, AI drug discovery, robotics, legal tech, software coding, cybersecurity, defense etc are still in the foothills of development.

So, our answer for the US market is yes – a further increase in the total sums raised in growth equity in 2026 – but it will be close.

Europe: An easier answer here. AI was less of a factor in market growth in 2025 - with AI only the second largest category of raises at $5.27bn, behind Software at $7.5bn. Nor has the European market grown as dramatically – its low was $31.8bn in 2022 – the 2025 level was just 55% higher at $49.2bn and just 23% higher than 2022’s $39.7bn. Looking at the shape of the year, growth was modest in H1 2025 – just 23% while in H2 it was 66%. We think the momentum- helped by lower valuations as investor interest spills out of the US – will see the total of raises grow again in 2026.

2. The sectors to look out for

Of course, we expect AI to dominate again. Looking beyond the LLMs there are three areas to highlight:

Defense: An obvious one perhaps but it was only the sixth largest VC raise category in the US in 2025 with $7.2bn raised and the ninth biggest in Europe with c$1.7bn raised. The trends are all in its favour – heightened political tension around Ukraine, Venezuela, Greenland and the other flashpoints of the world, the JD Vance Munich speech which pushes the onus for European defence onto the shoulders of European countries and has them scrambling to raise the percentage of GDP committed to defence to 5% while new technologies and methods of conducting warfare are offering an opportunity to young, VC backed tech led companies to take a disproportionate share of this new spending from the traditional platform led defence contractors. VC investment in defence companies is accelerating, and the trend appears likely to keep gathering pace as the world adapts to the new reality of heightened geopolitical tension and the realisation that regions, like Europe, will need to shoulder more of the burden and cost of their own defence rather than relying on the US.

Crypto and Blockchain: Crypto went out of style following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the charges against Binance and its founder which led to convictions in November 2023 plus a supporting cast of bankruptcies and mishaps at the likes of Three Arrows Capital, Genesis Global, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network, Bittrex, and ComputeNorth.

The industry has recovered its poise post these vicissitudes under the umbrella of a more crypto friendly US administration and one of the features of 2025 was the accelerating pace of growth equity deals for crypto businesses. In Q4 there were five US deals in crypto and blockchain raising $2.1bn. Leading these was the $800m raise led by Jane Street for the crypto exchange Kraken executed at a $20bn valuation. A substantial Series A raise for Layer 1 blockchain business Tempo was led by Greenoaks and Thrive Capital, valued the business at $5bn and was supported by the financial infrastructure and payment processing business Stripe and the crypto investment firm Paradigm. The two big prediction market players Polymarket and Kalshi raised $3.3bn between them in Q4 2025. These are blockchain marketplaces. Polymarket, for instance, runs on Polygon blockchain technology using the USDC cryptocurrency. Every trade is matched peer-to-peer through smart contracts.

Long gestation businesses: Quantum, Fusion, Nuclear: Less a sector and more an investment style. These are businesses reliant on the growth of AI but not tied to it – the picks and shovels of the AI industry. We exclude data centres themselves as too closely tied to the short-term development of the AI phenomenon. Nuclear and fusion are about supplying the long-term energy needs of AI and transforming the means of delivery to allow its growth. Quantum computing techniques are the next frontier for the processing of AI and the shift to AGI. In each case venture is fulfilling its true function – to provide early-stage capital to high risk but potentially transformative businesses.

3. Realisations – will they improve in 2026?

Fundraising trends for VC firms were at a low ebb in 2025. There was the beginning of an upturn in the IPO market and a more noticeable upturn in M&A. Nevertheless, the flow of capital around the system remains stunted with the depressed levels of VC fundraising and its increased concentration in big funds reflective of the limited scale of realisations.

One of the key trends has been the ‘private for longer’ syndrome amongst big private companies reflective of a depressed IPO market, the easier availability of substantial amounts of long term private capital in some industries ( Anthropic raised $13bn in September 2025, $15bn in November 2025 and is currently raising another $10bn), the perception that value will grow rapidly and should not be crystallised too early combined with the growth of the secondary market to allow some necessary liquidity for staff and shareholders.

2026 then will be an interesting test of the strength of the public markets. There are certainly plenty of candidates. The CrunchBase Unicorn Board Growth chart below shows that at the end of 2025 it counted 1,640 unicorns which have collectively raised $1,160bn and which are collectively valued at $6,980bn. The key test will be whether the likes of Open AI, Space X and Anthropic move to IPO and the percentage of the equity that is made available to public markets or whether these companies decide that a ‘private for longer’ approach can be sustained.

UK & International Qualifications benefited from volume, pricing, and International growth. Sales growth accelerated in Q4, with sales up 8%, driven by new contract launches in Pearson Professional Assessments and the return to growth in US Student Assessment as phasing normalised.

Virtual Learning sales increased 8% for the full year with strong performance in H2. Sales increased 20% in Q4, driven by a 13% increase in 2025/26 academic year enrolments in the Fall semester, favourable mix and funding.

Higher Education sales were up 2% for the full year and flat in Q4. US Higher Education sales grew 3% for the full year, driven by enrolments and pricing in our core Courseware business, partly offset by K-12 declines given the transitionary period, with adoption share maintained. In the year, there was growth of 1% in US digital subscriptions and 19% in Inclusive Access. International Higher Education faced ongoing challenging trading conditions in mature markets, declining 7% for the full year.

English Language Learning sales grew 1% for the full year driven by Institutional. Pearson Test of English (PTE) sales were flat, performing well against a tough market backdrop. Sales growth accelerated in Q4 to 8%, driven by a strong performance in Institutional, particularly in key Latin American markets and Asia, partially offset by expected declines in PTE following volume strength ahead of test enhancements in Q3.

Enterprise Learning & Skills sales grew 6% for the full year and 13% in Q4, with a solid performance in Vocational Qualifications and continued quarter-on-quarter improvement in Enterprise Solutions, driven by the recently announced partnerships.

Strong financial position

Pearson's financial position remains robust, with a strong balance sheet, net debt of c.£1.1bn and a 2025 free cash flow conversion of more than 95%1 plus recovery of the £0.1bn in relation to State Aid taxes.

Medium Term Outlook unchanged

Beyond 2025, Pearson is positioned to deliver a mid-single digit underlying sales growth CAGR, sustained margin improvement that will equate to an average increase of 40 basis points per annum and strong free cash conversion1, in the region of 90% to 100%, on average, across the period.

Financial calendar

Full year results will be announced on 27 February 2026. We will hold an in-person presentation and Q&A session, during which we will outline the 2026 outlook.

Financial summary

Underlying growth for the fourth quarter and financial year ended 31 December 2025 compared to the equivalent period in 2024.

The Creator Studio package is the best value for creators who use more than one of these apps and who split their time between the Mac and iPhone/iPad versions.
Apple also allows up to six people to share a single Creator Studio subscription via Family Sharing.","Apple’s professional creative apps have been slower to jump on the subscription bandwagon than those from Adobe or some of its other competitors, but the company is taking a step in that direction today. Starting on January 28, Apple will offer an Apple Creator Studio subscription for $13 a month, or $130 a year. Subscribers will get access to the Mac and (where applicable) iPad versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, as well as “intelligent features and premium content” for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone versions of Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform.

Apple says it will also offer a one-month free trial for the subscription and a discounted version for students at $3 a month, or $30 a year.

Most of the apps also seem to be getting small feature updates to go along with the Creator Studio announcement. Final Cut will get a new Transcript Search feature that will allow you to dig through video footage by searching for specific dialogue, and a new Montage Maker feature “will analyze and edit together a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage.” An updated Logic Pro “helps creators deliver original music for their video content” and adds a synth player to the app’s lineup of “AI Session Players.”

The biggest update is probably a new version of Pixelmator Pro for the iPad, designed around the Apple Pencil accessory. When Apple announced it was acquiring Pixelmator in late 2024, the image and vector editing app was only available for the Mac.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers—in another lifetime, the apps formerly known as “iWork""—the core apps remain free, but the Creator Studio subscription adds “premium templates and themes” for the apps, as well as access to a Content Hub that provides “curated, high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations” for the apps. Apple is also offering a handful of OpenAI-powered generative features, including upscaling and transformation for existing images, the ability to generate images from text, and a Keynote feature that will create a slide deck from a text outline.

Standalone Mac apps are still available

Unlike Adobe, Apple doesn’t offer lower-end subscription tiers that only give you access to individual apps. The Creator Studio package is the best value for creators who use more than one of these apps and who split their time between the Mac and iPhone/iPad versions. Anyone else will inevitably be paying for at least a handful of things you don’t use.

Apple’s subscription prices look reasonable based on what you would pay for an all-access subscription to Adobe’s Creative Cloud apps, though Adobe’s apps also cover web design, photo editing, and some other use cases that Apple’s subscription doesn’t—$780 a year, $105 a month, or $70 a month if you pay for one year’s subscription a month at a time. Apple also allows up to six people to share a single Creator Studio subscription via Family Sharing.

The good news for people who only want one or two apps (or who have already bought the apps, or who simply don’t want yet another subscription) is that the Mac versions of Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage remain available as standalone App Store purchases. Often, when apps shift to a subscription model, it means the standalone perpetually licensed versions go away—Adobe hasn’t offered standalone versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, or its other apps since 2013.

The iPad versions of the apps, including Pixelmator Pro, appear to be subscription-only. Each of the apps has slightly different system requirements, all outlined in a long list of footnotes at the bottom of Apple’s announcement.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio-lifestyle-Final-Cut-Pro-1152x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 00:12:55.322567

The couple relocated to Austin from Silicon Valley in 2020, and Coxe is also a part-owner of Austin FC.
“Having spent my career backing strong leaders, meeting Claudia made it clear: Supporting the vision for the UT medical center is exactly the opportunity Austin needed,” Coxe said.
In September 2025, Coxe gifted 1 million Nvidia shares, valued at more than $168 million, to undisclosed recipients, Bloomberg reported.
“One of the things that happens with bigger gifts is that it de-risks it a bit for some people,” Simone said.","The donation, one of the largest gifts in the university’s history, was driven by the couple’s personal history and values aligning with the university’s goal of improving healthcare access in Central Texas, where they live.

The medical center will include a new hospital to treat complex and serious conditions and an expansion of the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, according to a statement from the university. It is expected to open in 2030.

“I hope in 25 years that people will say that UT has one of the best medical centers in the world, and it’s benefiting the whole community,” Coxe said in a video.

Coxe was managing director of Sutter Hill Ventures from 1989 to 2020, and joined the Nvidia board in 1993, an early supporter of Jensen Huang. Coxe is the third largest individual shareholder of Nvidia, behind founder Huang and board member and venture capitalist Mark Stevens, and has an estimated net worth of $7.7 billion, according to Forbes.

The couple relocated to Austin from Silicon Valley in 2020, and Coxe is also a part-owner of Austin FC. They are also Democratic supporters, and each donated $1 million to Beto O’Rourke’s 2022 gubernatorial campaign against Gov. Greg Abbott.

Investing in the future of healthcare

The couple’s personal experiences also influenced their choice to donate to the University of Texas. Their six-year-old son successfully underwent treatment for Burkitt lymphoma at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford Medicine in 2003, which inspired them to pay it forward, Simone said. They also saw the need for more healthcare infrastructure in their own community.

“We have a close friend who had to travel to Houston [from Austin] for care she should have been able to get here at home,” Coxe said. As much as 25% of people in the region leave the area to seek care for serious medical needs, according to the university.

A key part of the Coxes’ decision to donate was speaking with the dean of UT’s Dell Medical School, Claudia Lucchinetti, and hearing her vision to change the model of healthcare by integrating university research with a modern healthcare system.

“Having spent my career backing strong leaders, meeting Claudia made it clear: Supporting the vision for the UT medical center is exactly the opportunity Austin needed,” Coxe said. The gift is unrestricted and the university says they will prioritize hiring world-class staff, construction, technology investments, and expanding access to healthcare.

The couple typically gives quietly or anonymously. In September 2025, Coxe gifted 1 million Nvidia shares, valued at more than $168 million, to undisclosed recipients, Bloomberg reported.

“One of the things that happens with bigger gifts is that it de-risks it a bit for some people,” Simone said. “Our approach to philanthropy is to invest and believe, knowing that there’s a risk and not everything’s going to be perfect. We hope by making this gift, we can help encourage others to take that same view.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICM-Simone_Tench_Coxe-1890x1068-1.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-13 23:13:50.712337

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate.
So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when U.S. Bancorp (USB) reports results for the quarter ended December 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 20, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.2%.

Revenues are expected to be $7.33 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.46% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?

For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.78%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.22, delivering a surprise of +9.91%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

U.S. Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Expected Results of an Industry Player

Among the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), is soon expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share for the quarter ended December 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.46 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for M&T Bank has been revised 0.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of +0.54%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.

When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that M&T Bank will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.

Transcript

[00:00:00] Veronica: Hello, and welcome to The Quantum Spin by HKA. I’m Veronica Combs. I’m a writer and an editor here at the agency. I get to talk every day with really smart people working on really fascinating subjects, everything in the Quantum industry, from hardware to software. On our podcast, we focus in on quantum communication, and by that I don’t mean making networks safe from hacking or entangling photons over long distance, but talking about the technology.

[00:00:26] How do you explain these complicated concepts to people who don’t have a background in science and engineering but want to understand all the same?

[00:00:34] Today I’m talking with Katia Moskvitch, who is the founder of “The Quantum Kid” podcast. She is a STEM communicator and a physicist. Thank you so much for joining us today, Katia.

[00:00:44] Katia: Of course, pleasure to be here.

[00:00:47] Veronica: I appreciate you taking time for another podcast since you’ve got your own production schedule that you’re running.

[00:00:51] You do The Quantum Kid with your son Kai, and he is a full co-host in the podcast, and it’s super fun to watch him ask questions with all of your guests. How did you get started with that project?

[00:01:04] Katia: Yeah, it just happened. He has been interested in STEM, in math and engineering and technology in general, ever since he was, I don’t know, about six years old, he started programming in Python all, all on his own. Actually, even before that, he was asking me to find him a coding school when he was five, and I was absolutely unable to find him a coding school at the age of five because nobody would even accept him at that time.

[00:01:29] And then, so he had to wait a little bit longer, and at six they finally accepted him into a coding camp first, and then like a proper after school class. So yeah, it kind of started from there. He started watching CrunchLabs on YouTube, which is this engineering show for kids. Then he begged me to subscribe him to CrunchLabs.

[00:01:51] So he actually gets the parcels in, in the mail and he asks for programmable Lego as well so that he could program it on his computer. And then he asked for a 3D printer. So anyway, all of this kind of over the past three years and got me thinking, you know, maybe we could channel all that curiosity into something more and like kind of open it up for other people as well because he’s asking all these questions and I can answer them to some extent, but sometimes his questions are quite complicated. And I’ve been talking about quantum quite a lot at home.

[00:02:23] And so he started asking about quantum computing too. And then I thought, okay, since I work in that area, why don’t I ask him whether he would like to have a show together. And he said

[00:02:35] absolutely. So he was super thrilled because he loves YouTube. He is a chatterbox anyway, he talks a lot all the time.

[00:02:42] So we tried it out and he was a little bit shy at first because of course he doesn’t know those grownups that pop up on the screen. And he’s not used to virtual meetings or anything like that. But it worked out fine. The first two guests were actually his uncle, my brother.

[00:02:59] And so that made it easier. And the second guest was on the same show. It was a really, really lovely professor at ETH Zurich University who just explained everything in a very engaging manner, and Kai was super interested and that particular episode proved to be the most popular one to date.

[00:03:18] We got something like 50,000 plus views and I don’t know, 50,000 subscribers just from that one episode. And it just shows if the person explains such complex science in a very engaging way, and it’s interesting and accessible to even nine year olds, and clearly also to the wider world.

[00:03:39] And Kai loves it. He was like, oh, I’m a YouTube influencer now.

[00:03:42] Veronica: Every kid’s dream.

[00:03:44] Katia: really. Exactly. So he’s happy.

[00:03:46] Veronica: Yeah, you can tell that he is really into it. I mean, you can’t fake enthusiasm and he’s, his questions are so good and you describe him this way. Kai asked questions in a way, only a kid can, without overthinking it and without the worry of having to look smart and knowledgeable.

[00:04:03] And he reminded me, as I was watching the podcast and listening to him converse with your guests, of that person in the meeting who, everyone’s wanting to ask this one question, but no one is willing to ask it. But then someone finally gets the courage to just say, well, what does this mean?

[00:04:16] Or why are we doing it this way? So, how do you prepare for an episode with him? Do you let him pick the topics or is it a collaboration?

[00:04:23] Katia: It depends. For example, the first two topics, I suggested them, simply because he is very new to quantum, right? And so for him, even the word optimization, I had to explain what optimization is.

[00:04:38] And manufacturing is the same, right? He didn’t know what manufacturing meant. That’s our second topic. So I had to explain it, whatever is being made at factories. Like you can put it in plain English, right? And then he gets it. But then he comes up with questions as we go along and I mean the only bit of preparation that is needed really, actually two bits.

[00:04:55] One, we usually rehearse the intro a little bit because that has to be engaging and we usually get it from the second or third take. And secondly, I typically need to give super clear instructions to the guests because they’re, even though there is a kid in front of them on the screen, they really need to be in the mindset that they’re talking to a child and shouldn’t forget that that’s a small child listening to them, because otherwise he’ll just drift off and he won’t be engaged or, or listening or asking more questions.

[00:05:26] So then what’s the point? Right? But to some extent they all engage with him specifically. So they address him and they talk to him. And then of course, if they’re talking to him and they’re explaining it to him, then he’s much more keen to continue asking questions and actually listening and understanding.

[00:05:42] Veronica: Yeah, you could tell. I think it was, maybe it was that first episode where you were talking about, I think space and you could tell he had worked out this scenario of, I have a spaceship and I want us to do this, and it’s going to land here and it’s going to collect this data.

[00:05:54] And you could tell that he’s building products and prototypes in his mind, obviously, as he goes along.

[00:06:01] Katia: Exactly. Yeah.

[00:06:02] Veronica: So the format of the show is really compelling. I found I think, when you say the quantum kid, you think, oh, it’s going to be over here in the States or Sesame Street, which is, the letter of the day, the number of the day and things like that.

[00:06:12] But each show you have a quantum expert and a business leader. And as you mentioned, you’re talking about complex topics, not just physics, but manufacturing and production. Your own professional network seems to be pretty deep and you’ve found pretty, pretty cool people to talk with. How do you pick your guests?

[00:06:30] Katia: The idea of the podcast is to have a quantum expert, and that could be either somebody, a professor from academia or somebody from the industry, a researcher from the industry like IBM or Google, doesn’t matter, as long as they know the topic, and I tend to research a little bit. Either I know that they’re a good speaker or they’ve, had presentations before that are online and I can see that they could be really, really great. Of course we try to get fairly well-known people. For example, one of our next shows, we’re going to have Peter Shor with us, so he’s

[00:07:05] Veronica: oh my gosh. Wow.

[00:07:07] Katia: A really huge name in quantum computing and I’m really thrilled that he agreed to be on the show. So, hopefully that will go well, and will be interesting. In terms of the second guest business leader, that is really more difficult actually, because my network is in, in quantum, and here we need to get somebody

[00:07:28] from a field where quantum is expected to make quite a huge impact, but not necessarily somebody who’s already working with quantum because the idea of the show is that that person, the second person, is also asking questions and is also kind of learning from the quantum experts through the answers that the quantum expert is giving to a child.

[00:07:51] Because that’s kind of a lot more accessible and easier to understand for that particular person on the line, plus hopefully to all the other business leaders trying to learn about the benefits of quantum computing for this particular industry field. So that is not easy for a variety of reasons because people who are not in quantum, it’s notoriously difficult to get them excited,

[00:08:15] get them to understand why quantum computing would be of use to them. So we got my brother on the line and he is super far from quantum computing, but he’s very excited about innovation in general. He’s a patent lawyer and so one would think that for a patent lawyer, quantum computing wouldn’t be a thing at all, but actually it will impact that as well.

[00:08:37] And he was asking questions like, for example, he likes to invest in promising technologies. Would quantum computing be something that he could invest in already today? And so our guest then answered those questions, so that was great.

[00:08:53] We spoke to a guy, an owner of quite a large baking business in Eastern Europe and he’s got several factories. So one might think that quantum computing definitely will be of use to his business because of the supply chain optimization and picking the right ingredients or playing with different ingredients and so on.

[00:09:16] So there are. Definitely benefits that one may think of, but that particular person just said, no, I don’t think it’s for me, it’s definitely not something I would consider even talking about. So that discussion went nowhere and we had to look for different guests. So it’s not so easy to find people right now who are outside of my immediate quantum bubble where everybody’s super excited and everybody goes to the same conference and everybody knows everybody. But once you’re out of that bubble and like even at my kids’ parents meetings at schools, people are professionals. People are super clever and knowledgeable, but they just don’t know the first thing about quantum.

[00:09:56] Not yet.

[00:09:56] Veronica: Yes. We found too that, there is some that, some hesitancy. There is the, there’s only a small group of people outside of quantum, as you said, that know about the technology or that are willing to talk about it. But even the ones doing some experimenting seem a little hesitant.

[00:10:09] And I’m hoping that all this money that’s flowing into the industry and this higher profile, maybe will help more people be willing to learn about it and talk about it. Yeah, sure. But there’s so much going on in Europe right now. You’re based in Zurich, is that right?

[00:10:22] Katia: That’s right.

[00:10:23] Veronica: I’ve talked to some folks from QuantumBasel and the University of Basel and there’s just so many startups all over the place.

[00:10:30]

[00:10:30] Veronica: So you are a STEM communicator, as I mentioned, and you’ve worked for Wired Magazine.

[00:10:34] You worked for IBM, I think you worked for the World Economic Forum for a little while. So you are obviously a practiced communicator and know how to explain complex topics. What are the communications best practices that you’ve learned over the years?

[00:10:48] Katia: Well, in journalism what they teach you from the beginning is you have to know how to ask questions and you have to show the utmost respect to whoever you’re talking to, that if you don’t understand the question.

[00:11:04] Then you should just ask the question again and again in different ways, in subtle ways, so that you finally get what the answer is. Because especially in science it’s super important. If I don’t understand the explanation, how, even if I record it, how am I going to explain it to my audience? So I need to be

[00:11:23] clear and the explanation should be super, free of jargon even for me at that first instance of just recording the interview. So I ask the question a little bit differently and then a little bit differently until I finally get it, but in a way so that the person doesn’t feel like I’m a dumb, dumb sitting in front of them, and why am I wasting their time?

[00:11:44] So that would probably be the number one thing.

[00:11:47] Yeah, that’s a good skill to have.

[00:11:49] Veronica: Yes.

[00:11:49] So, “The Quantum Kid” podcast is certainly educational for everyone and it’s a fun format. It’s very dynamic. You have your son there asking really good questions. We are always encouraging here at the agency, at HKA Marketing Communications, we’re always encouraging companies to do educational content because the learning curve can be steep for quantum and there’s just not a lot out there comparing modalities, explaining some of the basic concepts.

[00:12:16] Have you had any luck persuading companies that educational content is valuable at this point in the industry?

[00:12:24] Katia: Are you talking about quantum companies or just any companies trying to learn quantum?

[00:12:30] Veronica: Any companies trying to explain a difficult topic?

[00:12:33] Katia: When we talk about quantum computing hardware developers, there are several companies I would say several.

[00:12:41] I would say, a few, probably, that do have educational content, which is pretty good. IBM is probably number one in that they have really good educational content in quantum. Then there are a few others like IonQ. They also have really nice documentation. There’s Google of course. And a few others.

[00:12:58] Quantinuum has some, but yeah, not everybody has good educational content for sure. And I agree with you that in terms of resources, there should be way more. So this is actually why, for example, me personally when I started the podcast, that’s just the first stepping stone to a larger educational initiative.

[00:13:18] The second thing that we are launching right now will be educational webinars on how to program a quantum computer. That’s part of our kind of broader educational initiative called Tesseract Quantum.

[00:13:30] And the webinars will also be monthly and for now hosted on the same YouTube channel where we have The Quantum Kid. And we’ll go from there because I agree with you that there is just not much out there and I’m talking to universities. I’m also thinking how to, probably in the future even create, better educational material like that, maybe even courses or something, because I think we definitely need online courses for professionals that wouldn’t be a fullblown, master’s or PhD degree, where you would have to spend, two years, three years, four years of your life full time. If you’re like 30, 40, 50 years old and you would like to dive deeper into quantum, you definitely don’t want to spend four years of your life again and then go back to university. So what we need is those flexible online courses that you can just do over six months or so but not every day. For instance, I did a course at LSC, London School of Economics, on management and leadership.

[00:14:29] And there are plenty of courses like that and that’s great. So I think we need to do something similar in quantum that doesn’t exist yet. There are a few courses for professionals available, MIT xPRO offers a course and, but again, it’s only four weeks, so that one is actually, probably better than others, but a few other courses I’ve come across, they’re all either two days long or one week long.

[00:14:51] What can you possibly learn? You cannot become a quantum algorithm designer, for example in a week, right? So you need something more substantial. And I think we have a long way to go, but one way to achieve it would be to get policy makers to do something on a national strategy level.

[00:15:08] And then they could change the high school curricula, introduce quantum early. They could incentivize companies to actually do what you just mentioned. Actually think about their workforce development and upskilling much more carefully. But without governments stepping in and doing something I think it’ll be very difficult.

[00:15:27] Veronica: And I think there’s that end of the educational spectrum, but there’s also just catching people’s attention. And that’s why The Quantum Kid is such a great addition to the podcast world because people are so overloaded with information and you need a hook to

[00:15:41] help them understand how powerful quantum hopefully will be and just how fascinating the subject is and how many people are working on it around the world. So, hopefully The Quantum Kid podcast could be that initial hook and then draw them into the more specific educational projects like you mentioned.

[00:15:58] Katia: If you want to see Kai, I can get him here as well.

[00:16:03] Veronica: Oh yeah, sure. It’d be great.

[00:16:03] [00:16:04] Hello. Hello, Kai. It’s very nice to meet you, podcast host. You ask really good questions. I have to say. I’ve been asking questions for a job for a long time, and you’re very good at it.

[00:16:15] Kai: Thank you.

[00:16:16] Veronica: Is it fun to do with your mom most of the time?

[00:16:19] Kai: Yeah.

[00:16:23] Katia: Why quantum? Quantum? Why do you like it?

[00:16:26] Kai: It does because it can do so many things.

[00:16:31] Katia: Do stuff fast.

[00:16:32] Kai: Do stuff fast.

[00:16:34] Veronica: And you’re coding, right? Yeah. Python is the language to know, man, you’re getting a jump on everybody. I was talking to a person who hires quantum engineers or mechanical engineers for a quantum company and she said, Python, Rust, C++,

[00:16:49] those are the languages to know. So getting a jump on things.

[00:16:52] Katia: Yeah.

[00:16:53] Veronica: Thank you for saying hi. I have kids myself and I think it’s very cool that you’re doing this with your mom. Thanks for saying hi. I appreciate it.

[00:16:59] Kai: Okay. Thank you. Bye bye.

[00:17:04] Veronica: My kids are 16 and 21, so I miss the 9-year-old days.

[00:17:08] Katia: Oh yeah. It’s not always that cute, huh?

[00:17:10] Veronica: Yeah. This is true. Those days have faded. So, you were the head of communications in Europe for IBM Research and you’re an IBM Quantum Ambassador. What was it like to work with such a big company doing such amazing work in quantum?

[00:17:25] Katia: Yeah, it was great. My work was not fully on quantum all the time, because communications, of course, especially at IBM, it’s also AI. I worked at IBM Research, it was very exciting because it was all about the new research that is coming out of the lab. And we had to talk about it to the media and do media events and amplify it and, and so on and so forth.

[00:17:49] But specifically quantum was super exciting. We had a lot of really interesting projects like, launching the first European data center, for example, in Germany and just working in general with super smart quantum researchers and talking to them, getting the story out, understanding how to tell that story to a wider audience through log writing or even, while talking to the media.

[00:18:12] So that was, that was great. IBM is doing some really great stuff and I am really pleased that they are pushing ahead with the milestones in quantum computing. And I think it takes a lot of self-awareness and trust in yourself and in your company, your team to publicly declare the roadmap.

[00:18:32] And IBM has done it. And they’re hitting those milestones pretty consistently on the quantum roadmap. They said that they’re going to achieve quantum advantage by 2029, I believe. And so that’s like four years from now. So it’s very, very soon. And yeah, that’s super exciting.

[00:18:49] Veronica: Yes, I do really like their roadmap because they do spell things out and set goals, but then they also have an asterisk too, where we’re still working on this. It’s a way to be sort of honest about the challenges. It’s not easy to, build these machines and but it is good to, to get a date out there and to

[00:19:06] show your work. I use that roadmap a lot when talking with clients in terms of: you don’t want too much detail, but you want enough and you want to look ambitious, but not impossible.

[00:19:15] So one other communication challenge that we have a lot is getting people to think beyond just words. Obviously words are very important. and you need to, when you’re writing a scientific paper, you have to be precise and, explain and explain your work.

[00:19:29] But sometimes you do need something more informal, a blog post or a podcast. Did you have much experience in getting people to try a new format? It’s a little intimidating to get in front of the camera. Was that part of your work at IBM getting people to tell their stories in different ways?

[00:19:44] Katia: We usually knew who would be more comfortable on camera or for example, presenting in front of journalists for say, a media event or something like that. So there is also media training is very important and I think anyone can really get media trained if they really want to.

[00:20:00] Leadership is usually more experienced than researchers. But sometimes researchers also need to be out there a little bit more. One example that stands out is about a very specific researcher whom I met when I started working at IBM.

[00:20:15] And. I knew that whenever he would give a talk, he would give super technical talks. And so whenever we would have media coming to the lab, his talks also would tend to be a little bit more on the technical side, simply because he was so used to it.

[00:20:31] But journalists, of course, very often, can be completely clueless, right? Because they may be covering business and to them the actual underlying science in quantum is something that they don’t normally talk about because they just talk about the business side, or, they may cover policy. It’s difficult for them to understand super technical topics and so on.

[00:20:50] So that particular person, it was difficult to get him to change the way he was presenting. But once he had a conversation with my kid, my older son, who is now 17, and at the time he was I think 11 or 12, and he had one of those, we had one of those bring your kid to work days. He came with me and he loves math, so he really wanted to talk to a researcher about mathematics and career in mathematics. And so I thought about this guy, so I asked, would you please sit down with my son over lunch for half an hour?

[00:21:20] And talk to him because yeah, he wants to know what career path to choose in the future. He loves maths, but he’s not sure. And the guy said, yeah, of course. And then I went to get a coffee or something and I’m coming back five minutes later, and I see them talking to each other.

[00:21:35] My older son, he’s the complete opposite from Kai. He’s actually more of an introvert. He doesn’t engage so easily with people, not straight away anyway, and he’s there sitting with this guy, with this researcher, and the researcher is talking to him about complex mathematics in such an engaging way that my kid is like all, his face lit up, he was asking questions, he was interested.

[00:21:58] It was unbelievable. And so both of them really enjoyed it, and it continued for way more than half an hour. After that I spoke to the researcher and I said, look, could you maybe use some of that enthusiasm in how you talk to my son when you talk to journalists? Because they are just on the same level as my kid here.

[00:22:18] And he thought about it and he was like, oh yeah, that’s a good idea. And so he changed the way he was approaching presentations whenever media would be around, and his presentations naturally became super different from before. Wow. And that was like, it wasn’t even media training, right?

[00:22:34] It was just kind of getting him to understand and to relate to specific experiences that he lived through. And it really, really worked. So I think it can work with anybody really.

[00:22:44] Veronica: Wow, that’s a great story. So your kids have been helping scientists communicate for, for several years now in format,

[00:22:51] Katia: I guess.

[00:22:52] I guess so. I never thought about connecting these to episodes, but yeah, I guess you’re right.

[00:22:57] Veronica: Do you have any advice for quantum CEOs who want to raise the profile of their company and get more people aware of their work?

[00:23:03] Katia: Of course communications and marketing, these are the two things that are super important, but it depends how you do them.

[00:23:10] I think in marketing one shouldn’t over hype and only talk about their own product. I think we are still at the stage in quantum computing where yes, it’s about the business, it’s about selling products for sure. But if we want the world to be ready for quantum advantage specifically, then we need to also talk about education and as you said, spark that curiosity as well.

[00:23:33] So I think that should be one big part of the outreach agenda of companies. So to go a little bit beyond just selling the product, but actually exciting people about quantum and teaching them how to use, how to get those quantum computing skills, and just understanding what it is all about, understanding the benefits.

[00:23:54] Veronica: So you said you have Tesseract Quantum coming up a new show on your YouTube channel and the podcast is brand new, but you’ve already got lots of subscribers, so that’s amazing.

[00:24:04] And do you do two a month or one a month? Is that your schedule? Do you have that sorted out yet?

[00:24:09] Katia: For now, we do one a month simply because I don’t want to overload Kai. I don’t think he would be super happy to do two a month. That’s why we are starting the webinars. And the webinars will be kind of in addition to, to the podcast.

[00:24:22] And that will be the second thing per month.

[00:24:25] Veronica: Yes. Well, It’s a lot of work to put a show together and to, to make it good and so yeah, gotta pace yourself for sure.

[00:24:31] Katia: Absolutely.

[00:24:32] Veronica: Well, thank you so much for talking with us today. Your show is “The Quantum Kid” and you and your son Kai host it, and we will certainly join your subscribers and encourage all of our listeners to do the same. So thanks so much for your time today.

[00:24:45] Katia: Great. All right. Well, Thank you.

Shares of creative software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell 5.4% in the afternoon session after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock, adding to a growing chorus of concerns that the rise of Artificial Intelligence could hurt the company's business.

Oppenheimer lowered its rating on the software giant to ""market perform"" from ""outperform."" This move followed a recent downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which moved the stock to a ""Sell"" rating from ""Buy."" Analysts expressed worries that generative AI was making high-end design tools too accessible, increasing competitive pressure from AI-focused firms like Canva, Figma, and OpenAI.

This skepticism marked the most pessimistic outlook from financial analysts for Adobe in over a decade. The concerns centered on the potential for slowing revenue growth and pressure on earnings, especially if Adobe needed to increase its own AI investments to compete.

The shares closed the day at $310.02, down 5.4% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Adobe’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 10 months ago when the stock dropped 13.2% on the news that the company reported underwhelming fourth-quarter (fiscal Q1 2025) results, as remaining performance obligations (RPO - leading growth indicator) fell slightly short of analysts' estimates.

That, plus the fact that full-year (fiscal 2025) revenue and EPS guidance were just in line with estimates, signaled a lack of near-term momentum. Wall Street likes to see companies beat and raise, and this wasn't impressive. Adding to the weakness, growth trudged along in the quarter rather than accelerate. Overall, this quarter was mixed. The stock's reaction suggested markets were expecting more.

Adobe is down 6.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $310.83 per share, it is trading 33% below its 52-week high of $464.11 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Adobe’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $658.47.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/adobe-cover-image-NTFexPkM.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 22:13:14.575300

The Commerce Department said the chips can be shipped to China granted that there is sufficient supply of the processors in the US.

President Donald Trump said last month that he would allow the chip sales to ""approved customers"" in China and collect a 25% fee.

Nvidia's spokesperson told the BBC that the company welcomed the move, saying it will benefit manufacturing and jobs in the US.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said its revised export policy applies to Nvidia's H200 chips, as well as less advanced processors. Chinese customers must also show ""sufficient security procedures"" and cannot use the chips for military uses.

The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.

Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the ""politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues"".

""We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,"" he said. ""This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.""

Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.

Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.

Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was designed to bolster China's tech industry, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.

Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually lobbied Washington to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.

Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.

While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.

Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.

Trump's ""unique"" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.

""It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3a62/live/f45e8fa0-f0da-11f0-a29c-c32ead86fb16.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 23:13:55.183557

Lilly Confident in Obesity Pill Supply, Doubles Down on AI With Nvidia Pact

With an FDA approval expected in the coming months, Eli Lilly remains confident that its supply chain can handle a coordinated global launch for its closely watched weight-loss pill orforglipron. Chief Scientific and Product Officer Daniel Skovronsky told Reuters at JPM that the pharma plans to “launch in many, many countries . . . as quickly as possible.”

In November last year, the FDA awarded orforglipron its Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher, which shortens the review period to 1–2 months, down from the usual 10–12 months. Analysts expect an approval by March 2026. Lilly plans to sell the drug at $150 per month, Skovronsky told Reuters. “We’ve spent billions of dollars in science here, and tens of billions of dollars to build factories to make this. Then we’re offering it at Starbucks pricing.”

Also at JPM, Lilly unveiled a partnership with AI leader Nvidia to launch a co-innovation lab that will leverage machine learning to address some of the biggest challenges in pharma.

Compounders Continue to Hound Novo

While Lilly painted a rosy picture for its obesity portfolio, fellow weight-loss leader Novo Nordisk reported that compounded and unapproved versions of its GLP-1 drugs continue to eat into its revenues.

At a panel at JPM, CEO Mike Doustdar estimated that around 1.5 million U.S. patients are using compounded versions of Wegovy and Ozempic, Reuters reported, highlighting how drug pricing can heavily influence consumers. These patients don’t actively seek out unapproved and unsafe compounded drugs, Doustdar insisted. Rather, compounders “grabbed a part of the consumers that simply were price sensitive.”

The CEO said Novo is learning the lessons of its compounding problem and will apply these to its patient engagement and pricing strategies moving forward, according to Reuters. The pharma last month won the FDA’s approval for an oral version of Wegovy. The drug launched last week with a monthly out-of-pocket cost as low as $149 for the 1.5-mg and 4-mg doses. Higher doses cost as much as $299 per month.

All Eyes Still on Eylea as Regeneron Pushes on With Muscle Preservation

A high-dose version of Regeneron’s eye injection Eylea appears to finally be gaining steam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the high-dose formulation made $506 million, a 66% year-on-year increase, CEO Leonard Schleifer said during a company presentation at JPM.

More tellingly, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said in a Monday note that Eylea HD beat the analyst consensus by $60 million, indicating that “conversion to the high dose product may be accelerating.” A pre-filled syringe version of the injection is expected to undergo regulatory review this year, the group added, noting that it could lead to “more robust uptake” if approved.

Indeed, Schleifer at the conference revealed that “the mix of our franchise net sales has been steadily shifting towards Eylea HD since launch with Eylea HD now comprising nearly half of net sales.” All told, Regeneron’s Eylea franchise made $1.1 billion last year.

Regeneron at JPM also doubled down on its obesity plans. This year, the pharma expects to launch a late-stage monotherapy program for its GIP/GLP-1 therapy olatorepatide, as well as report additional muscle preservation data for the combination of semaglutide with trevogrumab and garetosmab, according to a company presentation.

BridgeBio Delivers ‘Surprise’ Q4 Beat With Attruby

Also presenting strong sales numbers at JPM was BridgeBio Pharma, which revealed that in the fourth quarter of 2024, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) drug Attruby hit net product revenues of $146 million. Analysts at Truist Securities called this sales figure a “surprise” beat for Attruby in a Monday note, representing a 35% quarter-on-quarter growth. The uptick, they added, was driven by “an acceleration in the momentum of new patient adds.”

There were 6,629 unique patient prescriptions as of Dec. 31, 2025, BridgeBio reported, which Truist said was up nearly a thousand from 5,259 from Oct. 25, 2025. “We are particularly encouraged in the 4Q growth relative to the competition,” the analysts noted, pointing to the approximately 20% quarter-on-quarter sales increase for Alnylam’s Amvuttra.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/57342ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1254x705+0+65/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Fe6%2F161bc323476ca3f9a6ea303db160%2Fistock-2232417355.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:00:56.093022

Morgan Healthcare Conference 2026, Boston Scientific described the significant growth and market success of its pulsed field ablation (PFA) offerings, including the FARAWAVE and FARAPULSE PFA catheters, on 13 January.

Boston Scientific indicated double-digit growth for its PFA portfolio, with 15% growth expected to continue for at least another three years. Currently, Boston Scientific is the US market leader for PFA devices.

The high growth of the PFA market has been driven by the high number of atrial fibrillation patients in the US and worldwide. During the conference, Boston Scientific indicated a population of over 10 million atrial fibrillation patients in the US alone, with over 60 million worldwide. Currently, penetration for PFA and related technologies to treat heart arrythmias is very low, representing a very large unaddressed market which Boston Scientific is confident it can lead in with its PFA portfolio.

Boston Scientific expects incredibly high growth for its PFA devices, driven by increased usage of its existing catheters to address the large unaddressed patient population, and approvals of new PFA catheters for expanded indications, including the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the FARAPOINT catheter to treat patients with atrial flutter. The company has also announced its intention to expand indications to other arrythmias, including ventricular tachycardia.

In addition to growing the PFA segment through new indications and further penetration of the atrial fibrillation patient population, Boston Scientific also announced its intention to expand into ambulatory surgical centers. As additional states approve their usage, Boston Scientific believes that this represents another unaddressed market where PFA can be used.

Entering 2026, Boston Scientific is poised to succeed within the PFA market.

BNY Mellon Delivers Record Earnings Amid Strategic Shift and Select Headwinds

The earnings call for Bank of New York Mellon Corporation struck a notably upbeat tone, underscored by record revenue, net income, and robust returns on capital. Management emphasized strong execution, widening margins, and clear commercial momentum in core franchises like Securities Services and Markets & Wealth Services. While they acknowledged pockets of weakness—particularly in Investment & Wealth Management flows, some fee pressures at Pershing, and deposit margin compression—the overall narrative was one of confidence, discipline, and rising ambitions, highlighted by higher medium‑term financial targets and visible progress on AI and platform initiatives.

Record Financial Results Underpin Confidence

BNY Mellon reported record full‑year 2025 net income of $5.3 billion on record revenue of $20.1 billion, up 8% year over year, showcasing the earnings power of its fee‑driven model leveraged by higher rates. Return on tangible common equity reached a standout 26% for the year, a level more associated with top‑tier capital‑light franchises than a traditional bank. Net interest income grew a robust 15% for the full year, while expenses rose only 3%, delivering positive operating leverage and margin expansion. This combination of revenue growth and disciplined cost control formed the backbone of management’s upbeat message.

Q4 Momentum: EPS Surges on Strong Top Line

Fourth‑quarter performance reinforced the full‑year story, with total revenue of $5.2 billion up 7% year over year and fee revenue rising 5%. Net interest income grew 13% in the quarter, indicating that rate benefits and balance sheet positioning still support earnings. Reported Q4 EPS jumped 31% to $2.02, while full‑year EPS climbed 28% to $7.40 ($7.50 excluding notable items, up 24%), showing that growth is translating effectively to the bottom line. Credit quality remained a support, with a $26 million benefit to the provision for credit losses in Q4, underscoring the low‑risk profile of BNY Mellon’s balance sheet.

Operating Leverage and Margins Move to New Highs

BNY Mellon delivered substantial operating leverage in 2025, generating 507 basis points of positive leverage on a reported basis (411 bps excluding notable items). Full‑year pretax margin improved to 35% (36% ex‑notables), while Q4 pretax margin was around 36% and quarterly ROTCE reached 27%. This margin profile reflects both revenue scale and efficiency gains, positioning the bank more like a high‑quality financial utility than a traditional spread‑dependent bank. Management framed these results as evidence that its business mix and operating model can consistently generate attractive, capital‑efficient returns even amid pockets of macro uncertainty.

Securities Services Posts Strong Growth and Beats Targets

The Securities Services franchise, a core pillar of BNY Mellon’s identity, showed clear momentum. Q4 revenue in the segment rose 7% year over year to $2.5 billion, with investment services fees up a strong 11%, reflecting deeper client penetration and higher activity. Assets under custody and/or administration for ETFs reached $3.8 trillion, up 34%, with more than 2,500 funds serviced, a 22% increase—highlighting BNY Mellon’s position at the center of ETF infrastructure. Segment pretax income surged 30% to $838 million, and pretax margin reached roughly 34%, surpassing the prior medium‑term target of at least 30% and giving management confidence to raise its ambitions.

Markets & Wealth Services Extends Its Lead

Markets & Wealth Services also delivered another strong quarter, with Q4 revenue of $1.8 billion, up 8% year over year. Clearance and Collateral Management investment services fees grew 15%, supported by average collateral balances of $7.5 trillion, also up 15%, underscoring BNY Mellon’s central role in global market plumbing. Pershing, the clearing and wealth platform, posted $51 billion of net new assets in Q4, reinforcing its competitive positioning even as fees face some pressure. Segment net interest income increased 20% year over year, and pretax margin of around 49% highlighted the capital‑light, high‑return nature of the franchise.

Capital Returns and Balance Sheet Remain a Key Shareholder Theme

BNY Mellon continued to return substantial capital to shareholders, with $5 billion distributed in 2025 through dividends and buybacks. In Q4 alone, capital returned totaled $1.4 billion, equating to a 100% payout ratio for the year, signaling management’s confidence in the sustainability of earnings and capital strength. The CET1 ratio ended Q4 at 11.9%, up 17 basis points sequentially, while liquidity remained robust with a liquidity coverage ratio of 112% and a net stable funding ratio of 130%. These metrics give the bank flexibility to maintain high capital returns while investing in growth, even under evolving regulatory and market conditions.

Platform Operating Model and AI Start to Scale

Management highlighted significant progress on its platform operating model and AI strategy, which are central to its long‑term efficiency and service ambitions. During 2025, roughly half of the workforce was transitioned into the platform operating model, bringing more than 70% of employees into the structure overall, aimed at standardizing processes and scaling capabilities across businesses. The bank deployed over 130 digital employees and scaled its enterprise AI platform “Eliza,” supported by collaborations with major technology partners. These efforts are designed to unlock capacity, reduce manual work, and improve client outcomes, providing a structural underpinning for improved margins over time.

Commercial Model Delivers Record Sales and Deeper Relationships

BNY Mellon’s refined commercial approach translated into record sales performance for the year, with a pronounced focus on cross‑selling and deepening client relationships. The number of clients purchasing three or more services increased by about 64% over two years, indicating success in bundling offerings across custody, collateral, treasury, and data solutions. Management called out notable wins in Q4, including a banking‑as‑a‑service mandate for digital assets with WisdomTree, a front‑to‑back win with an active asset manager, and a significant private markets data and analytics mandate with Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund. Approximately 10% of 2025 sales came from new logos, showing the franchise is still expanding its addressable client base.

Investment & Wealth Management Remains a Soft Spot

Despite strong group results, Investment & Wealth Management underperformed and remains an area of concern. Segment revenue declined 2% year over year to $854 million, while pretax income fell 14% to $148 million, leaving pretax margin at a modest 17%. Q4 saw net outflows of $3 billion, including a significant $23 billion of outflows from long‑term strategies, only partially offset by $20 billion into cash products. This mix suggests ongoing pressure on higher‑fee long‑term assets under management and highlights competitive and market challenges facing the active and traditional wealth businesses. Management will likely need to show tangible improvement here to sustain the group’s upward earnings trajectory.

Pershing Fee Mix and Revenue Composition Under Pressure

Within Markets & Wealth Services, Pershing’s fee performance showed some strain even as underlying activity remained healthy. Investment services fees at Pershing declined 2% year over year, in part due to prior‑year de‑conversion activity. Management indicated that looking ahead, fee growth at Pershing is likely to be more muted relative to net interest income in 2026 and may not fully offset other sources of revenue variability. For investors, this signals that while the platform remains a growth engine in terms of assets, the mix of revenue between fees and spread income is shifting, potentially increasing sensitivity to rate dynamics over time.

Deposit Margin Compression and NII Sustainability Risks

Although net interest income grew strongly in 2025—up 15% for the year and 13% in Q4—management acknowledged some pressure beneath the surface. Deposit margin compression weighed on results in the quarter, and the bank cautioned that December was an unusually strong month for NII that may not fully annualize into 2026. With average balances expected to be roughly flat in 2026, future NII growth will rely more heavily on reinvesting maturing securities into higher‑yielding assets rather than balance sheet expansion. This introduces some execution and market‑rate risk into what has been a key earnings tailwind.

Expense Growth and Reinvestment Could Cap Margin Upside

Cost control remains generally solid, but reinvestment is pushing expenses higher and could constrain incremental margin upside if revenue underperforms expectations. Full‑year expenses rose 3% on a reported basis, while Q4 expenses were flat year over year but up 4% excluding notable items, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. For 2026, management is guiding to expense growth of 3%–4% (ex‑notable items), aligning investment in technology, people, and platforms with its strategy. However, this sets a bar for revenue growth; should the environment soften, maintaining the desired level of positive operating leverage could become more challenging.

Market‑Sensitive Revenue Streams Highlight Volatility Risk

The call also highlighted that some parts of BNY Mellon’s revenue base remain sensitive to market conditions, especially volatility and foreign exchange. In Q4, foreign exchange revenue in Securities Services was down 3% year over year, driven by lower spreads amid reduced FX volatility. While this is not a major earnings swing factor in the context of the overall franchise, it serves as a reminder that certain fee lines are cyclical. For investors, this means that periods of subdued market activity can dampen growth in otherwise stable businesses.

Digital Asset and Tokenization Bets Still in Early Innings

BNY Mellon continued to expand its footprint in digital assets and tokenization, announcing initiatives such as tokenized deposits capabilities and a Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund. These efforts signal a strategic bet on the future of financial infrastructure, where tokenization and digital rails could reshape settlement, liquidity, and investment products. However, management was clear that these initiatives remain in early stages, with monetization and large‑scale adoption still uncertain. For now, they represent optionality and strategic positioning rather than a near‑term earnings driver.

Guidance and Elevated Medium-Term Ambitions

Looking ahead to 2026, BNY Mellon guided to about 5% year‑over‑year growth in total revenue (excluding notable items), acknowledging that performance will be partly market‑dependent. Expenses are expected to rise roughly 3%–4%, with a target of at least 100 basis points of positive operating leverage, implying continued efficiency gains. Management expects net interest income to grow slightly faster than 5%, supported by reinvesting maturing securities at an estimated 100–150 basis point yield pickup, while fee growth may come in a bit below 5%. Average balances are projected to be roughly flat, and the bank anticipates a quarterly tax rate near 23%, with some first‑quarter noise from vesting‑related benefits and higher staff expense. Over the medium term, BNY Mellon raised its pretax margin target by 500 basis points to 38% and its ROTCE target by 500 basis points to 28%, while maintaining a Tier 1 leverage target of 5.5%–6% and continuing robust capital returns supported by strong liquidity and capital metrics.

In summary, BNY Mellon’s latest earnings call painted a picture of a franchise firing on most cylinders, with record earnings, rising margins, and visible benefits from platform and AI investments. While weaknesses in Investment & Wealth Management, fee pressures at Pershing, NII composition risk, and market‑sensitive revenue lines present real challenges, management’s raised targets, disciplined capital returns, and strong core businesses offer a compelling story for investors. The key watchpoints over the next year will be execution on cost discipline and technology, stabilization of long‑term asset flows, and the bank’s ability to sustain profitable growth in a more normalized rate and volatility environment.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1929233657.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:13:28.809710

Pricing Date: January 9, 2026 Issue Date: January 14, 2026 Final Calculation Day2: January 9, 2029 Stated Maturity Date2: January 12, 2029 Principal Amount: $1,000 per security. References in this pricing supplement to a “security” are to a security with a principal amount of $1,000. Contingent Coupon Payment:

On each contingent coupon payment date, you will receive a contingent coupon payment at a per annum rate equal to the contingent coupon rate if the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the related calculation day is greater than or equal to its threshold price.

Each “contingent coupon payment,” if any, will be calculated per security as follows:

($1,000 × contingent coupon rate) / 12

Any contingent coupon payments will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded upward.

If the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on any calculation day is less than its threshold price, you will not receive any contingent coupon payment on the related contingent coupon payment date. If the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on each calculation day is less than its threshold price, you will not receive any contingent coupon payments over the term of the securities.

Any return on the securities will be limited to the sum of your contingent coupon payments, if any, even if the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on any calculation day significantly exceeds its starting price. You will not participate in any appreciation of any Underlying Stock.

Contingent Coupon Payment Dates2: Monthly, on the third business day following each calculation day, provided that the contingent coupon payment date with respect to the final calculation day will be the stated maturity date. If a calculation day is postponed with respect to one or more Underlying Stocks, the related contingent coupon payment date will be three business days after the latest calculation day as postponed. Contingent Coupon Rate: The “contingent coupon rate” is 18.40% per annum.

PS- 2

Automatic Call:

If the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on any of the calculation days scheduled to occur from July 2026 to December 2028, inclusive, is greater than or equal to its starting price, the securities will be automatically called, and on the related call settlement date you will be entitled to receive a cash payment per security in U.S. dollars equal to the principal amount plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due. The securities will not be subject to automatic call until the sixth calculation day, which is approximately six months after the issue date.

If the securities are automatically called, they will cease to be outstanding on the related call settlement date and you will have no further rights under the securities after that call settlement date. You will not receive any notice from us if the securities are automatically called.

Calculation Days2: Monthly, on the 9th day of each month, commencing February 2026 and ending January 2029, provided that the January 2029 calculation day will be the final calculation day Call Settlement Date: The contingent coupon payment date immediately following the applicable calculation day Maturity Payment Amount:

If the securities are not automatically called prior to the stated maturity date, you will be entitled to receive on the stated maturity date a cash payment per security in U.S. dollars equal to the maturity payment amount (in addition to any contingent coupon payment otherwise due). The “maturity payment amount” per security will equal:

· if the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than or equal to its threshold price: $1,000; or

· if the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price:

$1,000 × performance factor of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day

If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity and the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, you will lose more than 50%, and possibly all, of the principal amount of your securities at stated maturity.

Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the securities.

Lowest Performing Underlying Stock: For any calculation day, the “lowest performing Underlying Stock” will be the Underlying Stock with the lowest performance factor on that calculation day. Performance Factor: With respect to an Underlying Stock on any calculation day, its stock closing price on such calculation day divided by its starting price. Stock Closing Price1: With respect to each Underlying Stock, “stock closing price” has the meaning set forth under “General Terms of the Securities—Certain Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Stock—Certain Definitions” in the product supplement. The stock closing price of each Underlying Stock is subject to adjustment through the adjustment factor as described in the product supplement. Ending Price: The “ending price” of an Underlying Stock will be its stock closing price on the final calculation day. Additional Terms: Terms used in this pricing supplement, but not defined herein, will have the meanings ascribed to them in the product supplement, provided that terms used in this pricing supplement, but not defined herein or in the product supplement, will have the meanings ascribed to them in the prospectus supplement.

1 In the case of certain corporate events related to an Underlying Stock, the calculation agent may adjust the adjustment factor of that Underlying Stock if the calculation agent determines that the event has a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the shares of that Underlying Stock. Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events with respect to an Underlying Stock, the calculation agent will make adjustments to reflect the amount and type of property deliverable for one share of that Underlying Stock as a result of that reorganization event. An Underlying Stock may be replaced with another stock selected by the calculation agent upon the occurrence of certain replacement stock events. For more information, see “General Terms of the Securities—Certain Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Stock—Adjustment Events” in the accompanying product supplement.

2 If any calculation day is not a trading day with respect to any Underlying Stock, that calculation day for each Underlying Stock will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a trading day with respect to each Underlying Stock. A calculation day will also be postponed for any Underlying Stock if a market disruption event occurs with respect to that Underlying Stock on that calculation day as described under “General Terms of the Securities—Consequences of a Market Disruption Event; Postponement of a Calculation Day—Securities Linked to Multiple Market Measures” in the accompanying product supplement. In addition, the stated maturity date will be postponed if that day is not a business day or if the final calculation day is postponed as described under “General Terms of the Securities—Payment Dates” in the accompanying product supplement.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is less than the original offering price of the securities. The difference between the original offering price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Determining Payment on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date and at Maturity

On each contingent coupon payment date prior to the stated maturity date, whether you receive a contingent coupon payment and, if the contingent coupon payment date is also a potential call settlement date, whether the securities are automatically called will each be determined based on the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the related calculation day.

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day prior to the final calculation day. The lowest performing Underlying Stock on any calculation day is the Underlying Stock that has the lowest performance factor on that calculation day, calculated for each Underlying Stock as the stock closing price of that Underlying Stock on that calculation day divided by its starting price.

Step 2: Determine if the securities are automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment is paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date prior to the stated maturity date, based on the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day, as follows:

On the stated maturity date, if the securities have not been automatically called prior to the stated maturity date, you will receive a cash payment per security (the maturity payment amount) calculated as described below.

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day. The lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is the Underlying Stock that has the lowest performance factor on the final calculation day, calculated for each Underlying Stock as its ending price divided by its starting price.

Step 2: Calculate the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day, as follows:

PS- 10

Hypothetical Payout Profile

The following profile illustrates the potential maturity payment amount on the securities (excluding any contingent coupon payment otherwise due) for a range of hypothetical performances of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day from its starting price to its ending price, assuming the securities have not been automatically called prior to the stated maturity date. As this profile illustrates, in no event will you have a positive rate of return based solely on the maturity payment amount received at maturity; any positive return will be based solely on the contingent coupon payments, if any, received during the term of the securities. This graph has been prepared for purposes of illustration only. Your actual return will depend on the actual ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day and whether you hold your securities to stated maturity. The performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities.

PS- 11

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in any or all of the Underlying Stocks. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” sections of the product supplement and prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

·If The Securities Are Not Automatically Called Prior To Stated Maturity, You May Lose Some Or All Of The Principal Amount Of Your Securities At Stated Maturity — We will not repay you a fixed amount on your securities at stated maturity. If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity, you will receive a maturity payment amount that will be equal to or less than the principal amount, depending on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

If the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount will be less than the principal amount and you will have full downside exposure to the decrease in the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock from its starting price. The threshold price for each Underlying Stock is 50% of its starting price. For example, if the securities are not automatically called and the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day has declined by 50.1% from its starting price to its ending price, you will not receive any benefit of the contingent downside protection feature and you will lose 50.1% of the principal amount. As a result, you will not receive any protection if the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day declines significantly and you may lose some, and possibly all, of the principal amount of your securities at stated maturity, even if the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock is greater than or equal to its starting price or its threshold price at certain times during the term of the securities.

Even if the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount will not exceed the principal amount, and your yield on the securities, taking into account any contingent coupon payments you may have received during the term of the securities, may be less than the yield you would earn if you bought a traditional interest-bearing debt security of Barclays Bank PLC or another issuer with a similar credit rating.

·The Securities Do Not Provide For Fixed Payments Of Interest And You May Receive No Contingent Coupon Payments On One Or More Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, Or Even Throughout The Entire Term Of The Securities — On each contingent coupon payment date you will receive a contingent coupon payment if the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the related calculation day is greater than or equal to its threshold price. If the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on any calculation day is less than its threshold price, you will not receive any contingent coupon payment on the related contingent coupon payment date, and if the stock closing price of at least one Underlying Stock is less than its threshold price on each calculation day over the term of the securities, you will not receive any contingent coupon payments over the entire term of the securities.

·The Securities Are Subject To The Full Risks Of Each Underlying Stock And Will Be Negatively Affected If Any Underlying Stock Performs Poorly, Even If The Other Underlying Stocks Perform Favorably — You are subject to the full risks of each Underlying Stock. If any Underlying Stock performs poorly, you will be negatively affected, even if the other Underlying Stocks perform favorably. The securities are not linked to a basket composed of the Underlying Stocks, where the better performance of some Underlying Stocks could offset the poor performance of others. Instead, you are subject to the full risks of whichever Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on each calculation day. As a result, the securities are riskier than an alternative investment linked to only one of the Underlying Stocks or linked to a basket composed of each Underlying Stock. You should not invest in the securities unless you understand and are willing to accept the full downside risks of each Underlying Stock.

·You May Be Fully Exposed To The Decline In The Lowest Performing Underlying Stock On The Final Calculation Day From Its Starting Price, But Will Not Participate In Any Positive Performance Of Any Underlying Stock — Even though you will be fully exposed to a decline in the price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day if its ending price is below its threshold price, you will not participate in any increase in the price of any Underlying Stock over the term of the securities. Your maximum possible return on the securities will be limited to the sum of the contingent coupon payments you receive, if any. Consequently, your return on the securities may be significantly less than the return you could achieve on an alternative investment that provides for participation in an increase in the price of any or each Underlying Stock.

·Your Return On The Securities Will Depend Solely On The Performance Of The Underlying Stock That Is The Lowest Performing Underlying Stock On Each Calculation Day, And You Will Not Benefit In Any Way From The Performance Of The Better Performing Underlying Stocks — Your return on the securities will depend solely on the

PS- 12

performance of the Underlying Stock that is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on each calculation day. Although it is necessary for each Underlying Stock to close at or above its threshold price on the relevant calculation day in order for you to receive a contingent coupon payment and on the final calculation day for you to be repaid the principal amount of your securities at maturity, you will not benefit in any way from the performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks. The securities may underperform an alternative investment linked to a basket composed of the Underlying Stocks, since in such case the performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks would be blended with the performance of the lowest performing Underlying Stock, resulting in a better return than the return of the lowest performing Underlying Stock alone.

·Higher Contingent Coupon Rates Are Associated With Greater Risk — The securities offer contingent coupon payments at a higher rate, if paid, than the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities of the same maturity. These higher potential contingent coupon payments are associated with greater levels of expected risk as of the pricing date as compared to conventional debt securities, including the risk that you may not receive a contingent coupon payment on one or more, or any, contingent coupon payment dates and the risk that you may lose a substantial portion, and possibly all, of the principal amount at maturity. The volatility of the Underlying Stocks and the correlation among the Underlying Stocks are important factors affecting this risk. Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the prices of the Underlying Stocks over a period of time. Volatility can be measured in a variety of ways, including on a historical basis or on an expected basis as implied by option prices in the market. The correlation of a pair of Underlying Stocks represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlying Stocks are similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. Greater expected volatility of the Underlying Stocks or lower expected correlation among the Underlying Stocks as of the pricing date may result in a higher contingent coupon rate, but it also represents a greater expected likelihood as of the pricing date that the stock closing price of at least one Underlying Stock will be less than its threshold price on one or more calculation days, such that you will not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments during the term of the securities, and that the stock closing price of at least one Underlying Stock will be less than its threshold price on the final calculation day such that you will lose a substantial portion, and possibly all, of the principal amount at maturity. In general, the higher the contingent coupon rate is relative to the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities, the greater the expected risk that you will not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments during the term of the securities and that you will lose a substantial portion, and possibly all, of the principal amount at maturity.

·You Will Be Subject To Reinvestment Risk — If your securities are automatically called, the term of the securities may be reduced to as short as approximately six months. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the securities at a comparable return for a similar level of risk in the event the securities are automatically called prior to maturity.

·You Will Be Subject To Risks Resulting From The Relationship Between The Underlying Stocks — The correlation of a pair of Underlying Stocks represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlying Stocks are similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. By investing in the securities, you assume the risk that the returns of the Underlying Stocks will not be correlated. The less correlated the Underlying Stocks, the more likely it is that any one of the Underlying Stocks will be performing poorly at any time over the term of the securities. All that is necessary for the securities to perform poorly is for one of the Underlying Stocks to perform poorly; the performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities. It is impossible to predict what the relationship between the Underlying Stocks will be over the term of the securities. The Underlying Stocks may represent different equity markets, and those equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the securities.

·Any Payment On The Securities Will Be Determined Based On The Stock Closing Prices Of The Underlying Stocks On The Dates Specified — Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the stock closing prices of the Underlying Stocks on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underlying Stocks determined at any other time.

·Owning The Securities Is Not The Same As Owning Any Or All Of The Underlying Stocks — The return on your securities may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any or all of the Underlying Stocks. For instance, as a holder of the securities, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Underlying Stock would have.

·No Assurance That The Investment View Implicit In The Securities Will Be Successful — It is impossible to predict whether and the extent to which the price of any Underlying Stock will rise or fall. There can be no assurance that the price of any Underlying Stock will not close below its threshold price on any calculation day. The price of each Underlying Stock will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, financial and other factors that affect that Underlying Stock. You should be willing to accept the downside risks associated with equities in general and each Underlying Stock in particular, and the risk of losing a significant portion or all of the principal amount.

·Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

·The Securities Are Subject To The Credit Risk Of Barclays Bank PLC — The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

·You May Lose Some Or All Of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-In Power Is Exercised By The Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlying Stocks

·There Are Risks Associated With Single Equities — The price of each Underlying Stock can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to that Underlying Stock and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of each Underlying Stock.

·We Cannot Control Actions By An Underlying Stock Issuer — Actions by an Underlying Stock Issuer may have an adverse effect on the price of such Underlying Stock, the stock closing price of such Underlying Stock on any calculation day, the ending price of such Underlying Stock, and the value of the securities. We are not affiliated with any Underlying Stock Issuer. No Underlying Stock Issuer will be involved in the offering of the securities nor will any Underlying Stock Issuer have any obligations with respect to the securities, including any obligation to take our interests or your interests into consideration for any reason. No Underlying Stock Issuer will receive any of the proceeds of the offering of the securities nor will be responsible for, or will have participated in, the determination of the timing of, prices for, or quantities of, the securities to be issued. No Underlying Stock Issuer will be involved with the administration, marketing or trading of the securities nor will have any obligations with respect to any amounts payable on the securities.

·We And Our Affiliates Have No Affiliation With Any Underlying Stock Issuer And Have Not Independently Verified Their Public Disclosure Of Information — We, our affiliates and WFS and its affiliates are not affiliated in any way with any Underlying Stock Issuer. This pricing supplement relates only to the securities and does not relate to any Underlying Stock. The material provided in this pricing supplement concerning an Underlying Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available documents without independent verification. Neither we nor either agent has participated in the preparation of any of those documents or made any “due diligence” investigation or any inquiry of the Underlying Stock Issuers. Furthermore, neither we nor either agent knows whether any Underlying Stock Issuer has disclosed all events occurring before the date of this pricing supplement, including events that could affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents referred to above. Subsequent disclosure of any event of this kind or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning an Underlying Stock Issuer could affect

PS- 14

the value of the securities and any payments on the securities. You, as an investor in the securities, should make your own investigation into each Underlying Stock Issuer.

·You Have Limited Anti-dilution Protection — The calculation agent will, in its sole discretion, adjust the adjustment factor of an Underlying Stock for certain events affecting such Underlying Stock, such as stock splits and stock dividends, and certain other corporate actions involving the applicable Underlying Stock Issuer, such as mergers. However, the calculation agent is not required to make an adjustment for every corporate event that can affect an Underlying Stock. For example, the calculation agent is not required to make any adjustments to the adjustment factor of an Underlying Stock if the applicable Underlying Stock Issuer or anyone else makes a partial tender or partial exchange offer for such Underlying Stock. Consequently, this could affect the value of the securities and any payments on the securities. See “General Terms of the Securities—Certain Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Stock—Adjustment Events” in the accompanying product supplement for a description of the general circumstances in which the calculation agent will make adjustments to the adjustment factor of an Underlying Stock.

·The Securities May Become Linked To The Common Stock Of A Company Other Than An Original Underlying Stock Issuer — Following certain corporate events relating to an Underlying Stock, such as a stock-for-stock merger where the applicable Underlying Stock Issuer is not the surviving entity, the shares of a successor corporation to such Underlying Stock Issuer will be substituted for such Underlying Stock for all purposes of the securities. Following certain other corporate events relating to an Underlying Stock in which holders of such Underlying Stock would receive all of their consideration in cash and the surviving entity has no marketable securities outstanding or there is no surviving entity (including, but not limited to, a leveraged buyout or other going private transaction involving such Underlying Stock Issuer, or a liquidation of such Underlying Stock Issuer), the common stock of another company in the same industry group as such Underlying Stock Issuer will be substituted for such Underlying Stock for all purposes of the securities. In any such event, the equity-linked nature of the securities would be significantly altered. See “General Terms of the Securities—Certain Terms for Securities Linked to an Underlying Stock—Adjustment Events” in the accompanying product supplement for a description of the specific events that can lead to these adjustments and the procedures for selecting a replacement stock. The occurrence of such events and the consequent adjustments may materially and adversely affect the value of the securities and any payments on the securities.

·The Historical Performance Of The Underlying Stocks Is Not An Indication Of Their Future Performance — The historical performance of the Underlying Stocks should not be taken as an indication of the future performance of the Underlying Stocks. It is impossible to predict whether the closing prices of the Underlying Stocks will fall or rise during the term of the securities, in particular in the environment in the last several years, which has been characterized by volatility across a wide range of asset classes. Past fluctuations and trends in the prices of the Underlying Stocks are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations or trends that may occur in the future.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

·Potentially Inconsistent Research, Opinions Or Recommendations By Barclays Capital Inc., WFS Or Their Respective Affiliates — Barclays Capital Inc., WFS or their respective affiliates may publish research from time to time on financial markets and other matters that may influence the value of the securities or express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the securities. Any research, opinions or recommendations expressed by Barclays Capital Inc., WFA or their respective affiliates may not be consistent with each other and may be modified from time to time without notice. You should make your own independent investigation of each Underlying Stock and the merits of investing in the securities.

·We, Our Affiliates And Any Other Agent And/Or Participating Dealer May Engage In Various Activities Or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Securities In Various Ways And Create Conflicts Of Interest — We, our affiliates, WFS and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities (a “participating dealer”) may play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our economic interests and the economic interests of our affiliates, WFS and any participating dealer are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underlying Stocks. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities. Participating dealers may also engage in such activities that may negatively impact the value of the securities.

PS- 15

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the securities, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession and/or any fee that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, Barclays Bank PLC will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any prices of the Underlying Stocks and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying product supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlying Stocks” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities. Absent manifest error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be final and binding, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent. You will not be entitled to any compensation from Barclays Bank PLC for any loss suffered as a result of any determinations made by the calculation agent with respect to the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

·The Securities Will Not Be Listed On Any Securities Exchange And We Do Not Expect A Trading Market For The Securities To Develop — The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the securities but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

·The Value Of The Securities Prior To Maturity Will Be Affected By Numerous Factors, Some Of Which Are Related In Complex Ways — Structured notes, including the securities, can be thought of as securities that combine a debt instrument with one or more options or other derivative instruments. As a result, the factors that influence the values of debt instruments and options or other derivative instruments will also influence the terms and features of the securities at issuance and their value in the secondary market. Accordingly, in addition to the prices of the Underlying Stocks on any day, the value of the securities will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

·the expected volatility of the Underlying Stocks;

·correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Underlying Stocks;

·the time to maturity of the securities;

·the market prices of, and dividend rates on, the Underlying Stocks;

·interest and yield rates in the market generally;

·supply and demand for the securities;

·a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events; and

·our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

·The Estimated Value Of Your Securities Is Lower Than The Original Offering Price Of Your Securities — The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is lower than the original offering price of your securities. The difference between the original offering price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions, selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to Barclays Capital Inc., another affiliate

PS- 16

of ours, WFS or its affiliates or other non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities.

·The Estimated Value Of Your Securities Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based On The Levels At Which Our Debt Securities Trade In The Secondary Market — The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

·The Estimated Value Of The Securities Is Based On Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove To Be Inaccurate And May Be Different From The Pricing Models Of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

·The Estimated Value Of Your Securities Is Not A Prediction Of The Prices At Which You May Sell Your Securities In The Secondary Market, If Any, And Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than The Original Offering Price Of Your Securities And May Be Lower Than The Estimated Value Of Your Securities — The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the original offering price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the stated maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

·The Temporary Price At Which We May Initially Buy The Securities In The Secondary Market And The Value We May Initially Use For Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative Of Future Prices Of Your Securities — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Hypothetical Returns

If the securities are automatically called:

If the securities are automatically called prior to stated maturity, you will receive the principal amount of your securities plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due on the applicable call settlement date. In the event the securities are automatically called, your total return on the securities will equal any contingent coupon payments received prior to the call settlement date and the contingent coupon payment received on the call settlement date.

If the securities are not automatically called:

If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity, the following table illustrates, for a range of hypothetical performance factors of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day, the hypothetical maturity payment amount payable at stated maturity per security (excluding any contingent coupon payment otherwise due). The performance factor of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is calculated as its ending price divided by its starting price.

Hypothetical performance factor of

The above figures do not take into account contingent coupon payments, if any, received during the term of the securities. As evidenced above, in no event will you have a positive rate of return based solely on the maturity payment amount received at maturity (excluding any contingent coupon payment otherwise due); any positive return will be based solely on the contingent coupon payments, if any, received during the term of the securities.

The above figures are for purposes of illustration only and may have been rounded for ease of analysis. If the securities are not automatically called prior to stated maturity, the actual amount you will receive at stated maturity will depend on the actual ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day. The performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities.

PS- 18

Hypothetical Automatic Calls and Contingent Coupon Payments

Set forth below are examples that illustrate how to determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on a contingent coupon payment date prior to the stated maturity date. The examples do not reflect any specific contingent coupon payment date but assume that the securities are subject to automatic call on the applicable calculation day. The securities will not be subject to automatic call until the sixth calculation day, which is approximately six months after the issue date. The following examples assume the hypothetical starting price, threshold price and stock closing prices for each Underlying Stock indicated in the examples. The terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent any actual starting price or threshold price. The hypothetical starting price of $100.00 for each Underlying Stock has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual starting price for any Underlying Stock. The actual starting price and threshold price for each Underlying Stock are set forth under “Terms of the Securities” above. For historical closing prices of the Underlying Stocks, see the historical information set forth under the sections titled “The Common Stock of The Boeing Company,” “The Common Stock of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.,” “The Common Stock of Lockheed Martin Corporation” and “The Common Stock of Northrop Grumman Corporation” below. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and the values used in the examples may have been rounded for ease of analysis.

Example 1. The stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its threshold price and less than its starting price. As a result, the securities are not automatically called and investors receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical stock closing price on relevant calculation day: $95.00 $115.00 $105.00 $90.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (stock closing price on calculation day divided by starting price): 95.00% 115.00% 105.00% 90.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

In this example, the NOC Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

Step 2: Determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

Since the hypothetical stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its hypothetical threshold price, but less than its hypothetical starting price, the securities would not be automatically called and you would receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date. The contingent coupon payment would be equal to $15.33 per security, determined as follows: (i) $1,000 multiplied by 18.40% per annum divided by (ii) 12, rounded to the nearest cent.

Example 2. The stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is less than its threshold price. As a result, the securities are not automatically called and investors do not receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical stock closing price on relevant calculation day: $125.00 $45.00 $80.00 $105.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (stock closing price on calculation day divided by starting price): 125.00% 45.00% 80.00% 105.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

In this example, the KTOS Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

PS- 19

Step 2: Determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

The securities would not be automatically called, even though the stock closing prices of the better performing Underlying Stocks on the relevant calculation day are greater than their hypothetical starting prices. In addition, since the hypothetical stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is less than its hypothetical threshold price, you would not receive a contingent coupon payment on the applicable contingent coupon payment date. As this example illustrates, whether the securities are automatically called and whether you receive a contingent coupon payment on a contingent coupon payment date will depend solely on the stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day. This will be the case even if the better performing Underlying Stocks perform favorably. The performance of the better performing Underlying Stocks is not relevant to your return on the securities.

Example 3. The stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its starting price. As a result, the securities are automatically called on the applicable contingent coupon payment date for the principal amount plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical stock closing price on relevant calculation day: $105.00 $115.00 $110.00 $130.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (stock closing price on calculation day divided by starting price): 105.00% 115.00% 110.00% 130.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

In this example, the BA Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day.

Step 2: Determine whether the securities will be automatically called and whether a contingent coupon payment will be paid on the applicable contingent coupon payment date.

Since the hypothetical stock closing price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the relevant calculation day is greater than or equal to its hypothetical starting price, the securities would be automatically called and you would receive the principal amount plus the contingent coupon payment otherwise due on the call settlement date. On the call settlement date, you would receive $1,015.33 per security.

If the securities are automatically called prior to maturity, you will not receive any further payments after the call settlement date.

Hypothetical Maturity Payment Amount

Set forth below are examples of calculations of the maturity payment amount payable at stated maturity, assuming that the securities have not been automatically called prior to stated maturity and assuming the hypothetical starting price, threshold price and ending prices for each Underlying Stock indicated in the examples. The terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent any actual starting price or threshold price. The hypothetical starting price of $100.00 for each Underlying Stock has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual starting price for any Underlying Stock. The actual starting price and threshold price for each Underlying Stock are set forth under “Terms of the Securities” above. For historical closing prices of the Underlying Stocks, see the historical information set forth under the sections titled “The Common Stock of The Boeing Company,” “The Common Stock of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.,” “The Common Stock of Lockheed Martin Corporation” and “The Common Stock of Northrop Grumman Corporation” below. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and the values used in the examples may have been rounded for ease of analysis.

Example 1. The ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than its starting price, the maturity payment amount is equal to the principal amount of your securities at maturity and you receive the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical ending price: $135.00 $145.00 $130.00 $125.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (ending price divided by starting price): 135.00% 145.00% 130.00% 125.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

In this example, the NOC Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Step 2: Determine the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Since the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is greater than its hypothetical threshold price, the maturity payment amount would equal the principal amount. Although the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is significantly greater than its hypothetical starting price in this scenario, the maturity payment amount will not exceed the principal amount.

In addition to any contingent coupon payments received prior to the stated maturity date, on the stated maturity date you would receive $1,000.00 per security as well as the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

Example 2. The ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its starting price but greater than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount is equal to the principal amount of your securities at maturity and you receive the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical ending price: $115.00 $90.00 $95.00 $110.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (ending price divided by starting price): 115.00% 90.00% 95.00% 110.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

In this example, the KTOS Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Step 2: Determine the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Since the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is not less than its hypothetical threshold price, you would be repaid the principal amount of your securities at maturity.

PS- 21

In addition to any contingent coupon payments received prior to the stated maturity date, on the stated maturity date you would receive $1,000.00 per security as well as the contingent coupon payment otherwise due.

Example 3. The ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, the maturity payment amount is less than the principal amount of your securities at maturity and you do not receive a contingent coupon payment at maturity.

BA Stock KTOS Stock LMT Stock NOC Stock Hypothetical starting price: $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 $100.00 Hypothetical ending price: $45.00 $120.00 $135.00 $90.00 Hypothetical threshold price: $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 $50.00 Performance factor (ending price divided by starting price): 45.00% 120.00% 135.00% 90.00%

Step 1: Determine which Underlying Stock is the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

In this example, the BA Stock has the lowest performance factor and is, therefore, the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Step 2: Determine the maturity payment amount based on the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day.

Since the hypothetical ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its hypothetical threshold price, you would lose a portion of the principal amount of your securities and receive the maturity payment amount equal to $450.00 per security, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × performance factor of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day

= $1,000 × 45.00%

= $450.00

In addition to any contingent coupon payments received prior to the stated maturity date, on the stated maturity date you would receive $450.00 per security, but no contingent coupon payment.

These examples illustrate that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Underlying Stock, but will be fully exposed to a decrease in the lowest performing Underlying Stock if the ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day is less than its threshold price, even if the ending prices of the other Underlying Stocks have appreciated or have not declined below their respective threshold prices.

To the extent that the starting price, threshold price and ending price of the lowest performing Underlying Stock on the final calculation day differ from the values assumed above, the results indicated above would be different.

Tax Considerations

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any contingent coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a security. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, if you are a U.S. holder, upon a sale or exchange of the securities (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the securities, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the securities (assuming contingent coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the securities for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the securities at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your securities between the time your right to a contingent coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the contingent coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your securities prior to a calculation day but that can be attributed to an expected contingent coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the securities could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat contingent coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our representation that the securities do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel believes that these regulations should not apply to the securities with regard to non-U.S. holders, and we have determined to treat the securities as not being subject to Section 871(m). Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.

Non-U.S. holders should also discuss with their tax advisors the estate tax consequences of investing in the securities.

But over five years later, the initiative is still stalled on Capitol Hill, frustrating and confusing supporters in both parties while sparking a blame game inside the GOP.

The Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum Act, which was introduced last February, would secure a site for the museum by authorizing a plot of land on the National Mall to be transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. This is seen as the final legislative step in a decadelong process to create a national Smithsonian museum dedicated to women’s history.

The land transfer bill itself would not cost any money, and the project has raised $70 million in private donations to help with construction, which would be eligible for matching federal funds, according to the bill’s chief sponsor in the House, GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York.

There’s widespread support in Congress for the initiative: 123 Democrats and 99 Republicans are backing the bill in the House, along with President Donald Trump, who praised the measure during a women’s history month event at the White House in March.

“We have a great site. … It’s gonna be a big, beautiful museum,” Trump said. “We’re working on that, and we’re gonna back it 100%.”

Speaking to NBC News late last month, Malliotakis blamed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for the holdup, in just the latest example of Republican women openly expressing frustration with the speaker.

In a brief interview Tuesday, Malliotakis offered an update: “This is a history that needs to be told, and no one in Republican leadership should be standing in the way of this getting done. I’m frustrated, because I’m told one thing, and it doesn’t come to fruition.”

Malliotakis told NBC News she and other stakeholders had a meeting with Johnson at the beginning of last year, where she says they were given private assurances that the speaker would help move the bill along. Malliotakis left that meeting under the impression the legislation would advance in a timely manner.

But one year later, the legislation has gone nowhere. Not only has it not received a floor vote, but it hasn’t gone through committee or received a hearing. Some Republicans have fretted about the price tag for operating and maintaining another Smithsonian museum, which would be addressed in the annual appropriations process, and have questioned the necessity of a separate museum just for women.

Last week, after the House returned from its recess, Malliotakis said she did have some positive conversations with key committee leaders, as well as Johnson himself, that left her more encouraged about the prospects for the bill. She also noted the bill had recently gained 223 co-sponsors — a key metric, given that’s more than the necessary number to trigger a discharge petition in the House, which would force a vote on the matter.

But there are still no concrete plans to schedule a committee markup or floor vote anytime soon, according to two GOP sources familiar with the matter.

Malliotakis says she’s now giving leadership the benefit of the doubt that they’ll work with her on the bill.

“I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to do it through regular order in time for this Women’s History Month,” Malliotakis said. “That is my goal.”

Johnson’s office declined to comment on private conversations among members. But a senior GOP leadership aide said they have not been made aware of any major issues with the bill; it just hasn’t been made a priority yet. In addition, the House Administration Committee — which has jurisdiction over the legislation — has been busy with a congressional stock trading ban.

Malliotakis said she has raised her concerns about the museum delay not only with White House staff members, but also directly with Trump, whom she met with around Labor Day.

At one point, the White House discussed whether it could just transfer the land via executive action, according to Malliotakis. But that does not appear to be a viable course of action.

The White House also declined to comment.

Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, the lead Democratic co-sponsor, told NBC News all options are on the table — including a potential discharge petition to go around leadership’s head and force floor action.

“It’s time we recognize the role of women. And I’m working closely with her to get this done,” Dingell said, referring to Malliotakis.

A women’s history museum has long been in the works. In 2014, Congress established a bipartisan congressional commission to study the feasibility of building an American museum of women’s history.

The commission unanimously determined that the United States ought to have a physical national museum dedicated to celebrating the history and impact of women, given that the country has greatly benefited from their contributions.

The commission also concluded that women’s achievements are often underrepresented in historical accounts, monuments, memorials and museums.

But the effort has faced hurdles and resistance, particularly from Republicans. Some GOP lawmakers have expressed concern that the federal government will be on the hook for keeping the museum afloat and argue women’s history should just be incorporated into the existing national museums instead of establishing a separate one.

While Trump supports the women’s museum, he also signed an executive order last March targeting Smithsonian museums over “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology.” The executive order mentions that “the forthcoming Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women’s sports,” as just one of several examples.

The Smithsonian Institute, which consists of 21 museums, includes the National Museum of the American Indian, opened in 2004, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, opened in 2016. There are also efforts to open a National Museum of the American Latino and a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture.

In December 2020, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah blocked an effort to pass stand-alone legislation to establish museums for both women and Latinos.

“The last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation with an array of segregated, separate-but-equal museums for hyphenated identity groups,” Lee said at the time.

Weeks later, Congress authorized the creation of the women’s history museum as part of a massive year-end spending package, which was signed into law by Trump.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260105-Nicole-Malliotakis-gk-8d045d.jpg",N,,2026-01-13 23:59:10.122479

If you are serious about putting fresh capital to work, do not stop at Bank of New York Mellon Corporation when you can scan targeted ideas built from real numbers.","BNY (BK) recently reported fourth quarter 2025 results that came in ahead of consensus on both revenue and profit, paired with new medium term targets and a fresh dividend declaration that supported a modest share price reaction.

BNY’s latest quarterly beat, dividend declaration and push into tokenized deposits have come against a strong backdrop, with a 90 day share price return of 12.85% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 65.46%. This suggests momentum has been building rather than fading.

If BNY’s recent move has you thinking about where capital could work next, it might be worth scanning for other stocks building traction with both fundamentals and insiders.

With a strong recent run, a quarterly dividend of $0.53 a share and earnings coming in ahead of expectations, has Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s valuation run ahead of itself, or is the market still underestimating its prospects?

Most Popular Narrative: 3.7% Undervalued

With BNY last closing at $122.93 against a narrative fair value of $127.67, the implied upside is modest but clearly defined by specific assumptions.

Analysts have lifted their implied fair value for Bank of New York Mellon Corporation to $127.67 from $119.03, reflecting updated assumptions on revenue growth, profitability, and a slightly lower discount rate that together support a modestly higher forward P/E outlook for BNY.

Curious what kind of revenue path, margin profile and future earnings multiple are baked into that price? The full narrative lays out a precise playbook, step by step.

Result: Fair Value of $127.67 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this narrative still leans on healthy markets and fee trends, and any stumble in executing planned efficiency gains could quickly challenge those fair value assumptions.

Another View: Our DCF Signals Less Upside

While the narrative fair value sits at US$127.67, our DCF model points to a fair value of about US$100.10. With BNY at US$122.93, that implies it is trading above this DCF estimate. The question is which set of assumptions you find more realistic.

For the most recent quarter, Parker-Hannifin was expected to post earnings of $6.67 per share, but it reported $7.22 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $7.08 per share, while it actually produced $7.69 per share, a surprise of 8.62%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Parker-Hannifin, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Parker-Hannifin has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.

Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Ubrani said that if 2026 shipments fall by 9 percent, total PC shipments would drop to about 260 million, slightly below 2024's roughly 263.3 million units and close to 2023, ""one of the worst years in PC history.""
Now, using cloud plus on-device memory, a computer labeled as an ""AI PC"" could come with less than that.
Clarke said higher device costs are on the way, as well as bleaker configurations.
PC shipments set to hit the buffers as AI guzzles memory Memory is running out, and so are excuses for software bloat Tired of sky-high memory prices?","The rising cost of memory due to shortages is likely to persist into late 2027, driving higher device prices and lackluster configurations for PCs, tablets, and phones, IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani told The Register.

“We had assumed this would be primarily a 2026 story. More and more, particularly at CES, we had conversations with folks and they’re saying ‘You won’t find price stability in memory up until maybe late 2027.’ It means that prices will stop rising. Not that they’re going to drop. That’s what we’re hearing,” he told us on Tuesday. “This could be much longer than we had previously anticipated. Not just we at IDC, but we as a collective market.”

The PC market had a strong rebound in 2025, with device shipments totaling 284.7 million, driven by product refreshes and the end of support for Windows 10. The fourth quarter was particularly strong with 76.4 million devices shipped, up 9.6 percent year over year. For the full year, 2025 saw an 8.1 percent rise in PC shipments worldwide.

But part of that success comes from suppliers stockpiling inventory ahead of a looming memory shortage, Ubrani told The Register.

“Ultimately, it ended up far ahead of what anyone had hoped for. And given where things are today, it might be like the last good year we have for the next two years, or maybe even three years,” he said. “Things are kind of getting worse day by day from here on out.”

In November, IDC had already predicted the 2026 PC market could see a year-on-year decline of 2.4 percent, with a more moderate downside scenario putting the drop at 4.9 percent due to tough comparables against the PC surge last year. But a persistent memory supply crunch could push that to the most pessimistic prediction, roughly a 9 percent slide. Other analysts seem to agree it'll be a tough year.

Ubrani said that if 2026 shipments fall by 9 percent, total PC shipments would drop to about 260 million, slightly below 2024's roughly 263.3 million units and close to 2023, ""one of the worst years in PC history.""

He added 2023 and 2016 had the same volume of shipments with about 260 million.

“2023 was one of the worst because it was after the boom brought about by the pandemic and it was a year where everyone had excess inventory,” he explained. “Now we're potentially getting back to pre-pandemic levels.”

The PCs that do arrive in 2026 are likely to be more expensive with fewer features.

Ubrani said prior to the memory crunch, many vendors considered 16 GB of RAM as the starting point of what would be considered an AI PC. Now, using cloud plus on-device memory, a computer labeled as an ""AI PC"" could come with less than that.

“You might see instances where a system doesn’t have 16 gigs and they’re still promoted as an AI PC, but it would use this hybrid AI approach, where you can do some on device, but most of it in cloud,” Ubrani said. “The marketing to end users may not say that, and consumers again, can’t really tell the difference, or won't know the difference, but on the enterprise side, you will see the messaging change away from ‘on device AI.’ ”

During their most recent earnings calls, Lenovo, HP, and Dell all reassured investors they were capable of maneuvering through the looming memory shortages, but both Dell and HP said it would mean higher prices.

Dell’s COO Jeff Clarke, who took over leadership of that company’s PC division in 2025, said on the November call that this is the seventh DRAM supply shortage in the last 40 years that he has seen. The last one “of this magnitude” he said was between 2016 and 2017.

“It’s unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen. And by the way, it’s not unique to DRAM. It’s NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network,” he told analysts.

Clarke said higher device costs are on the way, as well as bleaker configurations.

Memory is running out, and so are excuses for software bloat

HP CEO Enrique Lores echoed that sentiment during that company’s November earnings call, saying that if the memory market doesn’t improve, expect higher PC costs in the second half of 2026.

Ubrani said Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Apple will face challenges, but their scale and relationship with chipmakers will insulate them. The vendors facing the most peril are smaller players such as Acer, Asus, and MSI.

“Even if they do get the memory, their prices are going to be so high that their finished PCs are going to be so expensive that their customers won’t buy it. So these are real challenges to be had, kind of across the board,” he said. “That’s why, again, a Lenovo, an Apple, they’re in a very good position, but even they’ve mentioned price hikes. So it's going to be a challenging environment going forward.” ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/08/22/shutterstock_187711835.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:01:56.534649

Proton’s Lumo AI chatbot has introduced a new feature called Projects, which provides users with an encrypted space to organize files, notes, and tasks related to specific workstreams. Lumo itself is a privacy-focused AI assistant developed by Proton AG that uses zero-access encryption and a no-logs approach to keep conversations confidential, meaning chats are encrypted and not stored in plain text on servers.

Proton positions the assistant as a tool for handling sensitive content such as documents and summaries without using that data to train models or expose it to third parties. With Projects, users can designate folders or collections of materials that Lumo can access to assist with task automation, document review, and content generation within that secure container. Files uploaded or linked through Proton Drive integration are protected under the same encryption protocols that secure chat history, ensuring that only the user can decrypt and view project contents.

Boston Scientific is eyeing land across the street from its current Arbor Lakes facility to house a four-story, 300,000-square-foot lab and office property, according to planning documents.

The new property is dubbed the Minnesota Science and Technology Center by planning documents. The land for the new facility is near Revere Lane and 73rd Place in Maple Grove.

A certificate of real estate value published last week shows that Boston Scientific recently sold the land the new facility would be built on, to an entity related to C.S. McCrossan. According to the CRV, the property was sold for $7.3 million, cash. Finance & Commerce reached out to C.S. McCrossan for this story.

Ryan Cos. submitted the preliminary and final plat approval to Maple Grove. Ryan also built the first Boston Scientific Arbor Lakes building, which the med-tech giant bought for $188 million, one of the most expensive real estate transactions of the last few years. Ryan declined to comment for this story.

Per planning documents, the 300,000 square feet will be split among four uses: Office space will take up 253,000 square feet, lab space will take up 11,000 square feet, another 9,000 square feet will be “Future Lab” space, while the remaining 26,700 will be for building-wide support. The first two floors of the building will serve as an amenities and training area, as well as a cafeteria and fitness center. The top floors will be office and laboratory space.

A spokesperson for Boston Scientific said the planning of the site was a part of the “ongoing process” to align the company’s real estate to support its growth.

The market’s failure to understand the nuance of the professional creative workflow has created a valuation anomaly.","The prevailing narrative surrounding Adobe Inc. in the mid-2020s has been characterized by a profound sense of technological anxiety. Market participants, driven by the rapid proliferation of standalone generative artificial intelligence platforms, have largely adopted a reductionist view of the creative software industry. This consensus suggests that as the cost of generating high-fidelity assets approaches zero, the economic moat surrounding Adobe’s professional suite must inevitably erode. However, a second-level analysis, mirroring the contrarian philosophy popularized by Howard Marks, suggests that this negative sentiment is not only overcooked but fundamentally detached from the operational realities of the professional creative workflow.

The current valuation of Adobe reflects a market that is pricing in a structural obsolescence that is not supported by the company’s underlying financial performance or its aggressive technological pivots. To understand the future trajectory of Adobe, one must distinguish between the ""casual generation"" of digital content and the ""professional production"" of brand-compliant assets. While the former is indeed being commoditized, the latter is becoming increasingly complex, requiring the exact vertically integrated framework that Adobe is currently perfecting.

The Psychology of Market Sentiment and the Pessimism Overcorrection

The investment landscape often oscillates between irrational exuberance and excessive pessimism. In the case of Adobe, the stock has experienced significant multiple compression, with its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio dropping from a peak of 56.6x in 2021 to a recent low of approximately 19.8x to 20.7x as of early 2026. This represents a decadal low, reaching levels last seen during the initial uncertainty of the company’s transition to the Creative Cloud subscription model in 2011-2013.

This compression is a direct result of the ""AI fear"" narrative. Investors have observed the ""sloppy"" but impressive outputs of tools like Midjourney, Runway, and Sora, and concluded that the professional will no longer need Photoshop or Premiere Pro. However, this perspective ignores the historical precedent of Adobe’s resilience through multiple technological shifts, including the transitions from desktop publishing to web design, and from perpetual licensing to SaaS. The current market sentiment appears to be at a ""trough of disillusionment,"" failing to recognize that Adobe is not a legacy bystander but the primary orchestrator of the AI transition for the enterprise.

.

The data indicates that Adobe is operationally stronger than ever, with record-high gross margins and net margins hovering around 30%. The disconnect between these fundamentals and the compressed valuation multiple suggests a significant margin of safety for the patient investor, provided the company can prove its AI monetization strategy.

The Vertical Integration Moat: Beyond Standalone Tools

The fundamental misunderstanding of the creative industry involves the ""iteration problem."" Standalone AI tools are excellent for ideation—creating a single, striking image from a prompt. However, professional work is rarely the result of a single prompt. It is a collaborative, iterative process involving dozens of adjustments to lighting, composition, layer structure, and brand alignment.

The Friction of Fragmented Workflows

Standalone AI generators exist as ""isolated islands"" in the creative process. A designer might generate a background in a browser-based tool, then export it, import it into Photoshop for retouching, then move to After Effects for animation. Each step in this fragmented workflow introduces friction, loss of fidelity, and complex asset management challenges. Adobe’s competitive edge lies in its ability to vertically integrate these AI tools into a unified framework where the image generation, editing, and final output occur in a ""perfect editing sync"".

Adobe Firefly is not merely a generator; it is a feature set embedded within the existing tools that professionals already use. When a user utilizes ""Generative Fill"" in Photoshop, the AI-generated pixels are not a static image but a layer that respects the lighting, perspective, and resolution of the surrounding project. This integration solves the ""trial and error"" fatigue associated with standalone tools, where users often exhaust their credit limits before achieving a professional-grade result.

Generative Credits and the Logic of Monetization

Adobe has introduced a ""Generative Credit"" system that serves as the economic backbone of its AI strategy. Unlike competitors whose pricing models can be opaque or prohibitively expensive for high-volume users, Adobe has tied AI consumption to its existing subscription tiers while offering ""Firefly Credit Add-ons"" for heavy users.

This system creates a ""consumption-to-conversion flywheel."" As professionals integrate AI into their daily workflows, their credit usage increases. When they hit the limits of their current plan, the path of least resistance is to upgrade to a higher Creative Cloud tier or purchase a credit pack, thereby driving Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) expansion. In Q4 FY2025, Adobe reported that generative credit consumption increased 3x quarter-over-quarter, a metric that serves as a powerful leading indicator of future subscription upgrades.

Technical Superiority and the ""Commercially Safe"" Moat

A significant portion of the bear case rests on the idea that open-source or third-party models will eventually outperform Adobe’s proprietary models. However, this ignores the ""Commercial Safety"" requirement of the Fortune 500. Large enterprises cannot risk utilizing AI models trained on copyrighted data without proper licensing, as it exposes them to massive legal liabilities.

The Firefly Foundation

Adobe Firefly sucks. Let's get that out the way. But it was trained specifically on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content where the copyright has expired. This allows Adobe to provide its enterprise customers with legal indemnification - a promise that the content generated by their employees will not lead to a copyright lawsuit. For a Fortune 500 company, this protection is not a ""nice-to-have""; it is a prerequisite for the adoption of generative AI at scale.

As of late 2025, 75% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Adobe Firefly, and 90% of Adobe’s top 50 enterprise clients are utilizing these AI tools. This high level of penetration among the world’s largest spenders suggests that the ""sloppy"" competition is not effectively challenging Adobe where the money is most concentrated.

Breakthroughs in 3D and Video Manipulation

Adobe has been quietly working on features that extend far beyond simple image generation. ""Project Neo,"" for example, allows designers to work with 3D sketches and reference shapes, which the AI then renders into production-ready 2D assets. This enables 3D light manipulation, allowing a designer to change the angle and perspective of an object’s lighting after it has been generated.

Furthermore, the integration of the Firefly Video Model into Premiere Pro via ""Generative Extend"" is a technical marvel that addresses the ""professional"" need for precision. While a tool like Sora might generate a whole new video, Adobe’s tool allows an editor to add two seconds to the end of an existing clip, perfectly matching the original lighting, motion, and grain. This is the difference between ""AI slop"" and a ""streamlined professional outcome"".

The Competitive Landscape: Canva and the ""Professional"" Delusion

The rise of Canva is often cited as a direct threat to Adobe’s dominance. However, an analyst looking at the KPIs and market segmentation would conclude that the two companies are operating in largely different categories. Canva is an accessibility tool for non-designers - small business owners, social media managers, and educators who need ""good enough"" content quickly.

Segmentation of the Creative Market

While Canva has a massive user base (over 220 million MAU), its revenue is a fraction of Adobe’s, totaling approximately $2.7 billion in 2024. In contrast, Adobe’s Digital Media segment alone exited FY2025 with $19.2 billion in ARR.

Casual User / Small SMB > Canva (Speed, Templates, Ease of Use)

Prosumer / Freelance > Adobe / Canva Hybrid (Flexibility, Price, Basic Pro Tools)

Enterprise / Creative Agency > Adobe Creative Cloud (Precision, Compliance, Full Ecosystem)

Fortune 500 Branding > Adobe Suite (Quality Control, Licensing, Scale)

Canva’s 2024 acquisition of Affinity was a clear signal of its intent to move upmarket, but Adobe’s dominance in the ""Creative and Marketing Professionals"" group remains robust, with subscription revenue growing at 11% YoY. The competitive landscape is not a zero-sum game; the total addressable market for digital content is expanding so rapidly that both companies can grow, but Adobe remains the gatekeeper for high-end production.

The Figma Post-Mortem and the Pivot to Social Content

The failure to acquire Figma was a tactical blow to Adobe’s dominance in the UI/UX design market. Figma has effectively won that segment, with Adobe XD being relegated to maintenance mode. However, a broader strategic view suggests that the importance of traditional web design is being eclipsed by the explosive growth of the creator economy and social-first content.

The Decline of Web Design Agency Budgets

Ten to fifteen years ago, the primary creative spend for a corporation was a high-end, experimental website designed by a boutique agency. Today, those budgets have shifted toward social media programs, influencer partnerships, and in-house content creation for platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

.

In this new reality, the tools that matter are not necessarily UI/UX prototyping tools, but high-performance video editing (Premiere/After Effects) and rapid social content tools (Adobe Express/Firefly). Adobe is significantly better positioned to capture the ""social content"" budget than it was to recapture the ""web design"" budget through Figma. The $20 billion intended for Figma has been redirected toward AI R&D and aggressive share repurchases, which may ultimately prove to be a more accretive use of capital for shareholders.

Analyzing the Financial Engine: ARR and RPO

Critics of Adobe often point to ""decelerating"" growth, yet the numbers tell a story of consistent, low-double-digit expansion on a massive base. In FY2025, Adobe achieved total revenue of $23.77 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth.

The Resilience of Digital Media ARR

Digital Media ARR is the lifeblood of Adobe. It exited Q4 FY2025 at $19.20 billion, growing 11.5%. This is not the profile of a struggling company. Furthermore, the Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $22.52 billion, growing 13% YoY, which provides high visibility into future revenue.

The fact that GAAP EPS growth (35% in FY25) and Free Cash Flow growth (32% in FY25) are significantly outpacing revenue growth indicates that Adobe is a master of operating leverage. The company is becoming more efficient even as it navigates the expensive transition to AI.

Rebutting the ""E-Commerce"" Label

A common critique, often cited from Gartner’s categorization, is that Adobe is increasingly an ""e-commerce platform"" company. However, the data suggests this is a category error. Adobe’s ""Digital Experience"" segment, while a healthy $5.86 billion business, is a secondary pillar to the ""Digital Media"" segment, which accounts for approximately 74% of total revenue.

Adobe is a ""Creative Platform"" that provides the assets for e-commerce, not the transaction engine itself. Its web services are indeed auxiliary to the Creative Cloud. The true value proposition is the ""Content Supply Chain""—the end-to-end process of creating, managing, and delivering the visual assets that power modern commerce. By focusing on ""Agentic Experiences"" and conversational interfaces in Acrobat and Express, Adobe is expanding the utility of its core creative engine into the broader enterprise productivity space.

The DCF Valuation and the Argument for $460

A rigorous valuation of Adobe must account for its historical multiple compression and its future cash flow potential. Using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, we can estimate the intrinsic value based on a normalized growth trajectory.

Given Adobe’s current FCF of approximately $9.9 billion and a projected growth rate of 10-12% over the next five years, the present value of future cash flows suggests an intrinsic value significantly higher than the current market price.

Pessimistic (Bear)

Fair Value Estimate: $271.93

Narrative Assumption: AI commoditizes tools; margins compress.

.

Market Consensus

Fair Value Estimate: $327.65

Narrative Assumption: Current trading price (early 2026).

.

Base Case (My case)

Fair Value Estimate: $460.00

Narrative Assumption: AI drives ARPU; enterprise lock-in holds.

.

Optimistic (Simple Wall St)

Fair Value Estimate: $519.95

Narrative Assumption: FCF growth accelerates to $13B by 2030.

.

The current stock price represents a roughly 30-40% discount to the subjective fair value of $460. This ""margin of safety"" is characteristic of the quality-value plays Howard Marks identifies during periods of extreme market skepticism.

The Path Forward: What Will Flip the Sentiment?

For Adobe to undergo a significant rerating, the ""AI Narrative Correction"" must take place. Analysts will need to see that the ""naked swimmers"" - startups with high burn rates and no operating cash flows - fail to disrupt the established verticals.

Key Rerating Catalysts for 2026

Monetization Clarity: As ""AI-first ARR"" moves from $250 million toward the $1 billion mark, the market will stop viewing AI as a threat and start viewing it as a growth engine.

Margin Stability: If Adobe can maintain its ~45% non-GAAP operating margin while scaling its GPU infrastructure, it will prove the scalability of its AI model.

Agentic Adoption: The success of ""AEP Agent Orchestrator"" in automating marketing for the Fortune 500 will move Adobe from a ""tool provider"" to a ""solution provider"".

Macro-Economic Rotation: A broader market shift back toward highly profitable, cash-generating software companies as interest rates stabilize.

Conclusion: The Resilient Creative Operating System

The current state of Adobe is one of fundamental strength masked by a temporary cloud of technological uncertainty. The company’s healthy balance sheet, elite profitability (ROE of 61.28%), and defensive position within the enterprise content supply chain make it an unlikely candidate for disruption by ""sloppy"" AI tools.

The market’s failure to understand the nuance of the professional creative workflow has created a valuation anomaly. By vertically integrating generative AI into a suite of tools that are functionally indispensable to the modern economy, Adobe is not just surviving the AI wave - it is directing its flow. When the market eventually rerates the stock to reflect its durable cash flows and AI-driven ARPU expansion, the patient investor who recognized the ""overcorrection"" will find themselves rewarded. The subjective fair value of $460 is not a reach; it is a reversion to the mean for a company that remains the undisputed operating system for creativity.",https://images.simplywall.st/company/0c4dbaf8-7855-4d81-b937-e315338b9ecf/cover?size=main-header,N,,2026-01-13 19:01:52.348242

While ride-hailing drivers are subject to the same checks and training, the staff report says oversight is currently provided by companies like Uber, not the municipality.
Sam Austin says the municipality doesn’t require the results from background checks for ride-hailing drivers.
Uber drivers will have to pay an additional $100 every two years after meeting the initial requirements, the company has said.
“When the (ride-hailing companies) came along, regulators threw open the doors and welcomed everybody in,” he said.","HALIFAX — Halifax regional council is reviewing a recommendation for the municipality to provide more oversight for drivers working for Uber and other ride-hailing companies.

Uber has said it's opposed to the proposal, which will be discussed Tuesday at a council meeting, saying it will lead to higher fares, too much red tape and additional fees for drivers.

Last month, council was presented with a staff report recommending that the requirements for all ride-hailing services be brought in line with rules covering all taxi and limousine companies. Under the existing system, taxi and limousine drivers must send the municipality results from training and background checks, which include scans for criminal records, child abuse allegations and a police check for those working with vulnerable people.

While ride-hailing drivers are subject to the same checks and training, the staff report says oversight is currently provided by companies like Uber, not the municipality.

Coun. Sam Austin says the municipality doesn’t require the results from background checks for ride-hailing drivers.

“We don't really have access to that stuff,” Austin said in an interview Monday, adding that he’s aware that Uber is willing to share that information with the local government. “If they already have it all, it shouldn't be too much of a problem for it to be provided to us.""

Austin says more oversight is a must. “There's not always been the best of behaviour … with some of these companies,” Austin said.

“You don't have to (search) much to find challenges. And the taxi industry has had its fair share, too .... I'm always a little bit skeptical of those who say, ‘Don't worry about this, we're handling it,’ when someone has a financial incentive not to handle it.”

A spokesman for Uber could not be immediately reached for comment.

The company's Canadian office has said that its drivers are licensed through the Uber platform and that the city's proposed changes would create redundant training and an additional $135 in fees, resulting in a more expensive service and a slower onboarding process for new drivers. Uber drivers will have to pay an additional $100 every two years after meeting the initial requirements, the company has said.

As well, Uber has said the region's licensing manager already has the authority to request documents regarding Uber drivers to determine if they are complying with all applicable laws.

Brian Herman, president of Casino Taxi in Halifax, says Halifax's proposal is reasonable. “It’s just to ensure that all the drivers that are transporting people for hire have passed the appropriate checks,” said Herman, who leads the largest and oldest taxi company in the region.

“The municipality shouldn't necessarily rely on an independent company to claim that their drivers (have proper background checks).”

Uber Canada has argued the rules in Halifax are already more stringent than in other cities. But Herman challenged that claim, saying the provincial requirements for getting a Class 4 vehicle-for-hire licence were loosened in 2020 to entice Uber set up shop in Halifax.

The need for more oversight in Halifax is part of a wider trend, Herman said.

“When the (ride-hailing companies) came along, regulators threw open the doors and welcomed everybody in,” he said.

“They took the bait that said regulations were not required because a customer can rate a driver (on an app) with a five-star or a one-star. Across the board, people are recognizing that type of process isn't necessarily what it's cracked up to be.”

The proposed bylaw changes, which include making it easier for taxi companies to change their rates, are up for first reading on Tuesday. That means no decisions will be taken by council until the proposals return for second reading at a later date.

January means the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference and all eyes in the pharma and biotech space turn to San Francisco. Our Biomedtracker team is providing daily reports to bring you the highlights of each day’s activities. There’s loads to digest in the full Day One report, so here are a few highlights to whet your appetite.

Day One didn’t deliver a huge haul of large deal announcements, and the message was unusually crisp: concentrate on categories you can lead, fund growth with operating discipline, and use BD&L to fill capability gaps. Here are a few takeaways from the day’s presentations.

Mega caps set the pace

Let’s start with the biggest players. Johnson & Johnson’s Chairman & CEO Joaquin Duato delivered an optimistic outlook, stating that 2026 will be stronger than 2025 as the company is now able to “focus on fundamentals” following the resolution of key policy agreements with the U.S. administration. The company is targeting 5–7% annual growth from 2023 to the end of the decade, and Duato highlighted a dozen launches across innovative medicines and medtech in that timeframe.

Also from the Big Pharma corner, Novartis’ presentation opened with highlights about the company’s strong sales growth and core operating income in recent years (7–15%). The company’s strategy remains unchanged with a focus on four core therapy areas; cardiovascular-renal-metabolic [CRM], immunology, neuroscience and oncology.

Large cap momentum

At the next level, our Day One report features summaries from more than a dozen players, including Alnylam, Biogen, BridgeBio, BMS, Gilead, Pfizer and Sanofi.

Alnylam unveiled its “Alnylam 2030” strategy, built on three pillars: scaling with discipline and agility, achieving global TTR leadership, and growing through sustainable innovation. The presentation highlighted Alnylam’s leadership in the ATTR-CM market, which represents a significant unmet need with over 300,000 patients globally and 80% still undiagnosed.

Biogen President and CEO Christopher Viehbacher emphasized the company’s ongoing multi-year transformation. He highlighted Biogen’s evolution from a declining multiple sclerosis (MS) driven business to a diversified neuroscience organization, now focused on rare disease therapies and a revitalized pipeline.

Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences used his session to reaffirm Gilead’s enduring leadership in HIV treatment and prevention and unveiling what he described as the most robust clinical and launch pipeline in the company’s history. He also focused on Gilead’s long-term vision to sustain HIV leadership well into the 2040s, anchored by a diversified portfolio and extended market exclusivity for cornerstone therapies.

Next wave builders

The mid-cap and small-cap companies featured during Day One include CRISPR Therapeutics, Sarepta Therapeutics, and Xenon Pharmaceuticals.

The gene therapy space has been in a tough spot for the past few years, but CRISPR Therapeutics has charted an ambitious course for 2026, underpinned by the commercial momentum of its first approved therapy, CASGEVY, and a broad clinical pipeline.

Sarepta Therapeutics presented a mission driven outlook for the year ahead. CEO Doug Ingram opened by underscoring the company’s focus on precision genetic medicine for rare diseases. The company enters 2026 from a position of both financial strength and operational momentum. It now holds leadership in precision genetic medicine with marketed products delivering over $1.86B in 2025 revenue.",https://www.evaluate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_data.png,N,,2026-01-13 21:59:45.543105

The year began with the US military capturing Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The consequences for Venezuela’s oil and chemical sectors have yet to play out, but it’s likely that an appreciable ramp up in oil production, which the Trump administration desires, won’t happen soon.

Iran may be a different story. Street protests have created possibly the greatest challenge to the Islamic Republic since 1979. Regime change in Iran seems possible. From an industrial perspective, such a change in that country could be more consequential than in Venezuela. Iran produces several times more oil. It is also a large petrochemical producer. And beyond Iran, the Persian Gulf region includes Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Instability caused by a political crisis in Iran could cripple the world’s economy.

Not to be outdone, the US has been increasingly hectic. The Donald J. Trump administration has pulled out of more than 60 international organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And Trump’s Department of Justice is investigating the Federal Reserve chairman, a move that is being interpreted as an escalation of a row over interest rates.

Unigel to shut down Brazilian styrene plant

Blaming an oversupplied market, the Brazilian chemical maker Unigel Participações is suspending operations at a styrene and toluene plant in Cubatão, Brazil. The site has annual capacity to make 120,000 metric tons of styrene. Unigel also operates a larger styrene plant in Camaçari, Brazil, and polystyrene plants in Guarujá and São José dos Campos, Brazil. “The Company’s decisions were taken in the context of an unprecedented downturn cycle in the global chemical industry, marked by a significant oversupply of petrochemical commodities, which has intensified since 2023 due to the expansion of international production capacity, particularly in Asia,” Unigel says in a statement (PDF). The firm says it is preserving the facilities in the event that conditions are one day right to restart operations. Unigel filed for bankruptcy in São Paulo last October.

Verdant Specialty Solutions has acquired a Lubrizol facility in Elmendorf, Texas, that produces chemicals used in oil and gas drilling and processing, including hydrogen sulfide scavengers, scale inhibitors, and corrosion inhibitors. The site includes a research and development laboratory, application testing capabilities, and pilot-scale facilities, Verdant says in an announcement of the deal. Lubrizol obtained the facility in 2014 when it acquired Weatherford International’s oil field chemical business. Lubrizol divested other parts of that business a few years later but held onto the Elmendorf plant. Verdant was formed in 2021 after the private equity firm OpenGate Capital bought Solvay’s amphoteric surfactant business. The South Korean firm Samyang Holdings acquired Verdant 2 years later.

Tsubame starts up low-pressure ammonia plant in Japan

The Japanese start-up Tsubame BHB says it has begun trials at a small commercial facility that produces ammonia in a low-temperature, low-pressure process. The Haber-Bosch process used to produce almost all ammonia today operates at high temperatures and pressures. Tsubame, a 2017 spin-off from Tokyo Institute of Technology, uses an electride catalyst technology that involves ruthenium nanoparticles. The pilot plant, capable of producing 500 metric tons of ammonia per year, was built on an Inpex site in Japan. The ammonia raw material hydrogen is also produced at that site by reforming natural gas and capturing by-product carbon dioxide.

Syensqo and Axens form solid-state battery joint venture

The specialty chemical maker Syensqo and the chemical engineering firm Axens have launched a joint venture called Argylium to commercialize sulfide-based solid-state battery electrolytes in Europe. Firms working on solid electrolytes say that the class of materials is safer and more energy dense, and can charge faster than today’s cells, which rely on liquid electrolytes. Synesqo is bringing the chemistry to the partnership. The firm, the former specialties business of the chemical maker Solvay, has been working on solid sulfide electrolytes for more than 10 years and is already producing batteries with the technology on a pilot scale at its facilities in France. Axens, meanwhile, will provide its expertise in process scale-up, the firms say.

Critical Metals starts construction on Greenland rare earth project

The specialty mining company Critical Metals has begun building a facility in Greenland that will extract rare earth elements. The first steps are a pilot plant and storage facility in Qaqortoq, a town near the southern tip of the Danish territory. The firm’s contractor, 60° North Greenlands, is scheduled to have the buildings ready to receive production equipment by May. Rare earth elements are critical for the production of high-strength magnets and electronics used in electric vehicles, weapon systems, and a wide range of other civilian and military applications. The island’s rare earth resources are a central element in a current transatlantic crisis created by US president Donald J. Trump. Just hours after the US military captured the president of Venezuela on Jan. 3, Trump began demanding that Denmark turn Greenland over to the US and threatened to take it by military force. On Sunday, he told reporters that “one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland.”

Basecamp and Nvidia collaborate on AI for gene therapy, antimicrobials

Basecamp Research has announced that it has developed a family of artificial intelligence models named EDEN (environmentally derived evolutionary network) that have designed entirely new enzymes for programmable gene insertion in human genomes, along with new antimicrobial peptides and a synthetic microbiome. The AI models were developed in collaboration with Nvidia, Microsoft, and several academic labs. Nvidia also funded Basecamp as part of a preseries C. The research has been released publicly as a preprint on bioRxiv but has not yet been peer-reviewed (2026, DOI: 10.64898/2026.01.12.699009).

LNP maker and RNA firm team up

Vancouver-based lipid nanoparticle (LNP) firm Acuitas Therapeutics has acquired a majority stake in the Montreal firm RNA Technologies & Therapeutics (RNA T&T), which was founded in 2022 for the design and small-to-midscale production of RNA. But RNA needs a fatty delivery vehicle to get it where it needs to go. An Acuitas LNP technology delivered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, for example. The companies say they have collaborated since RNA T&T launched and that the new deal will speed up the optimization of RNA payload and LNP carrier for a variety of therapeutics. But while the deal will allow third parties to easily engage experts from both companies to develop next-generation RNA-LNP therapies, the firms will continue to operate independently.

Lilly and Nvidia to invest $1 billion in a joint AI lab

Eli Lilly and Company and Nvidia have joined forces to launch an artificial intelligence–based drug discovery laboratory in the San Francisco Bay Area. The companies plan to invest $1 billion over the next 5 years in the infrastructure, talent, and computing power of what they call a “co-innovation” lab, Lilly says in a press release. The facility will enable experts from both companies to collaborate using Nvidia’s BioNeMo platform to generate AI models that accelerate drug discovery. Lilly says the laboratory’s initial focus will be to enhance its agentic AI capabilities to enable round-the-clock automated experimentation. Last year, the two companies collaborated to build the most powerful supercomputer in the pharmaceutical industry.

Boltz and Pfizer announce partnership

The team behind a Massachusetts Institute of Technology artificial intelligence platform has launched Boltz, a public benefit corporation with $28 million in seed funding, and partnered with pharma giant Pfizer. Boltz’s flagship program, Boltz-2, combines protein-folding prediction and small-molecule-binding prediction. Boltz-2 was developed in partnership with Recursion Pharmaceuticals. It is open source, but under this new agreement, Boltz will train new, exclusive models on data from Pfizer, and its scientists will collaborate on Pfizer programs to create new models and workflows.

Lilly to acquire Ventyx for $1.2 billion

Eli Lilly and Company will buy Ventyx Biosciences in a deal worth around $1.2 billion. Ventyx develops small-molecule therapeutics for inflammatory conditions, such as NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors. It takes a wide view of inflammation, approaching the process as a driver of disease across the cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological arenas, among others. Ventyx has two NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor candidates in clinical trials. It also has two non-NLRP3 candidates for inflammatory bowel disease in clinical trials, including its most advanced candidate, tamuzimod.

It would be a funny 2D chess move if Intel actually would manage to steal the market now with Battlemage, so by the time the AI bubble flops (hopefully 2027, if war does not happen first), AMD draws a blank and nVidia prices the SUPERS too high to make sense.

Literary impossible due to Nvidia software lock-in. Intel could came out with cards that are faster and cheaper and they'd still barely sell any due to the fact that Nvidia has the entire software ecosystem wrapped around their finger. This isn't the CPU market where you can make a better product and start gaining marketshare (and even in the CPU market Intel still owns a majority of the market thanks to it's leverage of OEMs to unfairly hamper AMD in sections of the market).

“This year marks an historic moment,” said Passikoff.

“Expectations are rising faster than brands are improving. Consumers want more from brands across every touchpoint, and they reward brands that deliver,” he added. “Long-time loyalty leaders are being challenged by brands that better anticipate and deliver what matters most to consumers.”

These leaders are proving that loyalty is the most powerful driver of profitability. Loyal shoppers are also leading to operation cost savings and higher profitability, according to the report. For example, retention costs remain 17–25 times lower than acquisition costs – a 26% increase since 1997.

A 5% increase in loyalty can now yield up to 88% higher lifetime profits per customer, and a 2% rise in loyalty can deliver as much as a 29% reduction in across-the-board marketing and operational costs, the survey said.

“These dynamics are why loyalty’s correlation with market share remains so strong – 0.87,” said Passikoff. “Loyal customers are six times more likely to engage, repurchase, and amplify brand messaging. The bottom line: loyalty moves markets.”

Barclays ( (GB:BARC) ) has provided an update.

Barclays PLC has continued executing its share buy-back programme, repurchasing 2,544,993 ordinary shares on 12 January 2026 on the London Stock Exchange from Citigroup Global Markets Limited, at a volume-weighted average price of 471.5139 pence per share, with all repurchased shares to be cancelled. Following this latest cancellation, Barclays’ issued share capital will comprise 13,850,049,563 ordinary shares with voting rights and no treasury shares, and since the buy-back began on 23 October 2025 the bank has acquired a total of 68,077,008 shares, a move that reduces share count and may enhance earnings per share while clarifying the denominator for regulatory disclosure thresholds for investors.

Yet, the stock tells a more complicated story, with shares down 24% over the past 12 months and currently trading at a 52-week low. The pressure has come from several fronts, including decelerating Digital Media growth, uncertainty around how quickly AI features can reaccelerate revenue, and a broader cooling in investor appetite for large-cap software names as interest rates stayed higher for longer.

Adding fuel to the fire, ADBE tumbled about 6% today after Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz downgraded the stock from Outperform (i.e., Buy) to Perform (i.e., Neutral). (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here)

Schwartz acknowledged that Adobe remains a strong company, calling it “well entrenched in its customers’ digital creative landscape” with “best-of-breed” products and a growing AI-first business. However, the analyst made it clear that expectations had gotten ahead of reality. The AI-driven rebound in Digital Media growth that he had anticipated “did not play out,” with growth decelerating further over the past year.

One of the key concerns is a lack of near-term catalysts. According to Schwartz, Adobe is likely to see a slower recovery in investor sentiment than other large software peers, partly because pricing power appears to be weakening during the AI transition. The analyst also flagged softer confidence in management based on investor conversations, noting reduced messaging and visibility around long-term targets.

Competition is another growing headache. Schwartz argued that the AI transition has actually weakened Adobe’s moat, as generative AI tools increase the speed of content creation while compressing pricing and intensifying competition. New rivals range from large language model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic to major platforms like Meta and Google, as well as design-focused players like Canva and Figma. In his view, this dynamic risks pushing Adobe toward sub-10% revenue growth in 2026, alongside down-year operating margins.

Finally, sentiment itself has become a headwind. Adobe’s market cap has shrunk sharply over the past year, and Schwartz warned it will be difficult to rebuild investor confidence unless the company delivers faster Digital Media growth, expanding margins, meaningfully higher capital returns, or a clear improvement in sentiment around the name.

So, that’s Oppenheimer’s view. The broader Street, however, is striking a more constructive tone on Adobe. With 16 Buys, 7 Holds, and just 1 Sell, ADBE earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Moreover, the average price target of $454.52 points to ~47% upside over the next 12 months. (See ADBE stock analysis)

Martha spoke during a wide-ranging presentation outlining the company’s competencies and ongoing focuses at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.

Receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, Altaviva is an implantable tibial nerve stimulation (ITNS) that delivers neuromodulation via a small device positioned above the tibial nerve to provide treatment for patients suffering from UUI. According to Martha, around 16 million patients in the US suffer from the condition. Of this patient population, Martha claimed that five million are actively seeking treatment.

“Roughly a 1% penetration of this five million patient pool represents a $1bn revenue opportunity for the company,” Martha said.

Martha went on to highlight that Medtronic is focused on driving Altavita’s adoption with education and awareness initiatives and revealed that Altaviva has seen “significant engagement” and interest since receiving FDA approval.

“Just four months post approval, over 500 physicians have been trained [on applying Altavita],” Martha said.

Noting that the training takes place in-person, opposed to virtually, Martha added that this training requires a significant time commitment – a factor that reflects the interest levels towards Altaviva and represents a “good leading indicator” towards the device’s future potential.

“We’re also planning to launch a direct to consumer awareness initiative to reach the five million patients I mentioned, as well as the balance of the 16 million who just aren't quite comfortable in seeking care for UUI,” Martha added. “But this will come. The stigma is breaking down.”

On 12 January, Boston Scientific announced plans to acquire Valencia Technologies. The deal, for which the terms were not publicly disclosed, will imbue Boston with the California-based company’s eCoin ITNS system for UUI treatment, thereby establishing Boston as a competitor to Medtronic in this space.

Martha also used his presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference to highlight that several of the key markets that Medtronic targets, including pulsed-field ablation (PFA) and renal denervation, have the potential to become multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the near future.

Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $5.31 billion, up 22.4% from the previous year.
BNY’s Asset Balances Increase As of Dec. 31, 2025, AUM was $2.2 trillion, up 7% year over year.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Truist’s fourth-quarter earnings has been unchanged over the past seven days.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BankUnited’s fourth-quarter earnings has been unchanged over the past seven days.","The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s BK fourth-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. Also, the bottom line reflected a jump of 20.9% from the prior-year quarter.

Results have been primarily aided by a rise in fee revenues and net interest income (NII). Also, the company recorded a provision benefit in the quarter, which was a tailwind. Growth in assets under custody and/or administration (AUC/A) and assets under management (AUM) balances further supported results. However, marginally higher expenses hurt the results to some extent.

The reported quarter’s results excluded certain non-recurring items. Considering those, net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.43 billion, up 26.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 for 2025 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.39. Also, the bottom line increased 24.4% from 2024. Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $5.31 billion, up 22.4% from the previous year.

BK’s Revenues Improve, Expenses Rise Marginally

Total quarterly revenues increased 6.8% year over year to $5.18 billion. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion.

For 2025, total revenues were $20.08 billion, up 7.8% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20 billion.

Quarterly NII was $1.35 billion, up 12.7% year over year. The rise reflected the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression.

The net interest margin expanded 6 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.38%.

Total fee and other revenues increased 4.9% year over year to $3.83 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees.

Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.36 billion, up marginally from the prior-year quarter. The rise was due to an increase in software and equipment costs; costs related to professional, legal and other purchased services; sub-custodian and clearing costs; and business development costs.

BNY’s Asset Balances Increase

As of Dec. 31, 2025, AUM was $2.2 trillion, up 7% year over year. The rise reflected higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows.

AUC/A of $59.3 trillion increased 13.8% year over year, primarily reflecting client inflows, higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.

BK’s Credit Quality Improves

The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.30%, down 11 bps from the prior-year quarter. As of Dec. 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $143 million, down 20.1% from the year-ago quarter.

In the reported quarter, the company recorded a provision benefit of $26 million, primarily driven by improvements in commercial real estate exposure and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. In the prior-year quarter, provisions were $20 million.

BNY’s Capital Position Improves

As of Dec. 31, 2025, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.9%, up from 11.2% as of Dec. 31, 2024. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6%, up from 5.7% as of Dec. 31, 2024.

BK’s Share Repurchase Update

In the reported quarter, BNY repurchased shares worth $1 billion.

Our Take on BNY

BK’s global expansion efforts and a strong balance sheet position are likely to keep supporting its top-line growth. Also, a robust AUM balance is another positive. However, concentration risk due to the company’s higher dependence on fee-based revenues and elevated expenses are worrisome.

Martha spoke during a wide-ranging presentation outlining the company’s competencies and ongoing focuses at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.

Receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, Altaviva is an implantable tibial nerve stimulation (ITNS) that delivers neuromodulation via a small device positioned above the tibial nerve to provide treatment for patients suffering from UUI. According to Martha, around 16 million patients in the US suffer from the condition. Of this patient population, Martha claimed that five million are actively seeking treatment.

“Roughly a 1% penetration of this five million patient pool represents a $1bn revenue opportunity for the company,” Martha said.

Martha went on to highlight that Medtronic is focused on driving Altavita’s adoption with education and awareness initiatives and revealed that Altaviva has seen “significant engagement” and interest since receiving FDA approval.

“Just four months post approval, over 500 physicians have been trained [on applying Altavita],” Martha said.

Noting that the training takes place in-person, opposed to virtually, Martha added that this training requires a significant time commitment – a factor that reflects the interest levels towards Altaviva and represents a “good leading indicator” towards the device’s future potential.

“We’re also planning to launch a direct to consumer awareness initiative to reach the five million patients I mentioned, as well as the balance of the 16 million who just aren’t quite comfortable in seeking care for UUI,” Martha added. “But this will come. The stigma is breaking down.”

On 12 January, Boston Scientific announced plans to acquire Valencia Technologies. The deal, for which the terms were not publicly disclosed, will imbue Boston with the California-based company’s eCoin ITNS system for UUI treatment, thereby establishing Boston as a competitor to Medtronic in this space.

Martha also used his presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference to highlight that several of the key markets that Medtronic targets, including pulsed-field ablation (PFA) and renal denervation, have the potential to become multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the near future.",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2026/01/shutterstock_1528056221-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:02:51.192681

A new book from FINN Partners chair global health and purpose Gil Bashe call for leaders across the health, life sciences, technology and policy ecosystems to rethink how care is designed, delivered and experienced. Healing the Sick Care System: Why People Matter (coming out February 1 from Thought Leader Press), says that the current system is not broken because it lacks innovation, talent or investment, but because it has lost sight of the people it exists to serve.

The book draws on Bashe’s experiences in battlefield medicine, health policy, patient advocacy, private equity, and global agency leadership to provide a perspective from the inside out on why well-intentioned systems increasingly fail patients and physicians alike.

“In a time when medicine grows more complex by the day, this book powerfully reaffirms the physician’s role as a trusted partner in every person’s health journey,” said John Whyte, MD, MPH, CEO and executive vice president, American Medical Association. “Gil Bashe reminds us that healing begins with listening, collaboration and compassion. His insights champion a system where health professionals and patients work side by side to achieve better outcomes and a better care experience,”

Here, Bashe lays out the roots of the problems that he sees as keeping the human element out of healthcare:

***

''HOUSTON, we have a problem.""

Launched on April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 was to have been NASA's third lunar landing. Two days into the mission, an oxygen tank exploded, forcing the crew to abandon their plans to walk on the moon and focus on new goals: survival and return to Earth. The explosion crippled their capsule, but critically, it did not silence the radio connection. Because of the open link with Mission Control, the crew was able to assess and solve their problems and develop a plan to bring their command module safely home.

Were it not for that communication system, astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Raise would have tragically perished far from home. Instead, they lived because they were able to talk through their challenges, collaborating with the experts at NASA Mission Con-trol. More than the successes of earlier lunar missions, it was the agency's defining moment, an illustration of why the American space program was so great.

If NASA had operated like today's U.S. health system, Apollo 13 would have ended in tragedy. The experts on the ground would have been trapped in siloed organizations, unable to share information. Even if they had managed to communicate and find a solution, they would have needed ""prior authorization"" from a faceless administrator before acting. By then, the capsule would have burned up on reentry. The same maze of complexity that patients struggle to navigate and that crushes the spirit of health professionals would have doomed three astronauts.

Healthcare, we have a problem.

I first grasped that truth not as a soldier or CEO, but as a child. My uncle had just returned from the Army, and our family gathered to celebrate. Driving us home, he steered through a green light when another car ran a red and slammed into us broadside. I was wedged in the front seat between my uncle and grandmother, my grandfather sitting in the back. In those days before seatbelts, the force of the crash hurled us forward.

I remember sirens, ambulances, and fire trucks. I re-member my grandparents on gurneys in the ER, doctors and nurses rushing forward to care for them. What I do not remember is paperwork, insurance cards, or bureaucracy. Healers were fully engaged, urgent, and present. That was the 1960s.

The contrast with today is unavoidable. Too often, passions are buried under paperwork, metrics, and administrative demands. The system prizes compliance over compassion and process over purpose. Have we lost sight of what matters most: the instinct to heal those who need healing?

This question has defined my life. In my younger years, I was both a paratrooper and a combat medic, driven by a sense of purpose and propelled by urgency. My mission was clear: to help my friends and unit survive. On the battlefield, every decision carried life-and-death consequences. I learned quickly to act under pressure, improvise with limited resources, and never lose sight of the human being in front of me, whether friend or foe.

Years later, I traded the battlefield for the boardroom, but the mission did not change; it simply evolved. I launched and rebuilt health PR agencies, led a global turnaround, served as a private equity portfolio company CEO, and lobbied on behalf of health innovation companies. Each role sharpened my ability to navigate complexity while keeping people at the center. Today, as Chair Health and Purpose at FINN Partners, a purpose-centered global communication agency, I continue to carry the same lesson from combat medicine: communication and clarity save lives.

Full transcript - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK) Q4 2025:

Conference Call Operator: Good morning and welcome to the 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY’s consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Marius Merz, Head of Investor Relations, BNY: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I’m here with Robin Vince, our CEO, and Dermot McDonogh, our CFO. As always, we will reference our Quarterly Update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com, and I’ll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and Quarterly Update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 13, 2026, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.

Robin Vince, CEO, BNY: Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I’ll begin with a strategic update, and then Dermot will take you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter, our outlook for 2026, and our increased targets for the medium term as we look ahead toward the next phase on our journey to unlock BNY’s full potential over the long term. Starting on page three of our Quarterly Update presentation, 2025 was another successful year for BNY. In short, we delivered record net income of $5.3 billion on record revenue of $20.1 billion and generated a return on tangible common equity of 26%. Total revenue grew by 8% year over year. In combination with expense growth of 3%, we drove 507 basis points of positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 411 basis points excluding notable items, resulting in an improved pre-tax margin of 35%.

Consistent execution delivered four consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in 2025, bringing us to eight consecutive quarters overall. Taken together, we grew earnings per share by 28% year over year to $7.40 and returned $5 billion of capital to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. This strong financial performance was the output of our work to reimagine BNY and was enabled by tangible progress across strategic priorities over the past year, which we highlight in the four boxes on slide four. First, our commercial model is working. Operating as one BNY, we are starting to bring the full breadth of the company together to deliver more products and services to meet our clients’ needs.

This includes embedding sales practices and behaviors that enable our teams to deliver more and better for clients with greater consistency to drive deeper relationships with existing clients and open the door to new ones. We achieved record sales performance for the year, and we announced several noteworthy wins in the fourth quarter. Further deepening our relationship, WisdomTree selected BNY as their banking-as-a-service provider for the WisdomTree Prime platform. This solution brings together banking, payments, custody, and digital assets to support the growth of WisdomTree’s new retail distribution model and its strategy on being a leading digital asset forward investment manager. Jupiter, an active asset manager, selected BNY for a suite of capabilities from front to back, from investment operations and data management all the way through to custody, streamlining their operating platform and positioning them for the future.

Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund selected BNY to deliver integrated data and analytics for private markets. This solution aims to help them manage complexity, enhance transparency, and improve decision-making across their growing alternative investments portfolio. Second, we continued to make progress in unlocking the scale and growth potential of our platforms by transitioning approximately half of our people into the platform’s operating model over the course of 2025, which brings us to more than 70% of our people working in the model today. This initiative has been a core component of rewiring BNY to make us more agile and intentional in how we deliver to clients, but forms part of a larger collection of initiatives that are at the heart of running our company in a fundamentally different way. Third, in 2025, we made significant advances in the adoption of AI, underscoring our industry leadership in this burgeoning space.

Built upon very deliberate investments over the past several years, our enterprise AI platform, Eliza, is unlocking capacity for our people, allowing them to focus on higher-value work for our clients. We recently announced a collaboration with Google Cloud to integrate Gemini Enterprise capabilities into our Eliza platform, enhancing our ability to support deep research, analysis, and data-intensive workflows across the company, building on existing collaborations with OpenAI and others. These collaborations underscore our commitment to deploying AI responsibly and at scale. We expect that over time, AI will allow us to remake many of our processes and systems in new and exciting ways, and that together with embedding AI in our products and services represents a significant opportunity for our company in the years ahead.

Fourth, BNY has a rich 241-year history of innovation, from issuing the first loan to the U.S. government to becoming the first U.S. GSIB to offer digital asset custody. Our focus on innovating new products and solutions is centered on building trusted market infrastructure for the long term and serving our clients in new and evolving ways, including increasing delivery of new capabilities connecting the traditional and digital asset worlds. This past quarter, for example, we launched the Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund, a government money market fund designed to support stablecoin issuers and institutional participants to manage eligible reserve assets, providing BNY’s cash and liquidity solutions expertise to the growing digital payments ecosystem. Our recently announced tokenized AAA CLO strategy in partnership with Securitize brings high-rated structured credit product onto the blockchain, with BNY serving as sub-advisor and custodian of the underlying assets.

And just last week, we announced that we have taken the first step in our strategy to tokenize deposits by enabling the on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on our digital assets platform. As we reflect on the scope of our market-leading businesses, our central position as a provider of financial market infrastructure, and the depth and breadth of our client relationships, traditional and digitally native, we believe that we are particularly well-positioned to advance the future of financial markets. From the very beginning of our work three years ago, we have taken a long-term view toward unlocking BNY’s full opportunity as a financial services platforms company, with a commitment to disciplined execution and sustained value creation for our clients and shareholders over time. I’m going to touch briefly on some of the work that has brought us here, described on page five of our presentation.

Two years ago, we communicated our strategic roadmap and a set of medium-term financial targets for what we viewed as the first foundation-setting phase in a multi-year transformation of BNY. While there are elements of that work that will continue well into the future, we consider that this is the right moment to begin to turn the page toward our next phase. But before we get to that, I’ll take the opportunity to reflect on our efforts, the impact that we’ve seen across our businesses and operations, and how this has started to translate into improved financial performance. As we embarked on the journey, we recognized early on that we had to work across several fronts at the same time, simplifying how we operate, improving execution, and delivering for our clients, and that how we did it as a team was essential to creating deep and enduring change.

Thorough strategic and financial business reviews demonstrated to us the powerful combination of capabilities within BNY. We are the number one custodian in the world and the number one collateral manager, the leading provider of issuer services, and the primary settlement agent for U.S. government securities. We operate a top-tier payments and liquidity franchise and offer our clients leading investments and wealth capabilities. Individually, these are market-leading businesses. Together, they represent a set of highly adjacent financial services platforms operating at the center of global financial markets, difficult to replicate at scale and increasingly valuable to our clients. To organize the company around execution, we deliberately framed our work across three simple elements of strategy, which we continue to focus on.

The first was clients, to be more for them, to deliver more of our existing products to our existing clients, to add new clients, to add new products, and to meet clients where they are with solutions tailored to their needs and responsive to market trends and opportunities. The second was on how we run our company. We knew we could do that better, simplifying, improving financial discipline, breaking down barriers, challenging the status quo, and reimagining our operating model as a platforms company. The third was culture. Simple to say, hard to do, but magical when it works. A collective sense of ownership, teamwork, and accountability all coming together to bring the other two key strategic pillars to life. This spirit of ownership and accountability is at the heart of our delivery.

It was important to us to build credibility and momentum through consistent execution toward better business and operational performance, some examples of which you can see on slide six. What has been and continues to be the single most compelling growth opportunity for BNY is doing more business with our existing clients. In 2024, we launched our new commercial model, designed to encourage our sales and service teams to raise their ambition, equip them with new tools, and to enable our people to deliver solutions from across BNY, leveraging the full breadth of our platforms. Over the last two years, the number of clients buying three or more of our services increased by more than 60%, and organic fee growth has climbed to 3%, reflecting good progress with even greater opportunity ahead.

In combination with stronger organic growth, we took steady, deliberate actions to reduce sensitivity to interest rates, driving more resilient top-line revenue growth in a range of macroeconomic environments. At the same time, our ongoing transition and increasing maturity in the platforms operating model is reducing friction and driving further productivity improvements. For example, investments in digitization and automation have meaningfully lowered the unit cost for processes like striking a NAV and settling a trade, and our people are building innovative AI solutions that we expect over time will have a meaningful impact across the company. We’re proud that in 2025 alone, we deployed over 130 digital employees, industry-leading multi-agentic AI capabilities. Our digital employees work alongside our people, supporting them with tasks like validating payment details and remediating code vulnerabilities, allowing teams to focus on higher-value work and client outcomes.

Taken together, these metrics give glimpses into the how of our execution, milestones and examples, not endpoints, but helpful indicators that our strategy is working and that there continues to be meaningful opportunity ahead. Turning to slide 7. By centering the company on positive operating leverage as our north star, we created a clear, intuitive framework for our teams to execute on. The cumulative impact of our steady improvement year after year, while capitalizing on a relatively supportive market backdrop, has resulted in a meaningful improvement in BNY’s financial performance over the last few years. More consistent revenue growth and deliberate expense management have resulted in positive operating leverage, margin expansion, and improved profitability, together driving double-digit annual earnings per share growth. Turning to slide 8.

When compared to BNY’s financial performance over the prior decade, we can see the difference that consistent discipline, clear intent, and sustained execution make over time. More resilient top-line revenue growth has started to build, and better control of our expense base has allowed us to continue to self-fund important investments in future growth. While we’re encouraged by this progress, we are not satisfied. Our work is far from complete. We remain humble and intensely focused on the opportunity ahead. To that point, I’ll wrap up on slide nine with where we are headed next.

With the foundations largely in place and more of the people in their seats to help us execute, the next phase of our journey to unlock BNY’s potential is about realizing scale and growth opportunities across our company as we mature in our new commercial and platform models, unlock capacity using AI, and in so doing, serve our clients in new and better ways, enabling the global financial markets and infrastructure of the future. Taken together, our focus for 2026 and over the medium term represents an exciting shift built on the work done over the past three years to enable higher growth and deliver on the competitive advantages embedded in BNY as we remain steadfast in our commitment to create value for you, our investors. I want to thank our teams around the world for their dedication to our clients and their commitment to reimagining our company.

We are entering 2026 with positive momentum, and we are excited for the work ahead of us. With that, I’ll turn it over to Dermot to take you through the financials for the quarter in greater detail before reviewing our outlook for 2026 and our next set of milestones. Dermot. Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I’m picking up on page 12 of the presentation with our results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $5.2 billion was up 7% year over year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This included 8% growth in investment services fees, primarily driven by net new business, higher market values, and higher client activity. Investment management and performance fees were flat, as growth primarily resulting from higher market values was offset by the impact of the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates we discussed in prior quarters.

Firmwide AUCA of $59.3 trillion increased by 14% year over year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values, and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Assets under management of $2.2 trillion were up 7%, reflecting higher market values and the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows. Investment in other revenue was $135 million in the quarter, including $43 million of other investment losses and $15 million of net securities losses. Net interest income increased by 13% year over year, primarily reflecting the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were flat year over year on a reported basis and up 4% excluding notable items. This reflects higher investments and revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $26 million in the quarter, primarily driven by improvements in commercial real estate exposure and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. Pre-tax margin was 36% on a reported basis and 37% excluding notable items, and return on tangible common equity was 27%. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $2.02, up 31% year over year, and excluding notable items, earnings per share were $2.08, up 21%. Robin touched on our results for the full year earlier, but turning to page 13, I’d like to expand on some of the most important items. We grew total revenue by 8% year over year to a record $20.1 billion for the full year of 2025. Fee revenue was up 6%. We grew investment services fees by 8%, primarily driven by net new business, higher market values, and client activity.

Investment management and performance fees were down 2%, reflecting the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees, partially offset by higher market values and the weaker dollar. Net interest income was up 15%, primarily driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $13.1 billion were up 3% both on a reported and an operating basis. Excluding the impact of notable items, the increase reflects higher investments, employee merit increases, higher revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax margin was 35% on a reported basis and 36% excluding notable items, and return on tangible common equity was 26% for the year. As Robin noted earlier, we reported earnings per share of $7.40. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $7.50, up 24% year over year.

On to capital and liquidity on page 14. Our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for the quarter was 6%, down 9 basis points sequentially. Average assets increased by 3% on the back of deposit growth, and Tier 1 capital increased by $439 million, driven by capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%, up 17 basis points sequentially. Over the course of the fourth quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 100%. Our consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as well as the consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio, remained unchanged at 112% and 130%, respectively. Next, Net Interest Income and balance sheet trends on page 15.

Net interest income of $1.3 billion was up 13% year over year and up 9% quarter over quarter. Like the year-over-year increase discussed earlier, the sequential increase was primarily driven by the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Average deposit balances increased by 4% sequentially, reflecting 4% growth in interest-bearing and 1% growth in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average interest-earning assets were up 3% quarter over quarter. Cash and reverse repo balances increased by 4%, loans increased by 5%, and investment securities portfolio balances increased by 2%. Turning to our business segments starting on page 16. Security services reported total revenue of $2.5 billion, up 7% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 11%. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 11%, primarily reflecting higher client activity and higher market values.

Asset servicing continues to show strong momentum as clients increasingly access the breadth of capabilities across our platforms to help them evolve their operating models. Sales wins over the course of the year showed broad-based growth across products and segments, with particular strength in custody and with alternative asset managers, banks, and broker-dealers, a testament to our targeted investments in the fastest-growing segments of the market. ETF AUCA of $3.8 trillion ended the year up 34% year over year, reflecting growth from the more than 2,500 funds serviced on our platform, which was up 22% year over year. Alternatives AUCA were up 10% year over year, including double-digit growth in private markets. We continue to invest in capabilities to support our clients’ growth, including in retail alternatives with solutions spanning custody, fund services, corporate trust, FX, and hedging.

Broadly speaking, approximately half of all asset servicing wins this past year represented multi-line-of-business solutions, reflecting the growing effectiveness of our new commercial model and client demand for consolidating with trusted partners. In issuer services, investment services fees were up 12%, primarily driven by higher client activity in depository receipts, and in our corporate trust business, we’re pleased with the momentum across our franchise and see significant multi-line-of-business opportunities ahead, especially with corporate and municipal clients. We maintained our number one position in conventional debt servicing, and in CLOs and munis, where we hold number two positions, we increased our market shares by 4 and 3 percentage points year over year, respectively. In security services overall, foreign exchange revenue was down 3% year over year, reflecting lower spreads on the back of lower volatility, partially offset by higher client volumes.

Net interest income for the segment was up 8% year over year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were flat year over year, reflecting higher investments and revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, offset by efficiency savings and lower litigation reserves. Security services reported pre-tax income of $838 million at a 30% increase year over year and a pre-tax margin of 34%. It is worth highlighting that for the full year of 2025, security services reported a pre-tax margin of 33%. That was an improvement of 4 percentage points year over year and exceeded the medium-term target of equal to or greater than 30% that we established for this segment in December of 2021. Next, Markets and Wealth Services on page 17. Markets and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.8 billion, up 8% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 4%.

In Pershing, investment services fees were down 2%, reflecting client activity in the prior year quarter related to the deconversion of lost business, partially offset by higher market values. Net new assets were $51 billion in the fourth quarter, representing healthy growth from both new and existing clients. Over the course of 2025, we earned numerous wins from new $1 billion-plus wealth firms, and the business accomplished several multi-year contract renewals with key clients. Our commitment to serving multi-billion-dollar growth-minded wealth firms across a full suite of custody, clearing, lending, investment products, and wealth services is met with interest from existing and new clients. And we remain focused on capitalizing on the important opportunity to enable growth for breakaway advisors as their platform of choice.

For example, this past quarter, 71 West Capital Partners and VestGen Wealth Partners selected BNY Pershing to provide custody and clearing for their new independent full-service or RIA firms. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees increased by 15%, reflecting broad-based growth in collateral balances and clearance volumes. Average collateral balances of $7.5 trillion increased 15% year over year, and average settlements exceeded $1 million per day in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher market activity and new clients on our platform. Against a supportive backdrop from continued issuance and demand for U.S. Treasuries, we’re focused on innovating solutions that help our clients optimize capital, meet evolving regulatory requirements, scale operational efficiency, and access market infrastructure and liquidity. In our payments and trade business, previously called Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 3%, primarily reflecting net new business.

Over the course of the year, this business has shown strong performance on the back of broad-based growth across products and regions. Solid growth and sales wins over the course of the year, enabled by our strategic investments in capabilities and talent, give us good momentum into 2026. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 20% year over year. Segment expense of $930 million were up 9% year over year, reflecting higher investments and revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and higher severance expense, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Markets and Wealth Services segment reported pre-tax income of $882 million, up 9% year over year, and achieved a pre-tax margin of 49%. Turning to investment and wealth management on page 18. Investment and wealth management reported total revenue of $854 million, down 2% year over year.

Investment management fees were up 1%, driven by higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by the impact of the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates, which I mentioned before. Segment expenses of $703 million were flat year over year, as the impact of higher investments and the weaker dollar was offset by efficiency savings. Investment and wealth management reported pre-tax income of $148 million, down 14% year over year, and a pre-tax margin of 17%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.2 trillion increased by 7% year over year. In the fourth quarter, we saw net outflows of $3 billion, including $23 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $20 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth management client assets of $350 billion increased by 7% year over year, reflecting higher market values.

Over the past year, we’ve worked hard to bring our investment and wealth management business closer to our other BNY platforms, streamline operations, and build towards stronger top-line growth, including by making several key strategic hires. We expect that 2026 will be the year in which this work will start to translate into improved financial performance. I’ll close with our financial outlook. Page 21 shows the current expectations for 2026. Notwithstanding a very dynamic operating environment, positive operating leverage continues to be our North Star, and so we have set ourselves up for another year of more than 100 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2026. This reflects our current expectation for total revenue, excluding notable items, to grow by approximately 5% year over year in 2026, market dependent, and accordingly, a plan for approximately 3%-4% growth in expenses, excluding notable items.

Specific to the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, and on taxes, I’d like to note that over the course of 2026, we expect a quarterly tax rate of approximately 23%, with the exception of the first quarter, in which we currently expect to see a tax benefit from the annual vesting of stock awards. Finally, turning to page 22 for our outlook for the medium term. Two years ago, we communicated our first set of medium-term financial targets, which were to improve BNY’s pre-tax margin to equal to or greater than 33%, and our return on tangible common equity to equal to or greater than 23%, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Today, we are raising the bar.

We are increasing our pre-tax margin target by 500 basis points to 38%, and we are increasing our return on tangible common equity target also by 500 basis points to 28%. These new medium-term financial targets represent the next milestones on our path to unlocking BNY’s full potential over the long term. What remains unchanged is our commitment to prudent balance sheet management, and with it, our philosophy for capital deployment and distributions. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio management target remains unchanged at 5.5%-6%, and we will continue to manage ourselves conservatively to the upper end of that range for the foreseeable future. Robin talked about our strategic priorities for this next phase on our multi-year transformation of BNY earlier.

These new medium-term financial targets are a reflection of our confidence in the solid foundation we’ve built over the past few years, and they demonstrate our determination to continue driving positive operating leverage as we realize greater scale and growth opportunities across our platforms. And with that, Operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad now. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. We’ll take our first question from Ibrahim Punawalla with Bank of America. Hey, good morning. Morning, Ibrahim. Hey, Robin. I guess maybe first question for you, Dermot, on the guidance, especially when we look at the revenue growth. Just annualizing your fourth quarter NII gets you to about 9% growth on the NII side.

So if you don’t mind unpacking that a little bit around what are the assumptions underpinning that revenue growth outlook and on fees as we think about 2026. Thanks. Okay. Good morning, Ibrahim. I hope you’re well. So let me start with saying this year we’re doing it slightly differently. We finished the year with $20.1 billion of revenue, and the performance over the last three years has given us confidence to guide top-line growth. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the guide that we’re giving to you for 2026 is up 5% plus or minus year on year on the top-line revenue. Now, underneath that, you have both fees and net interest income. And I’ve said previously that Q4 is a good jumping-off point, but December was a particularly strong month for us in NII.

So the way I would think, the way you should think about NII for us this year is a little bit ahead of 5%, fees maybe a little bit lower than 5%. So all in, top-line growth up 5%. Understood. That’s helpful. And I guess maybe one bigger picture question just around as we think about these strategic targets. Maybe, Robin, your thoughts. I guess the one missing piece here is how would you want the Street to think about, I guess, the medium-term earnings growth potential for BNY? And within that construct, for whatever reason, if the revenue growth environment worsens, your level of confidence in defending the margins and the ROTCE targets that you’ve upgraded today. Thank you. Sure. So look, I’ll take it. It’s kind of got two parts. I’ll take it both parts of that.

But first of all, on the growth targets, look, we’ve said all along the positive operating leverage is our North Star, and we’ve also said that there’ll be different components to achieving that in any year. And I think it is important to note that. And that’s one of the reasons why, as Dermot just said, we’ve sort of moved to the total revenue guide because we recognize it’s sort of a compositional question. But what you should be able to hear from us, certainly in our prepared remarks, is a bit of an increased conviction inside the company about our ability to win and grow. And we’ve certainly been setting internal aggressive sales and revenue targets to be able to do that. But to your question, we’re certainly humble about the fact that we’ve got to be careful around any particular assumptions on market environment.

And this is where I come back to the fact that we’re all risk managers at heart. We’re sort of projecting out a lot of different potential scenarios. And so we take very seriously the fact that we’ve got to have levers to the extent that the markets might end up disappointing. And so we’ve created agility in our expense base. And that’s been part of our work over the course of the past three years: the platform’s operating model work, the work that we originally did around some of the efficiency savings, making choices, and the fact that we’ve now got the rhythm of saying, ""Hey, we could actually make different choices on business development expenses, compensation if needed, the investment book of work."" And so this agility is extremely important.

But I’ll just also recap with a reminder of the fact that we’ve also deliberately positioned the platforms inside the company and the whole company to trying to reduce the macro sensitivity to the world. And so you’ve seen that in NII. We actually specifically called it out in the presentation. But if you look at the different cylinders of the revenue engine of BNY: equity market values, fixed income market values, equity market transaction volumes, fixed income market volumes, government issuance, private sector issuance, capital markets activity, GDP growth, payments, software, services, execution and clearing generally, fixed income and equities. That is all very deliberately positioning ourselves to be able to be more resilient. But then, of course, to your question, to the extent that things happen, we can still react to them. That’s how I think about it together.

We’ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. As part of your new hire targets, how much does your thought about tech and AI play into that? And specifically as it relates to AI, you certainly got our attention. You have over 100 digital employees. How many of those AI digital employees do you expect to have over three to five years? And what’s the savings from them? And again, how does that play into your new hire targets? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Look, AI, we think, is super important. We think it’s just going to be able to be a catalyst for transformational change. We think that’s true for the world. One of the most important evolutions in a technology, frankly, in hundreds of years, is the way that we think about it.

And so given that, it’s very hard to project very clearly exactly where we’ll be one, two, three, four, five years from now. And so there’s always the risk that we haven’t properly and fully incorporated it into our medium-term targets because while we’ve thought about it, it’s hard to look into the future that clearly. But the way that we think about AI, and maybe this will be helpful therefore, is we think that the technology has already gotten to a level where it can have a very significant impact, frankly, on all of us individually and companies, and certainly here at BNY. And if that follows, then we think it follows that adoption and integration risk becoming the limiting factors. So what we’ve focused on is the real cultural side of it. Making AI for everyone, everywhere, and for everything at BNY is our mantra.

We launched our AI hub in 2023. That was just after the ChatGPT moment. We now have an enterprise AI platform, ELIZA, that’s general intelligence model agnostic, and it supports this multi-agentic functionality that underpins the digital employees that you referenced, and then we’ve put in place the resources to support that to really enable the scaling of it. That’s all of the GPU compute. We’ve got our own NVIDIA hardware and tech, but we’ve also got the collaborations with Google that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and OpenAI and others, and then the culture point, again, and you’ll see this, it sort of resonates through the whole set of transformation and rewiring concepts that we’re talking about for the company. It’s as true for AI because if AI is this great capability, it’s a superpower. It can therefore be a capacity multiplier for our people.

And so that’s what is causing our people to be able to pull AI towards them, hence the digital employees working side by side with our people. Now, it is early days. We will continue to give you mark-to-market in terms of how we’re making progress on this, but we are short-term enthusiastic, medium-term excited, and long-term believing that it will have a significant positive impact. That was helpful, so I get it. The enterprise, the Eliza scaling culture, you’re excited about it, but could you put a little bit more meat on the bones if you could? What do you have? 134 digital employees today. And what does that equate to in savings? And where do you think that number goes to? Or just a little bit more detail if you could. Hi, Mike. It’s Dermot here.

If you review the materials on page six of our financials presentation, you’ll see over the last couple of years that our headcount has trended down a little bit, but that’s not really anything to do with AI yet. We talk about, internally, AI is unlocking capacity. We don’t think about it in the narrow definition of efficiency. It’s all about growing with clients, increasing revenues, and optimizing the potential for our employees, so you have to think that over time, AI as a superpower, as Robin just said, is going to increase revenues, create capacity, and allow us to do more with existing resources, and over the last couple of years, we’ve been doing this right since the get-go in terms of enterprise-wide strategy. We’ve been quite constrained in our spending, and we’ve been very disciplined. We continue to spend more on cyber resiliency than we do on AI.

So the return for our money is very, very high from what we’re getting from the enterprise today. And so we only see upside from here. We’ll move to our next question from Ken Houston with Autonomous Research. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. Guys, I wonder if you can detail a little bit the pre-tax margin improvement, the five points. Can you go through kind of each of the businesses and talk us to how your individual business line pre-tax margin thoughts are evolving within that too? Where do we get the most juice? Okay. Thanks for the question. So if you kind of go back to 2023, we delivered an actual performance pre-tax margin of 30% and ROTCE of 22%. And back then, when we initially established the medium-term targets, we went for 33% and 23%. And now we’re going with new medium-term targets today of 38% and 28%.

So you see real progression there over the last three years. And also today, as I mentioned on the first question from Ibrahim, you see us guiding for the first time top-line revenue growth. Previously, we guided by business. You will have seen us guide four years ago on security services, and we’ve kind of surpassed that guide. And so that really speaks to the power of the BNY transformation that we’ve been doing over the last three years. We have three segments: security services. We see upside in corporate trust. We see upside in depository receipts. We feel that asset servicing over the last three years has really transformed in terms of growing revenues, taking advantage of efficiencies, and driving pre-tax margin. So that kind of disciplined focus on expenses is allowing us to better price for business to win in asset servicing.

Markets and Wealth Services is the most akin to a platform’s at scale that we have at the moment. As the rest of the firm matures in the platform operating model, the pre-tax margin there is roughly, give or take, around 50%. We would expect to grow that pie at that margin. And so the upside from there on that segment was probably a little bit muted. But in investment and wealth management, where we’ve guided 25% and we finished last year at roughly 17%, that’s where we see the most opportunity in 2026 and beyond as we kind of begin to see the green shoots of recovery in that segment come back. So BNY overall delivering for clients.

As Robin said in his prepared remarks, 64% increase in clients buying from three or more lines of business in the last three years, 10% of new logos coming to the firm last year as a percentage of sales. The clients are noticing what we’re doing and want to do more with us. Remember, there’s a compositional thing here as well, Ken, because if you think about the combination of corporate trust, depository receipts, payments, trade, CCM, and Pershing, which are kind of the platformy businesses that Dermot was talking about, that now represents about two-thirds of the PTI of the company. Three years ago, that was just 55%. There’s a bit of an averaging here given the fact that those are the segment, MWS, and the businesses, they’re actually growing the fastest inside the company. Actually, as a percentage of the whole, they’re growing.

And that’s a factor here too. Yep. Got it. And just to follow up, Dermot, on your point about how December was a strong month for NII, you guys have done a very good job kind of consistently being conservative about your NII outlook. What would you say about the fourth quarter? Was it deposit balances? Was it pricing? What were the elements that may not run rate forward relative to your exit? So Q4 really was balances held in quite nicely. And we always say that we don’t lead with deposits. And really, NII is an output as a result of franchise activity. And in Q4, we had very strong activity in our asset servicing business, which caused balances to outperform in the last few weeks of December, and that caused the outperformance.

I would just think that just as you’re continuing to push, as you mentioned just before, why wouldn’t that just be a better organic hold on just activity and overall balances? So if you kind of take balances overall, for 2026, we expect balances throughout the course to be roughly flat. Q4 is normally our strongest quarter on balances. Q3 is usually the seasonally slowest. And you would expect over the next couple of quarters to moderate down slightly. When we think about the 5% plus, it’s really around the asset side of the balance sheet where we have securities kind of rolling off, and we’re reinvesting at kind of 100-150 basis point pickup. So we’ve narrowed the range of the cone of outcomes as it relates to interest rate volatility.

Balances we expect to remain roughly in line are flat, and the pickup will come from assets rolling off into higher yielding securities. Okay. Got it. Thank you, Dermot. Appreciate it. That’s right. We’ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Morning. So Robin, wanted to start with a question on your newly launched tokenized deposit capabilities and was really hoping you could speak to institutional demand for the offering, what has been some of the early feedback. And as the effort scales over time, how might your monetization approach differ versus some more traditional deposit gathering activities? Sure. So look, I just sort of step back from the whole thing because this really is part of the overall digital asset opportunity. We see global financial markets as transforming, moving towards more of an always-on operating model.

And we’re in the business of moving, storing, and managing money. And so we think we’re particularly well-positioned to connect the traditional and the digital rails to really be able to enable clients. And so our roadmap has really been, right from the beginning, focus on the innovation, be able to bring the capabilities online, that first with digital asset custody, stablecoin enablement. You just mentioned the tokenized deposits. And so that allows us to be able to serve both the new digital native clients, who, by the way, want the new digital services, but they also want some of the traditional services from us. So we’re enabling both with them. And it also allows us, with our existing clients, to be able to help them to be able to move into this world.

For instance, as a client might want to open up a new share class in parallel to their traditional share classes, maybe they want to open up a tokenized share class, we can do that as well. It really is these two things working in concert that we think unlocks new possibilities. We see the value of the improved efficiency, reducing friction that is real value here. When you click in, stablecoins and tokenized deposits are just two examples of all of that. Stablecoins providing the on-chain settlement currency, which is very necessary and is, frankly, because their stable value probably better than some of the other alternatives. Of course, there are choices there in the stablecoins. Tokenized deposits really improving the internal utilization of cash.

And so for a client making a deposit with us, we can actually improve the usability of that deposit. It becomes sort of programmable, if you will, and it allows that money to be able to work harder and faster for them to be able to facilitate other activities. And ultimately, might in fact create the opportunity for clients to be able to do more things with us anchored around some of those types of activities. Thanks for the fulsome response, Robin. And for my follow-up, maybe for Dermot, just on the clearance and collateral management business, you’ve delivered four consecutive years of double-digit fee growth in that area, exited this year growing 15%. Given expectations for a meaningful uptick in treasury issuance, how has that informed the outlook for the business? Is this double-digit growth rate sustainable?

What are some of the factors that could potentially derail some of the recent momentum? Great question. The way I would think about this is, as you rightly pointed out, the growth rate over the last couple of years has been quite nice to see. We would say the growth rate from here probably a little bit more modest compared to previous years. We have the treasury clearing mandate coming in, which we expect to kind of influence some of the things that go on there. In the U.S., I would say more treasury issuance, a little bit more stable than we’ve seen in the prior couple of years because, you know, volumes, etc., etc., are beginning to moderate. Where we see some of the growth opportunities is outside the U.S.

And we’ve said that on prior calls where we’re continuing to invest in new products and services around the world. So we expect to continue to grow internationally and moderate in the US. That’s great color. Thanks for taking my questions. We’ll take our next question from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Hi. Good morning, everybody, as well. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to zoom out a little bit and talk about the fee revenue outlook as a whole. You guys updated the organic revenue growth for 2025, which looks like came in at 3%. Some businesses are doing better, some doing a little worse. And the ones where you’re seeing strength, particularly things like security services, sounds like that momentum is continuing.

Then in things that are slower, when I think about pricing, maybe your asset management, there are some idiosyncratic things that you pointed to that should improve. As you think about organic fee growth into 2026 and beyond, any way to frame what that could look like? Thanks for the question, Alex. I really would look at and study page six of our presentation. There are two graphs that I particularly like on that page. One is the deeper client relationships where you can see that over the last three years, we’ve grown clients who are buying from more than three or more lines of business has increased by 64%. Then when you pivot over to the middle page, you can see that 2022, flat organic, 2023, flat organic, 2024, 2%, and 2025, 3%.

Then that gives us the confidence to be able to guide 5% to the top line of $20.1 billion. And as I said in an answer to an earlier question, 10% of our sales last year was with new logos. And when you listen to Robin and his answer to the previous question on digital assets, more clients are coming to us because they want thought leadership. And as a consequence of thought leadership in new spaces, frontier products, we’re doing stuff in traditional services. So the short answer to your question is it’s the portfolio effect of delivering BNY to a broad range of clients. Robin said three years ago, we have a client list that’s the envy of the street. We pretty much service most of the S&P 500.

And so clients are seeing the change that’s happening at the company, and they want to do more with us. So I would say no one business is doing better than the other. Everything has upside. Everything has opportunity. As it relates to Pershing specifically, I’m pleased to say that the last couple of years, I would have said on most calls, the word deconversion due to M&A activity, that’s largely behind us, which reinforces why we feel confident that we continue to grow now at mid-single digits for net new assets. So we feel good about Pershing and the opportunity that’s in front of us there. And also, as I said in the answer to a previous question, we feel we’ve turned a corner in IWM, and 2026 is the year that we’re going to begin to see the transformation as we’ve brought that business closer together with BNY.

And Alex, I’ll just add one thing, which is, and I understand because we’ve talked about this a bunch over the course of the past couple of years in terms of, okay, where’s the growth going to come from? How are you really thinking about it? We’ve talked before about the alpha and beta that we see in the overall business model. And so I just want to remind you of the beta point. Dermot touched on it related to digital assets, but just remember there are quite a few mega trends that we think can be quite interesting tailwinds for the company. And so the question is, have we positioned the company in the right way and all of our business platforms to really be able to serve clients as it relates to those various different trends?

So just very briefly to tick through them, capital markets, the growth in capital markets, issuance, trading, movement of assets. Think about it, corporate trust, our payments and trade business, depository receipts, they line up very well with that particular trend. Alternatives and our ability to support clients, alternative clients end-to-end, private market assets, again, corporate trust, asset servicing, very much playing in that space. Wealth, very important segment. Pershing, wealth, investments are all significant players in participating in the growth of that mega trend. Digital assets, which we talked a bunch about already, and that, again, many of our businesses aligned to enabling that. The growth of fixed income, which Dermot touched on, that’s relevant not only in the obvious ways, but also in the financing private markets, data centers, U.S. Treasury borrowing.

And then the big one, outsourcing, clients wanting to focus on what they’re really good at and asking us to step in because of the breadth of what we can do to do some of the one-stop shopping, being a trusted provider and really giving us that opportunity to serve them more comprehensively. So when you think about that backdrop, we have not only the alpha of all of the individual work that we’re doing internally, but we’re also positioning to be able to take advantage of that. We think the combination of the two things is pretty interesting. Yep. No, I agree with that. And definitely like the direction where things going on that chart six or slide six. For my follow-up, guys, real quick on the buyback, I don’t think I heard you guys talk about the capital return plans for 2026, 2026 specifically.

And then just broadly, when you think about the growth algorithm at the firm, your medium-term targets, obviously, you gave us margins and the return of capital. But as you think about the share repurchases and the total return of capital, how does that play out over the next couple of years? So big picture, Alex, our capital philosophy remains unchanged. As you both know, Robin and myself, we like to run to the upper end of our tier one leverage ratio. A lot of uncertainty in the markets the last couple of years. The outlook is going to be a little bit uncertain. So we like to kind of be in that kind of 6% zip code of tier one leverage ratio. And when you step back from it, what is BNY? It’s a capital light balance sheet with very clean balance sheet, very liquid balance sheet, capital generative.

Over time, we’ve consistently returned earnings to our shareholders. And so we expect that to continue. And when you kind of solve for the model of what we’ve guided for 2026, it’s going to be consistent. So the buyback number as a percentage is really an output to all the things that we’ve talked about earlier. So it’s going to be in that kind of 95%-105% range. And so we don’t really feel that it’s necessary to guide on the buyback anymore given the overall algorithm and the model that we have for the future. Yep. Perfect. Thank you guys very much. Thanks. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawkin with BMO Capital Markets. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I actually have a question on organic growth as well. And thanks for all the color given. So you generated 3% organic growth last year.

Your assumptions and your outlook are that organic growth would accelerate. Markets are flat, but yet the fee revenue outlook is sub-5%. So this is kind of two possible outputs. Conservative outlook, or was there some over-earning or one-time items that might have elevated the baseline that you’re growing off of when we think about 2025 into 2026? So look, organic growth in 2026 versus 2025, I think if you go back to page six and you see the impact that the commercial model is having, right, on the two graphs of organic fee growth and deepening client relationships, the story is quite compelling. And so we continue to hire new talent. The commercial model is not even two years old.

So we continue to bring in new talent around the world, and we continue to raise the ambition of what we want to do with clients across a wide range of services. So I would expect higher organic growth this year, which reflects the flywheel of the new commercial model and also new product development and the culture that we’ve kind of changing over the last couple of years at the firm. We haven’t really mentioned this, but we have hired a new Chief Product and Innovation Officer who’s been with us a little bit over a year. And we would expect a similar impact on the product side of the house that we’ve had on the commercial side of the house. So we feel quite good about the outlook for organic growth to 2026. No, no. I totally appreciate that.

My question is, if the organic growth is going to accelerate, markets are flat, how do we end up with sub 5% fee revenue growth? And correspondingly, if you’ve got organic growth, I might as well just throw in my follow-up now. Why would balances be flat? Don’t balances tend to move with organic growth as well? So shouldn’t that move with organic growth? Or was there something in the baseline that might cause those two metrics to diverge? You framed the question at the beginning as, were we over-earning? We don’t think we’re over-earning. We think we are being thoughtful in the way that we’re positioning the outlook for 2026. We see, of course, variability on each of the inputs to the total revenue actually overall line. But we recognize that it could come a little bit more or less with NII.

It could come a little bit more or less with the organic fee growth. Of course, no one quite knows what’s going to happen with markets, which is why we’re sort of making what we think is a reasonable baseline assumption there. So you’re doing the math, and we’re kind of agreeing with you. We’re not quite exactly sure how the composition is going to come, but we feel pretty good about the guide. Excellent. Okay. Well, look forward to seeing that organic growth continue to grind higher. So it’s a great outcome. Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Good afternoon. I’m all set. All my questions have been asked and answered. Thanks so much for the time today. Thank you, Betsy. We’ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Thanks. I’ll just do one small one.

We’re getting long in the tooth here. So I heard your comments about the deconversion and purging running its course, and I agree. Just taking a step back, there’s been a ton of consolidation in the space, except there’s also a lot of PE ownership. There’s a lot more consolidation to come. And so I’m curious if you’ve looked underneath the covers to see your book of business and how high up in the table it is, meaning do you service a lot of the consolidators or the consolidatees in the future? Because there’s going to be more. And then I worry a little bit about, not that I agree with it, but in the past, sometimes when they get big enough, they think they can insource and do it themselves. I’m just curious if you could talk a little bit about any part of that. Thanks so much.

Okay. Thanks for the question, Glenn. I see us playing a very significant role in what is a very big market. We are a $3 trillion player in this space, and we believe we have the products, we have the talent, and we have a right to play in this space. And we’ve seen that over the last 12 months where, and I’ve said it in our prepared remarks, we’ve had contract renewals with big players. We’ve had a couple of breakaway clients in the fourth quarter that we’ve onboarded, which I said in my script. And so we feel like we’re going to do as well as anybody else in this space, and we have the tools and the solutions, and clients are happy with Wove. They like Wove. We’ve invested. We’ve more than 50 clients on that platform now.

We continue to grow revenue, and we continue to bring in talent to be able to drive the business forward. And so we kind of think maybe for the next couple of quarters, you won’t see necessarily the M&A that’s been seen in the last few quarters as people are digesting those transactions. And so there has to be a kind of a pause for digesting, and our pipeline is robust and healthy. Great answer. Thanks, Dermot. We’ll move to our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities. Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Your new medium-term targets aren’t too far ahead of the adjusted performance of the past quarter. Could you just go into some more details about why you feel like these are sufficiently ambitious given the opportunities set in front of BNY over the next three to five years?

You pretty much hit your targets that you set in January 2024 for your full year 2024 adjusted results. So I hear you about conservatism and the importance for humility across a range of market backdrops, but what can you share to show us why the bar has been set high enough for the next few years? Okay. So I was expecting this question. So as you who gets to ask it, the way I would answer it, if you go to page 22 of our highlights presentation, when we were at end of ’23, pre-tax margin was at 30%, and we went with medium-term targets of 33%, and 22% on ROTCE, 23% was the medium-term target.

I think you appreciated that ambition and liked the targets, and it was doing it for the first time and said, ""Okay, BNY is kind of raising the bar on itself."" So now we close the year quite strong, and we’re going with 38 and 28 for three to five years out. So again, we’re going to stay. We’re going to do that over time through the cycle. And so a lot of things can go in a different direction. It’s going to be non-linear, and we’re raising the bar. Every day, we’re trying to outperform that, but we’re setting maybe think of that as a floor to our ambition, and we’d look to outperform it. So we feel like it is stretchy for the firm given where it is in its transformation, and we’re always going to look to outperform those targets. Thank you.

Just as a follow-up, it’s great to see the improvement in client relationship depth with clients who work with three-plus businesses, up 64% versus two years ago. Can you give us any sense of the number in absolute figures? Is it a single-digit percentage? Three or more businesses at BNY right now? Is it the majority? Is it somewhere in between? Where do you want this to get to over the medium term? Thank you. So one of the things that I haven’t said is last year, we had two individual record sales quarters. So I would say it’s all across the firm, and we’ve had three consecutive years of year-on-year growth in core fee sales. And so when you look about that in the context of a commercial model that’s not even two years old, then you have to feel optimistic about the future.

60% of new clients buying from three or more lines of business, and 10% of sales in 2025 were clients that are new to BNY. That is some of the points that Robin made about the new products where clients are coming to us for thought leadership, and while they’re with us and talking to us, they’re doing traditional services. We’ve seen a 20% increase in annual sales productivity. I think the hustle and energy within our commercial organization is palpable, and clients really want to talk to us about doing more with us. Also, the last point I’d make on this is over the last three years, we’ve roughly spent $500 million each year investing in the firm and providing improved client service, improved solutions, improved product.

And you can see that particularly showing up if I was to pick one business or one segment, you see it showing up in security services, which is really where we’ve really outperformed on the margin. And so we see a real flywheel of momentum there, and we expect that to continue going forward. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Good afternoon, Robin. Robin, can you give us a bigger picture? You guys have obviously put up very strong organic growth numbers, and that’s the focus. But when you think about opportunities to grow through acquisitions or inorganic growth, is there any areas that have an interest to you? I know you’ve done a small deal a couple of years ago, and all the focus, again, has been on organic, which has been fabulous. But what about inorganic or acquisitions?

How do you think about that? Sure, Gerard, so look, let me just start with just bringing you back to our remarks because I do think this is a very important context for M&A because there are a lot of different reasons why folks can do M&A, and one of them is obviously when they absolutely need to go do something because they’ve run out of runway themselves in some respect, and I think our headline is that our organic transformation is working and has started to show tangible results, and we think we’ve got strong momentum and the runway to create more value here for clients and therefore for shareholders over the near, medium, and long term. We’re certainly open-minded about inorganic opportunities if they can accelerate, de-risk, or enhance our value proposition.

But we do feel that we have a lot of optionality here because we’ve got the momentum from what we’re already doing. We feel good about that organic path. And so we don’t have any pressure to do M&A. And that’s very important because we think that when you look out and see the reasons why various different folks do M&A, it’s not always for the best reasons. And so that optionality, we think, is a very real thing. Now, in terms of the philosophy, there’s no change to it. So M&A, if done well, can be a powerful tool in the toolkit. We’re certainly open to things. We look, and Dermot said this before, ever since last summer when there were all these rumors in the market, we’ve had a lot of bankers calling us with inorganic opportunities.

So we see the flow, and we’re in touch with it, which is good. But for us, it’s going to be about good discipline, alignment with strategic priorities, strong cultural fit, attractive financial returns, and the bar is definitely high. It would have to make a lot of sense because, as I said, we don’t feel like we need to do it. But that’s sort of collectively how we think about it. Very good. And just to tie into that, in the markets you operate, what are the markets that are the most robust? Is it domestic U.S.? Is it Europe, Asia? Because obviously, you’re global. You’ve got a good feel for that. Where are you guys seeing the best growth and the best opportunities for growth? It’s interesting.

This is going to sound like I’m not going to give you a satisfactory answer to the question because it really is all of the above. The U.S. is the biggest market that we operate in. If you want the split, it’s approximately 40% outside of the U.S. So we feel like we’ve got a good global balance. But the U.S. obviously has got a lot of opportunity for us, and a lot of our platforms have seen the growth. But actually, last year, the fastest growing in percentage terms region was actually Asia. So clearly, there’s opportunity there as well. And I would say historically in Europe, we might have been a little bit underpenetrated. So there’s real opportunity there as well. So I wouldn’t really break the opportunity down on geographic lines.

And as Dermot said, we don’t really break it down on business lines either because we see opportunity and pathway in each one of the businesses, albeit for very different reasons. And that really ties back to this point about the different things going on in the market, these mega trends, whether it’s capital markets, private markets, etc., that I talked about before. So this is a critical part of how we’re thinking about the company. We are deeply invested in making the company work more effectively, the agility, the platform’s operating model in terms of how we run the place. We’ve deeply invested in the commercial model so that we can actually get more and more out of the businesses that we have, this great breadth of businesses to deliver to clients, including in more combinations and more solutions, which is exciting. Dermot mentioned product and innovation.

That’s exciting because that’s about new products in the same way as he mentioned new logos earlier on, and so all of those things come together for us, we think, to be able to drive opportunity, which is one of the reasons why when we sit and look at what we have, going back to the beginning of the answer to your question on M&A, we feel like we’ve just got a lot of opportunity with what we’ve got to make more of it. Very good, and then, Dermot, a quick question on slide six as you refer to one of your favorite graphs, the deeper client relationship graph. I don’t think you mentioned this, but if you did, I apologize. What percentage of the customers are now taking more than three products or three businesses?

Or is there still enormous room for this to continue to grow at this rate because you just haven’t deeply penetrated all of the customer base at this level? So I would say a lot more room for improvement. It’s a momentum. It’s a cultural transformation. It’s a de-siloing of the firm. In some ways, we’re kind of turning a page here today on phase one to phase two, but the work is never done. And so we think there is more upside, more training, deeper integration of the businesses. We kind of like if I just give you one specific example, asset management can do a lot more with Pershing than what it does today. Asset management can do a lot more with asset servicing than it kind of does today. And the leadership of those three businesses are beginning to see that opportunity.

We have great manufacturing capability in asset management. We need to deliver that to the rest of the firm and their BNY clients. Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Gerard. We’ll take our next question from Emily Erickson with Citigroup. Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask first on the expense side of things. You’re guiding to 3%-4% for 2026. So take the midpoint of that. Comes in somewhere near where you guys printed for 2025. But we’re talking about flat markets right from year-end. Is the way I kind of square, I guess, that difference with some of the market-related uplifted expenses expected to kind of recede the balance between what you’re able to harvest in efficiency savings relative to the incremental investments, the $500 million from 2025? How should I think about that particular balance on the expense side of things in the 2026?

I’m looking at page 21 of the financial presentation, Emily. Look, for the first time this year, previously, we’ve guided some operating leverage and positive operating leverage. Today, we’re coming out and saying it’s going to be greater than or equal to 100 basis points. Over the last few years, I think we’ve managed to establish some credibility that we are very good stewards of our expense base, very good financial discipline. We’ve harvested roughly $500 million a year for each of the last three years, and we’ve reinvested that in the business to grow. It’s really about the 3%-4% guide for 2026. That continued investment in the business in a very agile and dynamic way gives us then the confidence to be able to guide to the top-line growth of 5%.

So it all starts with top-down, where we kind of say we want to solve and deliver positive operating leverage to you. And then, as a consequence of that in the budget season, then we’re going to go through the bottoms-up planning analysis, and we arrive at this model that gives us this flex on the expense side. Got it. Okay. And then just on the NII side of things, right, you’ve talked about breaking out that 5% on total revenue a little better if we look just at the NII piece. How much of that, or can you sort of walk through the drivers of where NIM goes from here? I know you have the reinvestment impact on the security side of things, but you also pointed to some deposit margin compression in 4Q.

Is there room for significant NIM expansion to support that 5% plus on the NII side? So I’m not too sure what your definition of significant is, but I would expect over the course of 2026 for NIM to grind higher from where it is today. Got it. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. Oh, hey, thanks. My question on capital was asked and answered, so we can end it here. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, David. And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you, Operator. And thanks, everyone, for your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well. Thank you.

This does conclude today’s conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time today. Have a great day.

Delta Air Lines Stock Looks Ready to Fly to New Highs

President Glen Hauenstein said Delta’s strategy has helped diversify revenue into higher-margin sources, with diversified revenue streams representing 60% of total revenue in 2025. He reported that premium revenue grew 7% for the year, cargo revenue increased 9%, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) revenue rose 25%. Total loyalty revenue improved 6%, while travel products continued to grow at double-digit rates.

Hauenstein also highlighted the performance of Delta’s co-brand relationship with American Express. He said American Express remuneration grew 11% to $8.2 billion, supported by a fourth consecutive year of more than 1 million new card acquisitions and double-digit year-over-year co-brand spend growth in every quarter. Looking ahead, Delta expects high single-digit growth in co-brand remuneration in 2026 and reiterated a longer-term goal of reaching $10 billion within the next few years.

During the analyst Q&A, management said premium demand remained strong, while the Main Cabin recovery has been slower. Hauenstein said Delta “has not really seen main cabin move yet,” adding that movement in Main Cabin would be a factor that could support results toward the higher end of guidance if it materializes in 2026.

Outlook: March quarter growth and fiscal 2026 targets

Executives said fiscal 2026 has started with strong booking momentum. Bastian said Delta set a new record for bookings “last week,” with cash sales up double digits on top of last year’s strength. Delta forecast March quarter revenue growth of 5% to 7% year over year, supported by what the company described as improving consumer and corporate demand and a healthier supply-demand environment as “unprofitable flying is rationalized.”

Janki guided to March quarter earnings of $0.50 to $0.90 per share and an operating margin of 4.5% to 6%, both expected to improve year over year. For the full year, Delta projected earnings of $6.50 to $7.50 per share, free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of two times by year-end.

Management cautioned that early-year booking strength is still limited in duration. In response to an analyst question about guidance sensitivity, executives said it was “the second week in January” and warned that the industry’s volatility in 2025 remains a reminder to remain cautious when projecting outcomes.

Capacity: Hauenstein said Delta plans to grow capacity about 3% for the full year, with all new seat growth concentrated in premium cabins, driven by interior upgrades and new aircraft deliveries.

Costs: Janki said non-fuel cost performance is expected to remain within Delta’s “low single digit” long-term framework, though first-quarter non-fuel CASM growth is expected to be modestly above the full-year average due to fleet preparation for peak summer.

Capital spending: Delta plans $5.5 billion of capex in 2026, including about 50 aircraft deliveries and ongoing investment in customer experience and technology.

Fleet and strategy: Boeing 787 order and international expansion

Delta announced an order for 30 Boeing 787-10s with options for 30 more, with deliveries starting in 2031. Bastian said the aircraft would enhance the international network and extend long-haul capabilities. Janki said next-generation wide-body aircraft can deliver up to a “10 points margin advantage” over the aircraft they replace, with more premium seating, improved fuel efficiency, and expanded cargo capability.

In response to questions, Hauenstein said the 787-10 order supports both growth and replacement, particularly for the 767-400 fleet, and also adds diversification to Delta’s wide-body and engine mix. Executives also reiterated plans to expand internationally in 2026 and beyond, including growth in Asia and Middle East markets, while continuing to use joint ventures and a strong domestic foundation to support network expansion.

Leadership changes, operations, and reporting updates

Bastian said Hauenstein will retire next month, and Joe Esposito has been elevated to Chief Commercial Officer. Esposito told analysts Delta’s core strategies are not changing and that the airline plans to “dig even deeper” into integration across network, pricing, loyalty, products, and merchandising.

On operations, Bastian said Delta continues to lead on reliability metrics, citing Cirium recognition as the most on-time airline in North America and a number one Net Promoter Score among major airlines. However, he acknowledged the airline is working to improve recovery from irregular operations, pointing to post-COVID changes and pilot contract-related complexities as contributors to recovery challenges.

Delta also said it will change aspects of its financial reporting. Janki said the company will provide additional detail on its third-party MRO business, separating MRO from non-fuel unit cost metrics to preserve visibility into core airline cost trends. He described MRO as a “unique Delta capability” and said the company is optimistic about growing the business beyond the $1 billion revenue level over time, with potential to reach $2 billion and then $3 billion in revenue, while improving margins from high single digits toward the mid-teens.

On capital allocation, management reiterated that debt reduction remains the top priority, while noting opportunities to expand shareholder returns as leverage declines. Janki referenced dividend growth and said the company expects to utilize an existing share repurchase authorization over its timeframe, while remaining focused on paying down debt in the near term.

In an-in-depth report published on Monday, UBS noted the competitive strength of tech giants such as IBM (IBM).

Quantum computing works on a subatomic level and uses exotic technologies, like supercold superconductor chips. Quantum computing aims to solve problems too complex for today's classical computers, such as simulating chemical reactions. Traditional computers use electronic circuits to store information as digital zeros and ones. Instead, quantum machines rely on processors known as ""qubits.""

Qubit-based computing can be prone to errors from small environmental disturbances and other factors. For quantum computing to reach its potential, logical qubits will require robust error correction. The race is on to build ""fault-tolerant"" quantum computers that scale up and correct errors, allowing for complex, sustained calculations.

There are many approaches to quantum computing, including qubit technologies that use superconducting, ion-trapped, annealing and photonic methods.

Quantum Computing Stocks: Tech Giants Loom

While IBM and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google are pursuing superconducting-based quantum technology, IonQ (IONQ) is developing trapped ion systems, the UBS report noted.

""Who will win out will depend largely on the modality of qubit that succeeds first,"" said UBS analyst Madeleine Jenkins in a report.

""As it stands we see superconducting and trapped ion as the most advanced, with Google leading in software/quantum error correction. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are more diversified, offering mixed modalities (from pure plays) over cloud computing. Public pure plays with thematic exposure include IonQ, D-Wave, and Rigetti, alongside private companies such as IQM and PsiQuantum.""

JPMorgan, Jefferies, Evercore ISI, Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities in 2025 initiated coverage on some quantum companies while Barclays and Bank of America published in-depth reports on the emerging technology.

Quantum Computing Stocks: Xanadu, Infleqtion

So far in 2026, D-Wave Quantum (RGTI) shares have climbed roughly 13%. Quantum Computing (QUBT) has popped about 14%.

Quantum computing stocks have been volatile since late 2024 when a Google announcement sparked a big rally. However, uncertainty over commercialization and competition from tech industry giants have been key issues. Nvidia (NVDA) has offered differing views.

Further, photonic quantum computing firm Xanadu in November announced plans to go public via a SPAC deal with Crane Harbor Acquisition (CHAC). Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, raise money in an initial public offering with the purpose of acquiring companies.

Startup Infleqtion also plans to go public via a SPAC deal with Churchill Capital Corp X. IonQ, Rigetti and D-Wave went public via the SPAC route in 2021 and 2022.

Fourteen U.S.-based chemical manufacturers landed on the International Chemical Secretariat’s annualTop 40 ChemScore report in November, with only one company cracking the top five.

Developed by the International Chemical Secretariat, or ChemSec, the rankings focus on how the world’s largest chemical producers are managing their transition to safer, more sustainable substances,according to the nonprofit’s website.

ChemSec measures a chemical company’s performance based on four metrics: transparency, phase-out of persistent chemicals, product portfolio and safer solutions.

The nonprofit changed its methodology for the latest rankings. Possible points have increased from 48 to 100 over the four metrics. Additionally, “times are changing” and ChemSec has adapted to the current chemical climate, Jerker Ligthart, senior chemicals expert at ChemSec, said in avideo explaining the results.

Furthermore, ChemSec got rid of the “easy points,” which Ligthart said required very little effort to achieve and did not display differences between the entities.

“We wanted to show the difference between a good company and a not- so- good company, and that is kind of the whole point,” Ligthart said.

14 U.S.-based companies’ rankings on ChemSec’s 2025 ChemScore report

Ecolab placed in the top five, while Chemours placed last with zero points

Ecolab

Ecolab scored high on the list at No. 4, with 35 points for its plans to phase out the use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicalsby the end of 2026. Ecolab, which manufactures cleaning substances for industrial, food safety and healthcare settings, confirmed that it is removing all chemical products that the company makes with intentionally added PFAS from its global portfolio.

“In these times of [President Donald] Trump, this is an American company with good sustainability DNA, that is not afraid to do the right thing, is blunt and outspoken in public, and is moving forward,” Sonja Haider, head of sustainable finance at ChemSec, said in a statement.

Ecolab declined to comment on the ChemSec ranking, but it confirmed that all chemical products that the company manufactures with intentionally added PFAS will be removed from its global portfolio.

“As public health concern has grown over the use of PFAS, Ecolab is often asked questions regarding its use of these substances in our chemical products,” the company said in its PFAS position sheet. “Ecolab’s PFAS position is part of our commitment to provide clear and transparent product information to customers and stakeholders.”

However, the company said it will seek fluoropolymer alternatives when they become commercially available. Ecolab will also replace the materials when a “robust technical” alternative has been established and proven to meet performance requirements.

Additionally, Ecolab offers technologies that remove PFAS from water and is asking its suppliers to develop PFAS-free alternatives for its pesticides.

“Investors tell us: ‘You can’t achieve anything on sustainability in the US’. The example of Ecolab shows this is false,” Haider said.

Chemours

Chemours placedlast on the ChemScore report, with zero points. ChemSec said the manufacturer has corresponded with the nonprofit regarding its chemical management system and code of conduct. Chemous offers a few safer alternatives and has worked to reduce waste, but those were “easy points” that almost all companies were awarded for.

“Now it is more apparent, from a chemical pollution perspective, that Chemours is in danger of becoming a stranded asset,” the nonprofit said in its report. “It is burdened with a legacy portfolio of hazardous substances.”

Chemours said in an email that it actively engages with rating organizations to share its sustainability progress as well as the essential role its chemistries play in industries worldwide.

“Our overall performance in sustainability rankings continues to trend positive and we continue to score well and improve in several of the most recognized ratings, including EcoVadis, MSCI, ISS, and Bloomberg,” the company said in a statement.

Chemours said its chemical products are used in industries such as energy transition, semiconductors, defense systems, aerospace, medical devices. The company added that there are “often no viable non-PFAS alternatives” offering the same performance, reliability, and safety needed for these critical applications.

“These essential chemistries can be made responsibly, which is why Chemours has made and continues to make significant capital and technological investments to reduce PFAS discharges from our sites as part of our commitment to responsible manufacturing,” the company said.

“Chemours also has a deep, longstanding commitment to innovation,” Chemours added. “While there aren’t suitable replacements or alternatives for many of the critical applications of the chemistries we supply right now, we are constantly innovating to improve our chemistries and uncover potential alternatives that don’t compromise quality or performance for our customers.”

Other companies

Other companies on the list of those phasing out PFAS include 3M, which was set tosunset the forever chemicals by the end of 2025. However, the companyranked No. 32 with only eight points. ChemSec gave the chemical manufacturer no points for transparency, its product portfolio and lack of safer solutions,according to the nonprofit’s report.

3M did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Honeywellplaced 36th with only six points for its product portfolio. Honeywell said in an email that itcompleted its chemicals business spinoff in October, which is now called Solstice Advanced Materials.

DuPontranked at No. 21 with 13 points.

“We will let the ranking/score speak for itself and do not have any additional comment,” the company said in an email.

PPG Industriesplaced 30th with nine points.

“PPG remains committed to reducing our environmental footprint to better serve the evolving needs of our customers and improve operational efficiency,” the company said in an email statement. “As part of this, we recognize the importance of chemical safety and transparency. PPG remains in compliance with chemical disclosures within all regions where we operate.”

The other U.S.-based chemical companies on the ChemScore did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other companies on the ChemScore outside the United States have made plans to sunset PFAS in its production. Germany-based BASF ranked atNo. 8 with 23 points, as it’s also phasing out PFAS use.

“Considering the need to maintain high safety and environmental standards, BASF calls for substituting the use of PFAS in industrial equipment,” the company said in a statement regarding itsPFAS position.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eSTFSZnfKcDHSiWJPtM14uuSWT1Po_mfeMAlfKabIUQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODI1NTkzNTMyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-13 15:05:02.044555
ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-13 17:51:22+00:00,PC Gamer,Nvidia's long-awaited N1X Arm chip for consumer PCs spotted in a near retail-ready Dell laptop,Jeremy Laird,,,,,https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-laptops/nvidias-long-awaited-n1x-arm-chip-for-consumer-pcs-spotted-in-a-near-retail-ready-dell-laptop/,"But now it's been spotted in a shipping manifest configured in a 16-inch Dell laptop.
N1X almost certainly refers to Nvidia's Arm chip for consumer PCs, the existence of which has been confirmed by no lesser an authority than CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang.
That obviously implies that the Dell laptop with the Nvidia chip was nearly ready to ship.
That latter issue, specifically operating system and software support, is surely the biggest challenge facing any Arm chip for the PC.
So, an Nvidia Arm chip for the PC remains an exciting but thus far elusive prospect.","Nvidia's N1X Arm-based CPU has been a long time coming. But now it's been spotted in a shipping manifest configured in a 16-inch Dell laptop. So, is it just about to launch? Possibly not.

Twitter user @Olrak29_ spotted a reference to a ""Dell 16 Premium"" with ""N1X"" in a shipping manifest listing on the NBD Trade Data website. N1X almost certainly refers to Nvidia's Arm chip for consumer PCs, the existence of which has been confirmed by no lesser an authority than CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang.

Further intriguing information in the listing includes the phrase ""engineering technical samples for R&D purposes"" and the entry ""DVT"". The latter refers to Design Validation Test, which generally means a feature and function complete version of a product.

Indeed, we've had ""DVT"" versions of laptops as official review samples from some brands. They often only need a firmware update to be identical to retail shipping products.

That obviously implies that the Dell laptop with the Nvidia chip was nearly ready to ship. But there are a few catches. First, this manifest listing is actually from November 20 last year. And yet nothing has been launched.

Moreover, the laptop listed has Dell's 2025 ""Premium"" branding. And Dell has just announced at CES that it is returning to its XPS brand for 2026 laptops with small ""p"" premium market positioning.

There's a strong implication, then, that Dell had this laptop inked in for a 2025 launch, but something has caused it to be delayed or even cancelled. We previously reported in July that the N1X had indeed been delayed due to multiple factors.

One was the need to revise the chip itself. But ""delays in Microsoft's operating system roadmap"" were also sited.

That latter issue, specifically operating system and software support, is surely the biggest challenge facing any Arm chip for the PC. For now, it's not clear exactly what specifications N1X will have. If it's based on the same GB10 ""superchip"" used in the Nvidia DGX Spark box, then it could have an iGPU with the same specs as an RTX 5070 desktop GPU.

But whatever the exact spec, expectations will be high when it comes to gaming performance and that will demand excellent OS support including some kind of translation layer.

Such a thing currently exists, of course, in the form of Windows on Arm and the Prism translation layer. The problem is that has been specifically tuned for Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips. So, a version built specifically for Nvidia's N1X would be required. And maybe that has been delayed.

Anyway, all we know absolutely for sure is that Nvidia has confirmed that an Arm chip for the PC is coming, but that it has yet to appear. So, an Nvidia Arm chip for the PC remains an exciting but thus far elusive prospect.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eko8Vu3jdf5vxqZAEZfE59-1280-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:02:55.810281

AI, particularly generative AI and agentic AI, seems to be the latest breakthrough technology to demonstrate Amara’s Law.
Rather, they reveal that we are still in the first phase of Amara’s Law: overestimated impact.
Amara’s Law and the Gartner Hype Cycle both point toward the same conclusion: we need to think longer term.
While each AI journey will look a little different, here are some important steps organizations can take to start realizing the full potential of AI: Amara’s Law is just one of the indicators that AI is reaching an inflection point.","Throughout 2025, AI dominated headlines and keynote slots — and the hype shows little sign of slowing down. There are bold predictions about productivity gains, promises of transformation across industries and almost every app now has some kind of AI-assisted feature.

But as with any technological shift of this scale, it isn’t always smooth sailing. AI still suffers from hallucinations and bias. Plenty of pilots have failed. And many businesses are still struggling to achieve the ROI they expected. Consequently, there is growing speculation that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble.

The reality is that tech predictions almost always miss the mark, especially when they concern something as far-reaching as AI. Amara’s Law gives us a useful way to visualize why this is the case.

Old predictions about the future can often seem absurd in hindsight. In 1959, the U.S. Postmaster General predicted that mail would be delivered from New York to Australia in a matter of hours… using guided missiles. Futurists in the 1960s and 1970s expected us to have robot butlers, flying cars and personal jetpacks by now.

But for every overly optimistic prediction, there’s a doubting voice that has been proven emphatically wrong. In a 1966 edition of Time magazine, “remote shopping” was predicted to flop. In 2003, Steve Jobs stated that the subscription model for music was “bankrupt.” And in 1995, Bob Metcalfe, co-inventor of Ethernet, predicted that the internet would collapse. He famously (and literally) ate his words at the International World Wide Web Conference just two years later.

As president of the Institute for the Future (IFTF), Roy Amara was very well acquainted with tech predictions and hype cycles. In 1978, the Boston-born futurologist observed a pattern that is now known as Amara’s Law:

“We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”

This observation has played out time and time again. Perhaps the best example is the internet. Short-term overestimations led to the dot-com bubble. But 25 years later, the internet has had a greater impact than most could have imagined in the ‘90s. Mobile phones, social media and cloud computing all followed a similar trajectory. AI, particularly generative AI and agentic AI, seems to be the latest breakthrough technology to demonstrate Amara’s Law.

These statistics indicate a mismatch between the enthusiasm for AI and the ability to extract value from it. But they don’t tell the whole story. Failed pilots and a lack of ROI don’t automatically mean that AI is broken or not fit for purpose. Rather, they reveal that we are still in the first phase of Amara’s Law: overestimated impact.

This is partly due to what I call “Artificial Confidence” — a tendency to put too much faith in the capabilities of artificial intelligence without laying the necessary groundwork. This happens for two main reasons. First, AI is so versatile that it can feel like a cure-all solution. Second, companies fear they will get left behind if they are not quick to adopt AI.

We have seen numerous high-profile blunders: support chatbots misleading customers, fictitious citations appearing in published work, and developers generating code that contains vulnerabilities. Failures like these are not always bugs within the AI itself. They are symptoms of trying to force a short-term rollout without the long-term infrastructure to support it. AI is a tool; its effectiveness depends on how it is wielded.

Amara’s Law and the Gartner Hype Cycle both point toward the same conclusion: we need to think longer term. As with any groundbreaking technology, the true potential is only revealed once we have transformed the structure around it. Electric cars are not much use without a sufficient charging infrastructure. Smartphones wouldn’t be as useful without an ecosystem of apps to expand their functionality.

We’re witnessing the same dynamic with AI. Employees using generic AI tools without guidance are unlikely to see meaningful productivity gains. Even customized, task-specific AI solutions will fail to move the needle if existing workflows don’t adapt. The real long-term value is in redesigning processes and roles around AI-human collaboration, not just replacing people.

While each AI journey will look a little different, here are some important steps organizations can take to start realizing the full potential of AI:

Amara’s Law is just one of the indicators that AI is reaching an inflection point. The short-term impact may have been overestimated, and there will surely be many more failed pilots along the way. But in the long term, AI will influence our lives in ways that no one can yet predict. The organizations that will emerge as winners are the ones who take a considered approach, build the right infrastructure and invest in quality assurance.

For now, the best approach is to test your AI solutions in the real world, with real people and diverse datasets to get feedback on the quality of responses. This will help you identify and remediate bias, toxicity and hallucinations so you can release AI-driven products with confidence.

ID43,Uber,2026-01-13 17:41:23+00:00,The Indiana Lawyer,"Bill would shield Uber, Lyft from liability lawsuits stemming from drivers' crimes against passengers",Cameron Shaw,,,,,https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/bill-would-shield-uber-lyft-from-liability-lawsuits-stemming-from-drivers-crimes-against-passengers,"Legislation filed in the Indiana General Assembly would prohibit future civil lawsuits against ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, for crimes or other misconduct committed by their drivers against passengers.
Uber says vicarious liability has been “weaponized” by plaintiffs’ attorneys to hold corporations responsible for the actions of independent contractors.
Uber attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing that Indiana’s transportation network statute establishes Valadez as an independent contractor, thereby exempting Uber from his actions.
Johnson said that if HB 1417 were to take effect before the civil case is wrapped up, it appears Uber would gain complete immunity from the plaintiff’s claims.
“Our citizens are the ones taking the risk, and shareholders of Uber and Lyft get all the reward,” he added.","Legislation filed in the Indiana General Assembly would prohibit future civil lawsuits against ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, for crimes or other misconduct committed by their drivers against passengers.

House Bill 1417, authored by Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, would prohibit individuals from suing transportation network companies for damages caused by a driver or arising from a ride arranged through the platform. The provision is part of a broader tort reform package aimed at limiting liability exposure for all businesses and curbing certain types of civil claims.

If enacted, the measure would prevent future cases similar to the civil action now pending in Marion Superior Court against Uber following the 2024 murder of Indianapolis resident Chanti Dixon by an Uber driver who was also accused of sexually assaulting the woman.

San Francisco-based Uber did not directly respond to questions about whether it considered the legislation a response to the civil lawsuit stemming from the Indianapolis woman’s death. Plaintiffs in the case argue Uber was negligent in the hiring and training of Francisco Valadez, a former driver who was convicted of fatally shooting Dixon in 2024. He also confessed to attempting to rape the 30-year-old woman, court records show.

In a written statement to The Indiana Lawyer, an Uber spokesperson did say the inclusion of “vicarious liability reform” in the bill is a “direct response to the increasing use of ‘deep pocket’ litigation strategies that raise prices for Hoosiers and threaten Indiana’s economic stability.”

“HB 1417 helps address this systemic abuse and is a key part of the broader tort package focused on combating the ‘hidden tax’ of lawsuit abuse,” the spokesperson added.

Uber says vicarious liability has been “weaponized” by plaintiffs’ attorneys to hold corporations responsible for the actions of independent contractors.

Bob Johnson, president of the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association, called that reasoning “a stretch.”

“It’s just a little bit of, what I would call, trying to force a narrative, kind of that solution looking for a problem,” Johnson said. “…They don’t need immunity. Everything’s working fine the way it is.”

Uber has been under scrutiny for the sexual misconduct reports its riders have made in recent years.

More than 400,000 Uber trips resulted in reports of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in the U.S. from 2017 to 2022, The New York Times reported last year. Uber told The Times that no level of sexual assault is tolerable and has noted that a vast majority of those reports cited were “less serious” and “non-physical in nature” and did not fall into the category of sexual assault.

Dixon’s encounter with an Uber driver was deadly.

In September 2024, her naked body was found in the 1800 block of Wagner Lane with a gunshot wound to the head.

Last month, Valadez pleaded guilty to murdering her, as part of a plea deal resulting in a 45-year prison sentence.

Detectives said Valadez also admitted to trying to rape Dixon in the back of his car. And while he was attempting to assault her, Valadez said, Dixon insulted him and that caused him to go into a rage and shoot her, according to court records.

He told detectives that he then dragged Dixon out of his car and tried to have sex with her dead body.

Valadez was later arrested by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and initially charged with two counts of murder, attempted rape and attempted abuse of a corpse, according to arrest records.

Dixon’s estate is now involved in a civil action against Uber. That lawsuit was filed in May 2025 in Marion County Superior Court.

Uber attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing that Indiana’s transportation network statute establishes Valadez as an independent contractor, thereby exempting Uber from his actions.

The plaintiffs in the case disagreed with Uber’s interpretation of the law, arguing that there is “nothing” in the statute to create a blanket immunity for such companies.

“The statute regulates licensing, insurance, and disclosure obligations—it does not alter Indiana’s long-standing tort principles governing negligence, fraud, or product liability,” a response to the dismissal motion stated.

Marion County Superior Court Judge Gary Miller denied the dismissal, and the case is pending.

Attorneys interviewed by The Indiana Lawyer were divided over whether the legislation could potentially impact the civil lawsuit filed by Dixon’s estate.

Johnson said that if HB 1417 were to take effect before the civil case is wrapped up, it appears Uber would gain complete immunity from the plaintiff’s claims. The legislation, if approved as written, would take effect July 1.

Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, was less certain about the bill’s effect on pending lawsuits because it contains no retroactive clause. DeLaney opposes the bill, but he said if it is allowed to move forward, he would like to see a provision added that would explicitly allow existing lawsuits to proceed.

Terrance Kinnard, an attorney for Dixon’s estate, declined to comment on the legislation because the civil lawsuit is still ongoing.

Lehman, the bill’s author, did not respond to The Lawyer’s requests for comment.

For critics of the bill, any immunity, especially in Dixon’s case, removes accountability.

“Without accountability, it shifts all the harm that we know is going to happen from corporate actors back to the taxpayers,” Johnson said.

“Our citizens are the ones taking the risk, and shareholders of Uber and Lyft get all the reward,” he added. “I mean, this is to protect the platform and their profits, not the passengers.”

Johnson said his association is strongly opposing the legislation and is prepared to fight it.

Immunity for transportation network companies is just one component of a broader effort for tort reform this session.

The rest of the bill contains business protections that are a priority of the new Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, which includes the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Indiana Manufacturers Association, National Federation of Independent Business, Indiana Motor Truck Association and Indiana Bankers Association.

The measure would provide businesses with more protection from public nuisance claims and third-party criminal acts and places a $1 million cap on non-economic damages.

“The goal of all of these different provisions is to provide more certainty, more predictability to business owners,” Adam Berry, the chamber’s vice president of economic development and technology, said in an interview with The Lawyer last week.

Stephen Wolff, the alliance’s executive director, who also serves as the vice president of Corydon Group’s Governmental Affairs and Procurement division, echoed desires to create predictability for businesses.

“If Indiana were to become a place where it’s easy to bring people into these cases where they don’t necessarily have a nexus or a connection, it disincentivizes businesses from wanting to operate here,” Wolff said.

Berry said that over the last decade, he’s seen a tremendous increase in the cost of insurance premiums due to the rise in lawsuits.

By working to place caps on non-economic damages and protecting businesses from frivolous lawsuits, Berry said, HB 1417 would help “reduce the exposure that these businesses have.”

Berry said he is fairly confident the bill will receive a hearing from the House Judiciary Committee, but he expects there will be some refinement in the liability section of the bill before it moves along.

But Judiciary Committee Chair Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, expressed uncertainty about the bill’s future. He said it wouldn’t pass out of committee as it’s currently written.

“I’d like to see it pared down in some places,” he said, without specifying the changes he would like to see.

Alex Crisp is a freelance journalist focusing on environment, animal welfare, and new technology. He has a background in law, journalism, and teaching. He is the host of the “Future of Foods Interviews” podcast.

The “polluter pays” principle is a cornerstone of environmental regulation. It raises billions of dollars each year and has been fundamental in pushing energy companies to pursue cleaner, more cost-effective energy sources. But when it was first formalized in 1972 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), it faced resistance. Energy companies argued that internalizing environmental costs would damage competitiveness, raise consumer prices, and deter innovation. At the time, many in the energy sector warned that internalizing environmental costs would damage competitiveness, raise consumer prices, and lead to layoffs—arguments widely circulated in the media and industry forums. Despite this, the principle gradually moved from being labeled “radical” and “punitive” to becoming a foundation of environmental and economic law.

Today, we face a similar urgency for change. This time, it’s regarding our food systems.

The problem is agriculture. The very system that sustains us has become a driver of environmental breakdown. It consumes 70 percent of fresh water, occupies half of all habitable land, generates around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, and is the primary cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss. With the worldwide population expected to increase by 2 billion by mid century, demand for food is projected to rise by 50 percent, and protein demand alone is set to double by then, according to the 2017 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations report. So how can we produce more food without harming the planet, and where will the funds to support this transition come from?

The problem with food

Years of intensive agriculture mean that crops are being planted on exhausted fields; thus, in an ever-growing cycle of decay, farmers use more fertilizer to sustain yields. In his 2022 book Sixty Harvests Left, Philip Lymbery delivers an important message: that humanity’s food system is careening toward collapse. The title echoes a chilling United Nations warning that, under current industrial farming practices, 90 percent of the Earth’s topsoil is likely to be at risk by 2050.

Humanity consumes approximately 350 million tons of meat annually. That is equivalent to “nearly a thousand Empire State Buildings in carcass weight,” according to the book We Are Eating the Earth by Michael Grunwald. Livestock uses nearly 80 percent of agricultural land, yet provides less than 20 percent of global calories. They account for about 32 percent of global methane emissions, while beef production requires more than 15,000 liters of water per kilogram. The environmental cost of meat is disproportionately high. Global demand is rising, and protein production urgently needs innovation.

Intensifying floods, droughts, heat waves, collapsing fisheries, and accelerating species extinction are early signs of systemic stress. Agriculture is at the heart of this crisis. However, if approached differently, agriculture could also be a solution to the increasingly dire threat of climate disaster. The choices made in the coming years will shape not only our food security but also the planet’s resilience for generations to come.

Seven out of the nine planetary boundaries, as set by the Stockholm Resilience Center (SRC) in 2009, have now been breached. These boundaries were created to measure a “safe operating space for humanity.” The SRC states that, “Crossing boundaries increases the risk of generating large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.” Breaching these boundaries signals that humanity is pushing Earth’s life-support systems beyond safe limits. This is detrimental not only to all life on Earth but also to business, as supply chains, global markets, and economic stability all depend on a healthy and nurturing environment.

The proposed transition of the food system

As part of the Paris Agreement, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations launched the Food Roadmap at COP28. This was the first time any climate convention put food and agriculture on its agenda—aligning agriculture with climate goals. The roadmap called for a substantial scale-up of investment to develop and deploy low-emission farming methods, alternative proteins, and technologies that enhance soil health, improve water efficiency, and protect biodiversity.

The roadmap outlines 120 science-backed actions, clustered across 10 strategic domains, including soil and water, livestock, forests and wetlands, and healthy diets. The goal is to see food systems worldwide become carbon-neutral by 2035 and to achieve a net carbon sink by 2050. Livestock methane emissions would be reduced by 25 percent by 2030, and food waste would be halved.

The international community has been slow to react. However, by developing and implementing a widely accepted strategy and integrating meat-related levies into its climate initiative, Denmark has become a leading advocate in the transition. Its dual approach of plant-based incentives and emissions costs illustrates a progressive method for reducing meat dependency.

Marie-Louise Boisen Lendal, chair of the Danish fund Plant Foundation, which is overseeing a public investment of around $200 million in innovative solutions and the move toward plant-based foods, says, “Denmark is introducing the polluter pays principle because it is the most effective path to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.” She told me in a “Future of Foods Interview” podcast that Danish farmers are in favor of the idea. New Zealand and other countries, notably those in Scandinavia, exhibit similar signs of movement. The United Kingdom mooted a meat tax in 2024 as part of the National Food Strategy, but ultimately decided against it, citing public pushback.

Regenerative agriculture versus technology

By focusing on rebuilding soil health, increasing biodiversity, and enhancing water cycles, regenerative practices aim to sequester carbon, restore degraded ecosystems, and make food systems more resilient. However, critics argue that the impact of regenerative agriculture on carbon sequestration is overstated. Since these systems may yield less in the short term, more land is often required to produce the same amount of food, and the only available land to exploit is often forested.

Some also warn that the term “regenerative” risks becoming a vague marketing expression susceptible to greenwashing. Sajeev Mohankumar from the FAIRR Initiative—a sustainability investment network managing $80 trillion in assets—confirms that although many investors are prioritizing regenerative agriculture, its implementation remains limited. Mohankumar told “Future of Foods” that although 50 of 79 agri-food companies reference regenerative practices in their strategies, only four have provided financial incentives to farmers or producers.

Meanwhile, new agritech solutions are emerging as complementary approaches that could accelerate the transition when combined with regenerative techniques. Biofertilizers and biopesticides offer more sustainable options for soil health and could eventually replace current chemical inputs, though their effectiveness remains under evaluation.

Gene editing is already in use, producing crops that are resistant to disease, tolerant to drought, or enriched with nutrients—developments that could reduce reliance on pesticides despite political pushback. Precision fermentation is also advancing; this process utilizes microbes to produce dairy proteins, egg whites, and fats without using animals. Several products manufactured using this process have reached the market, though significant scaling up is needed to compete with conventional farming. Finally, cellular agriculture—also known as cultivated meat—continues to progress, with approvals already granted in Singapore, the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Yet here, too, the challenge of scaling remains substantial.

The cost of a food transition

The Food System Economics Commission (FSEC) estimates that implementing a comprehensive transformation of the food system would require annual investments of approximately $500 billion. In a Future of Foods Interview from October 2025, a representative from Cargill confirmed to me that they now invest around 10 percent of their annual profits into scaling alternative proteins. Conversations suggest that Nestlé invests a similar amount. Major food companies—including Nestlé, Cargill, Unilever, Tyson Foods, Danone, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, JBS, and Mars—are increasingly investing in or partnering with alternative protein ventures as part of their innovation and sustainability strategies, contributing to the broader sector’s multi‑billion‑dollar investment landscape in plant‑based, cultivated, and fermentation‑derived proteins.

The UN and the philanthropic sector pledged more than $7 billion for food and agriculture during COP28—including $200 million from the Gates-UAE initiative for innovation and $57 million from the Bezos Earth Fund for climate-smart agriculture. Additionally, a public-private SAFE Initiative in Africa and the Middle East has mobilized $10 billion. Global agricultural subsidies are estimated to be around $700 billion per year. The vast majority of this funding goes toward supporting the status quo, including intense and industrialized agriculture, which is often destined for animal feed or processed foods. Current government incentives primarily promote monocultures, industrial livestock production, and a heavy reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

The media and public perception

Few issues cut as close to home as food. Calls to curb meat consumption are growing louder, yet meat intake is climbing with rising incomes in emerging economies, coupled with entrenched habits in wealthier nations, pushing consumption higher. Resistance to reducing meat consumption runs deep. It isn’t just a meal—it’s culture. From Sunday roasts to steakhouse dinners and festive feasts worldwide, animal protein is tied to tradition and identity.

Plant-based alternatives can appear less satisfying and are often viewed with some suspicion. Confusion surrounding nutrition, combined with targeted disinformation campaigns, exacerbates this issue. In the UK, headlines in October 2024 in the Telegraph, such as “Lab-Grown Meat Is Proving to Be a Grotesque Misadventure,” captured skepticism toward the entire sector, citing high costs, technological hurdles, and public unease with labels like “Frankenmeat.” The Washington Post reported on health warnings tied to plant-based alternatives, highlighting scientific studies that grouped meat substitutes with other ultra-processed foods linked to heart disease, glossing over methodological nuances. For example, healthy plant-based foods should not be compared with a box of donuts.

The nonprofit Center for Consumer Freedom, funded by interests in the meat industry, launched full-page newspaper ads in 2020 that portrayed plant-based burgers as “ultra-processed imitations” or likened them to dog food. A similar campaign by the think tank, Center for the Environment and Welfare, compared cultured meat cells with “tumor” cells.

Proposals for meat taxes, climate-driven dietary shifts, or calls to reduce livestock farming are often framed by conservatives as attacks on tradition, national identity, and personal freedom. In Germany, farmers and political critics pushed back against proposed increases to meat taxes or VAT on meat, arguing such levies would burden consumers and harm livelihoods. In the Netherlands, discussions about a potential meat tax prompted political pushback, with government coalition parties and meat industry associations arguing that a levy could make grocery bills less affordable for ordinary consumers. In France, politicians have positioned steak and charcuterie as part of the cultural heritage, pushing back against calls for plant-based school meals. In the UK, media outlets such as the Telegraph have described proposals to reduce red meat consumption as an attack on the Sunday roast, tapping into working-class anxieties.

People still perceive meat as tastier, more convenient, and a more dependable source of protein than the alternatives available. Until substitutes can rival meat on these terms, the trend will likely continue upward.

A necessary change

The polluter pays principle is not a tax on consumers—it’s a tax on environmental damage, unnecessary harm to animals, and widespread deforestation. It’s a tax on corporations and manufacturers who have profited from the environment, earning billions.

Food systems should pay their actual ecological costs, as the era of subsidized industrial meat is winding down. By integrating this sector into the polluter-pays economy, we move from lip service to climate action, from compensation to transformation. Clean energy isn’t enough; clean food is next. “Much like the fossil fuel lobbyists who argue that the world can’t afford to do away with oil and gas if we want energy security, Big Ag lobbyists defend a current status quo that’s actively heating up the planet in the name of food security,” stated a 2023 Guardian article.",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25094635/food-day2-image.jpg?fit=1009%2C476&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-13 12:03:36.435303

The futures are trending higher after the December consumer price index came in at 2.7%, which matched Wall Street expectations. The reversal in the futures comes after a wild Monday that saw stocks get hammered on the open, amid news of Department of Justice subpoenas sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell regarding his testimony to Congress last summer. Initially, all the major indices plunged on the news, then reversed sharply to finish higher on the day. Both the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed up 0.17% at 49,590, and the S&P 500, which ended the day higher by 0.16% at 6,977, once again printed new all-time highs as the January strength continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last seen at 23,833, up 0.25%, and the Russel 2000 continued its red-hot start to the year, closing at 2,635, up 0.44%. The R2K is leading all the major indices in 2026, up 5.7% on the year. Wall Street is now looking forward to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings, with the big money-center banks reporting later this week.

Treasury Bonds:

Yields were higher across the entire Treasury curve on Monday, and you can bet that the controversy with the Federal Reserve receiving subpoenas was a big reason for the selling. The uncertainty about Fed independence and the potential for government intervention pushed bond prices down, echoing past “Sell America” events in 2025. The reality is this will likely blow over quickly, as a mountain of economic news and the start of earnings season will redirect attention. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%.

Oil and Gas:

Prices were higher across the energy complex on Monday as geopolitical tensions in multiple regions around the globe and the potential for long-term changes to the global oil supply drove crude oil prices higher, with the WTI and Brent benchmarks both climbing. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $64.01, up 1.06%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session at $59.63, up 0.85%. Natural gas stormed back after a wave of frigid weather swept across a large swath of the U.S. Monday, closing up 6.5% at $3.38.

Gold:

In what seems like a never-ending story, Gold closed Monday at $4,596, up another 1.94%. Wall Street’s $5,000 price targets for the precious metal could arrive much sooner than expected. The combination of numerous geopolitical hotspots and Federal Reserve news once again provided the stiff tailwind that has been present for well over a year. Silver also bolted higher on Monday, climbing a massive 6.6% to close trading at $85.14. Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher.

Crypto:

The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131.

JNJ Price Action: Johnson & Johnson shares were up 0.46% at $210.68 at the time of publication on Tuesday.","Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Monday reportedly secured a partial legal victory after Delaware's highest court overturned a portion of a $1 billion damages award tied to its acquisition of surgical robotics company Auris Health.

In a unanimous ruling issued Monday, Reuters reported that the Delaware Supreme Court set aside part of a September 2024 judgment that had favored former Auris shareholders.

In 2019, Johnson & Johnson acquired Auris Health for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones.

What Happened

The lawsuit filed in 2024 claimed that Johnson & Johnson was struggling to develop its own surgical robot, Verb, despite significant investment.

With Verb behind schedule and surgical robotics strategically critical, Johnson & Johnson viewed Auris as a solution.

Auris agreed after securing Johnson & Johnson's commitment to apply commercially reasonable efforts consistent with a ""priority medical device.""

Following the acquisition, Johnson & Johnson failed to honor that commitment. Instead of supporting Auris' iPlatform's regulatory progress, Johnson & Johnson forced it into direct competition with Verb under ""Project Manhattan."" This halted regulatory momentum and diverted engineering resources. Although iPlatform ultimately outperformed Verb, Johnson & Johnson merged the two programs, effectively subordinating iPlatform to salvage its Verb investment.

Auris's former shareholders sued for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud.

In 2024, the court found that Johnson & Johnson breached its obligations by failing to prioritize iPlatform, undermining the regulatory milestones, and acting to avoid the earnout. Johnson & Johnson also breached the implied covenant by failing to support a revised regulatory pathway. Separately, Johnson & Johnson was found to have committed fraud by failing to disclose a regulatory investigation tied to a Monarch milestone it had represented as virtually guaranteed.

Damages, including interest, exceed $1 billion, compensating Auris's former shareholders for lost earnout payments.

Why It Matters

Reuters noted that Justice Abigail LeGrow rejected a key finding made by the Chancery Court. She ruled that the lower court erred in concluding Johnson & Johnson had an implied obligation to secure regulatory approval by the end of 2021 for an iPlatform product related to abdominal procedures.

The Supreme Court said the language of the merger agreement did not support that requirement.

Despite that reversal, the justices upheld most of the findings issued by Vice Chancellor Lori Will, leaving intact conclusions that Johnson & Johnson failed to meet other contractual obligations.

The case was remanded to Will to reassess damages in light of the ruling.

What's Next

Johnson & Johnson said it is reviewing its options following the decision.

The court's decision on Monday sends the case back to the Delaware Chancery Court for a recalculation of damages. As a result, the total award, including interest, could decline by a couple of hundred million dollars.

In December 2025, a Baltimore jury ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries to pay over $1.5 billion to a woman who claimed that decades of exposure to asbestos in the company's talc-based products caused her peritoneal mesothelioma, a form of cancer.

JNJ Price Action: Johnson & Johnson shares were up 0.46% at $210.68 at the time of publication on Tuesday. The stock is approaching its 52-week high of $215.18, according to Benzinga Pro data.

U.S. Bancorp and BTIG have worked closely over the past decade. Since 2014, BTIG has been the company’s equity capital markets referral partner. In 2023, the two began an M&A advisory referral program. The partnership has resulted in many U.S. Bancorp clients experiencing the high-touch service and excellent execution for which BTIG is known.

“BTIG is a world-class firm with talented professionals who align with our unshakable commitment to lasting success and growth for clients,” said Philipson. “BTIG’s addition to U.S. Bancorp is a strategic move to fill key product gaps for our corporate and institutional clients, enabling us to offer a more comprehensive suite of capital markets services. At the same time, BTIG clients will gain access to U.S. Bancorp’s robust financial platform and extensive product set, including investment services, asset management, wealth management and payments.”

“Today marks an exciting new chapter for BTIG,” said Starker. “Joining forces with U.S. Bancorp will allow us to accelerate our growth and further enhance client service. We are energized by the shared vision between our organizations and confident that our combined capabilities will deliver significant value and drive future success.”

Walk into a hotel, a food processing plant, a pharmaceutical lab, or a data center, and chances are you’re walking through Ecolab Inc.’s real product: an invisible mesh of water, hygiene, and energy systems quietly keeping everything clean, compliant, and increasingly, low-carbon.

Ecolab Inc. is often described as a chemical or cleaning company, but that framing is now badly outdated. The company has spent the last decade rebuilding itself as a sustainability and operations technology platform: dosing chemicals with milliliter precision, monitoring water flows in real time, and optimizing industrial boilers with machine learning. The value proposition is clear and brutally pragmatic: use less water, less heat, less chemistry – while keeping higher standards of hygiene, safety, and uptime.

What makes Ecolab Inc. so relevant right now is the convergence of three pressures on its customers: regulatory emissions targets, volatile energy and water costs, and tighter hygiene expectations from consumers and authorities. That’s creating a premium on technologies that can cut resource use without requiring a full rip-and-replace of existing infrastructure. This is where Ecolab Inc. has turned its traditional field-services business into a data-rich sustainability engine.

Get all details on Ecolab Inc. here

Inside the Flagship: Ecolab Inc.

Ecolab Inc. does not have a single consumer-facing flagship product like an iPhone or a Tesla Model Y. Its flagship is an integrated portfolio that blends chemistry, hardware, and software across water treatment, cleaning & sanitation, and infection prevention. What unifies these lines is a simple promise: measurable savings and risk reduction for complex, high-stakes operations.

At the center of that promise are several core platforms that illustrate what Ecolab Inc. has become.

Digital Control: The ECOLAB3D and Nalco Water digital platforms

Ecolab’s most transformative product shift is its move into industrial IoT and analytics. The company’s Nalco Water unit and the broader ECOLAB3D platform act as always-on monitoring and optimization layers for water and energy systems.

Real-time sensing: Sensors embedded in boilers, cooling towers, and process water lines continuously track flow rates, temperatures, water quality, and chemical dosing levels.

Cloud analytics: Data streams into ECOLAB3D, which applies analytics and increasingly AI-driven pattern recognition to flag inefficiencies, leaks, scaling risks, microbial growth, or non-compliance.

Actionable insights: Instead of just selling chemical formulas, Ecolab Inc. delivers dashboards and alerts that translate into hard metrics: cubic meters of water saved, therms of gas avoided, tons of CO? emissions reduced.

The result is that Ecolab Inc. looks less like an industrial supplier and more like a subscription-based performance partner. For large manufacturing sites, food and beverage plants, and heavy industry, the difference between reactive maintenance and data-guided optimization can mean millions in avoided downtime and utility costs.

Water Management as a Strategic Product

One of Ecolab Inc.’s most strategically important product domains is water. As water stress intensifies globally, companies are being pushed not just to consume less, but to prove they are doing so.

Ecolab’s Nalco Water portfolio includes:

Water reuse and recycling systems that allow plants to reclaim and safely reuse process water instead of relying solely on fresh intake.

Cooling and boiler water treatment programs that reduce scaling and corrosion, enabling lower blowdown rates and higher efficiency.

Digital water intelligence modules inside ECOLAB3D that model plant-wide water balance, identify high?leakage zones, and benchmark performance against best practices.

The company positions water not merely as a cost line, but as a core ESG performance indicator. For global brands that publish annual sustainability reports, Ecolab Inc. offers something rare: auditable, meter-level data that links specific process changes to specific water savings. That makes it a behind-the-scenes enabler of public climate commitments and investor-grade ESG metrics.

Food Safety, Hygiene, and Infection Prevention

Another pillar of Ecolab Inc.’s offering is hygiene and infection prevention in hospitality, healthcare, food service, and manufacturing. In this arena, Ecolab’s products are less glamorous but no less critical: surface disinfectants, warewashing systems, laundry solutions, hand hygiene programs, and clean-in-place (CIP) systems for industrial equipment.

What’s changed is the digital layer and integration:

Connected dispensers and dosing systems ensure that cleaning agents are mixed at precisely the right concentrations – boosting performance while cutting waste.

Compliance reporting tools generate auditable logs of cleaning cycles, temperatures, and contact times, critical for regulated environments like food processing and hospitals.

End-to-end program design wraps chemistry in training, on-site consulting, and digital documentation, turning what used to be a commodity product into a high-stickiness service.

For hotels and restaurants, this means more consistent hygiene standards and lower product usage per wash or per room. For hospitals and labs, it can mean fewer hospital-acquired infections and better infection control compliance – metrics that carry serious financial and reputational weight.

Energy and Emissions: Decarbonization as a Feature, Not a Slogan

Ecolab Inc. increasingly positions its products as emissions-reduction tools. By optimizing water systems and cleaning processes, the company can directly reduce customers’ fuel and electricity use. For instance:

Tuning boiler chemistry and blowdown can improve fuel efficiency.

Better heat-exchanger cleanliness reduces the energy needed to achieve target temperatures.

Water reuse cuts the energy required for pumping, heating, and treatment.

The company quantifies these impacts in terms of carbon, embedding sustainability outcomes into its core sales narrative. This is critical for sectors under pressure to decarbonize operations – from food and beverage to data centers – but reluctant to overhaul physical infrastructure. Ecolab Inc. offers a relatively low-friction route to measurable emissions cuts.

Market Rivals: Ecolab Inc. Aktie vs. The Competition

Ecolab Inc. operates in a sprawling competitive landscape that spans industrial chemicals, specialty materials, digital water platforms, and hygiene solutions. Its closest rivals attack different parts of its portfolio, but few match its fully integrated chemistry-plus-digital-plus-service model.

Diversey – Competing on Hygiene and Institutional Cleaning

On the hygiene and institutional cleaning front, Diversey is a prominent direct competitor. Products such as Diversey Suma for kitchen hygiene and Diversey Oxivir disinfectant lines compete head-to-head with Ecolab Inc.’s food service, hospitality, and healthcare offerings.

Compared directly to Diversey Suma and related cleaning systems, Ecolab Inc. leans more heavily into end-to-end program integration and on-site service density. Ecolab field teams are embedded at many large customer sites, offering continuous optimization and staff training rather than periodic check-ins. Diversey’s strength lies in its agile innovation pipeline and targeted hygiene chemistries, but it has historically had less scale on the analytics and deep industrial water side where Ecolab Inc. is strongest.

Solenis – Rivals in Water and Process Treatment

In industrial water and process treatment, Solenis is one of Ecolab Inc.’s most relevant challengers. Its products such as Solenis OnGuard monitoring systems and specialty chemicals for pulp & paper, power, and chemical processing directly compete with Ecolab’s Nalco Water solutions.

Compared directly to Solenis OnGuard technologies, Ecolab Inc.’s edge is its broad, cross-industry footprint and the scale of its digital platform. Solenis offers deep technical strength in specific verticals, particularly pulp and paper, while Ecolab’s portfolio reaches from beverage bottling and mining to microelectronics cooling and data center water reuse. Ecolab Inc.’s ECOLAB3D architecture is designed to aggregate insights across sectors, allowing it to standardize best practices and benchmark performance across a global client base.

Veolia and the Water-Tech Giants

Zooming out, utilities and infrastructure companies like Veolia also compete for the water-technology budget. Veolia’s digital products, such as its Hubgrade performance monitoring platform, aim to optimize water and wastewater systems for municipalities and industry.

Compared directly to Veolia Hubgrade, Ecolab Inc. generally plays closer to the process level inside factories, plants, and buildings rather than at the municipal-network scale. Veolia is often engaged when a customer is outsourcing water infrastructure entirely, while Ecolab is embedded inside the customer’s own operations teams, tweaking chemistry and systems in line with production goals and safety standards.

Where Competitors Hit Hard – and Where They Fall Short

Rivals bring their own strengths:

Diversey can be more aggressive on price in specific hygiene categories, especially in markets where Ecolab’s service density is lower.

Solenis has strong specialization in particular industries, making it a formidable alternative for customers who prioritize niche technical depth over broad portfolio integration.

Veolia can bundle water-tech with large-scale infrastructure projects, offering an end-to-end solution that sits outside the typical remit of Ecolab’s service teams.

But none of these competitors fully replicate Ecolab Inc.’s core strategic play: high-touch field service tied directly to measurable sustainability metrics, all layered over a rapidly growing data and analytics stack. That combination is what turns everyday cleaning and water treatment into a long-term, sticky relationship rather than a recurring tender for lowest-cost chemistry.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Ecolab Inc.’s advantage is not one single blockbuster product, but a set of reinforcing moats built over decades and upgraded for a sustainability-first era.

1. Service-Led, Data-Backed Model

Ecolab Inc. employs thousands of field service specialists who operate on-site at customer locations worldwide. Historically, that meant inspecting boilers, troubleshooting dishwashers, or recalibrating dosing pumps. Today, those same teams are armed with dashboards from ECOLAB3D, predictive maintenance alerts, and quantified sustainability metrics.

This hybrid of service and software is hard to copy. Competitors can emulate parts of it – a good formula here, a smart sensor there – but replicating the global, always-on field presence and the integrated data stack is capital intensive and time consuming. Customers increasingly see Ecolab Inc. not just as a supplier, but as a quasi-outsourced operations partner.

2. Sustainability as a Business Outcome, Not a Marketing Add-On

Where many industrial players talk about sustainability in terms of marketing narratives, Ecolab Inc. has embedded it in contract-level outcomes. Proposals are framed in cubic meters of water saved, kilowatt-hours of energy avoided, and tons of CO? emissions reduced – all tied to the customer’s publicly stated ESG goals.

For global brands under scrutiny from regulators, investors, and consumers, this is compelling. Ecolab’s tools help turn high-level net-zero pledges into specific, trackable projects: retrofitting cooling towers to save water, optimizing CIP systems to cut hot-water usage, or reducing chemical over-dosing that leads to additional wastewater loads.

3. Portfolio Breadth Across Critical Sectors

Ecolab Inc. touches a long list of sectors that cannot afford failure: hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturing, food processing, large-scale catering, hotels, mining, power, and the fast-growing data center segment. This diversification gives Ecolab resilience against downturns in any one vertical, and cross-pollination of ideas from one industry to another.

It also strengthens the business case for its digital platforms. When ECOLAB3D implements a new optimization strategy for cooling systems in a beverage plant, those learnings can be quickly applied to similar cooling challenges in data centers or electronics manufacturing. The more customers deploy the platform, the smarter and more valuable it becomes.

4. Incremental, Not Disruptive

Unlike pure-play climate-tech startups that often depend on customers making big, risky capital investments, Ecolab Inc. usually sells incremental improvements layered onto existing assets: better boiler chemistry, a smarter water treatment program, more efficient cleaning protocols. The payback periods are typically short, making CFOs more comfortable.

This incrementalism is a hidden advantage. It aligns with how industrial and hospitality operators actually upgrade: step by step, avoiding downtime and preserving existing equipment. Ecolab sits perfectly in that pattern, making decarbonization and water conservation feel manageable rather than disruptive.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

To understand how this product strategy flows into shareholder value, you have to look at the performance of Ecolab Inc. Aktie (ISIN US2824031014).

Using live market data from major financial platforms, Ecolab Inc.’s stock most recently traded at a price in the low-to-mid $220 range per share, with a market capitalization in the tens of billions of dollars. As of the latest available market session, the stock is trading closer to its 52?week highs than its lows, reflecting sustained investor confidence. The pricing and performance figures are cross?checked from multiple real?time sources, and the timestamp for this data is aligned with the latest trading session on U.S. markets; when markets are closed, these figures represent the last official closing price rather than intraday moves.

What matters more than the precise tick-by-tick movement is why investors are rewarding Ecolab Inc. Aktie. A few themes stand out:

Resilient, recurring revenue: Much of Ecolab’s business is built on ongoing service contracts and consumable products. Once embedded, customers are reluctant to switch due to the operational risk of changing water or hygiene partners.

Sustainability tailwinds: As more companies set science-based targets for emissions and water use, demand grows for exactly the kinds of optimization programs Ecolab Inc. sells. That positions the stock as a structural, not cyclical, growth story.

Digital expansion: The market increasingly values Ecolab’s digital platforms as potential margin enhancers and growth multipliers. Software-like economics layered onto an already sticky services base is a powerful narrative.

Investors are effectively betting that Ecolab Inc.’s integrated product strategy – chemistry plus IoT plus analytics plus field service – will keep translating into margin expansion and steady top-line growth. Each new deployment of Nalco Water digital monitoring or ECOLAB3D analytics increases switching costs for customers and deepens the company’s data moat.

There are risks, of course. Intense competition in hygiene and industrial chemicals keeps pricing pressure alive, and economic slowdowns can hit discretionary capital spending at customer sites. Regulatory shifts could also change how customers account for water and emissions savings, affecting how quickly projects are approved. But overall, the direction of travel is favorable: more regulation, more ESG scrutiny, and more need for proven, measurable sustainability solutions.

In that context, Ecolab Inc. Aktie is less a simple industrial stock and more a proxy for the industrialization of sustainability. The better its core products help companies save water, cut emissions, and stay compliant, the more embedded – and valuable – Ecolab becomes.

The Bottom Line

Ecolab Inc. is an archetype of a 20th-century industrial supplier that has quietly evolved into a 21st-century sustainability and data platform. Its flagship is not a single device or app, but a web of technologies and services that sit inside some of the world’s most critical and water-intensive operations.

In a market where climate and resource constraints are no longer abstractions but line items on the balance sheet, that positioning gives Ecolab Inc. both operational relevance and strategic leverage. Competitors can challenge it on price or niche domains, but few can match the breadth of its portfolio or the depth of its field-service and data infrastructure.

For customers, that means a partner capable of turning sustainability goals into concrete, plant-level actions. For investors, it means a company whose product strength and recurring-revenue engine are increasingly aligned with the biggest structural trend in global industry: doing more with less water, less energy, and less risk.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405021_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:01:14.722435

Even if that's the case, there is a compelling case to be made for Novo Nordisk. Beyond oral Wegovy, it has earned other label expansions in recent months and is racing toward the approval of its next-gen anti-obesity medicine, CagriSema. The Denmark-based pharmaceutical giant also has other important mid- and late-stage candidates that are expected to make progress in the coming years.

The air carrier also announced a new agreement with Boeing (BA), increasing its order number with the jet maker.

Delta Air Lines reported Q4 EPS falling 16% to $1.55 with revenue increasing 1.2% to $14.61 billion. FactSet consensus expected earnings of $1.53 per share with sales of $14.68 billion.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in the earnings release that ""2026 is off to a strong start with top-line growth accelerating on consumer and corporate demand.""

For Q1 2026, Delta sees revenue growing between 5% and 7% with operating margin 4.5% to 6%. The air carrier expects Q1 earnings of 50 cents to 90 cents per share, while analysts predict 72 cents per share. The low end of Delta's guidance would represent 8.7% growth vs. Q1 2025.

""Since the start of this year, cash sales trends have accelerated on top of last year's strong performance, with momentum across the booking curve and all geographies,"" Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president, said in the earnings release Tuesday.

The air carrier also announced Tuesday it had reached an agreement with Boeing to purchase 30 787-10 aircraft, with options to buy an additional 30. Delta said deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to begin in 2031. The company added it has also entered into an agreement with engine manufacturer GE Aerospace (GE) to service the GEnx engines selected for the aircraft.

NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Mantra Health, the digital mental health provider built exclusively to support student well-being and success across higher education, today announced the launch of Beacon, the first early alert and intelligence platform designed to improve student mental health, well-being, persistence, and success, which ultimately contributes to institutional retention efforts. The Jed Foundation (JED)*, a leading nonprofit that protects emotional health and prevents suicide for our nation's teens and young adults, will strategically advise on the implementation of Beacon.

Developed after 18 months of research and application, the persistence intelligence platform gives higher education institutions the clarity needed to proactively identify students at risk of dropout and make more strategic, data-informed investments in long-term retention initiatives across different populations. Named after the unwavering light guiding weary travelers to shore, Beacon offers a clear, steady path to support and care for students facing complex challenges and gives institutions the insights needed to make strategic investments.

The platform includes a semi-annual student well-being assessment administered to cohorts of students pre-determined by the participating institution, such as first-year students, graduate students, or the entire student body. Unlike traditional screening solutions that can take several months to return actionable insights, Beacon combines data from holistic student wellness assessments with institutional data to provide university leadership and staff with a dynamic, real-time view of student needs at the individual level and across populations.

""To make a significant impact on college student mental health, we encourage institutions to strategically transition from a reactive safety net to a more comprehensive and proactive system of preventative support,"" said Dr. Tony Walker, Senior Vice President of School Programs and Consulting at JED. ""Early detection and connection to resources like screening tools are critical to promote emotional and mental health and prevent suicide among young people.""

JED brings significant experience to its strategic advisory role on Beacon's implementation, including 25 years of work with over 550 colleges, 150 high schools, and 28 school districts representing over 670 schools. Through JED's proven technical-assistance programs and evidence-informed strategies, more than seven million students nationwide have been reached.

""Building an infrastructure for actionable risk identification is extremely challenging and very few institutions have the resources to build the real-time tools needed to make data-informed decisions. Beacon provides the opportunity to act proactively,"" says Matt Kennedy, CEO and Co-founder of Mantra Health. ""Once implemented, it will help institutions reach a far greater percentage of their student body, retain students at risk of stopping out, make more targeted institutional changes to improve student well-being, and create more efficient ways of connecting students to personalized care.""

While the launch of Beacon is a robust early alert and intelligence platform today, it signals the next phase of Mantra Health's vision for advancing student well-being and persistence. Mantra Health will continue to expand Beacon's predictive analytics and AI capabilities to help institutions move beyond identification to automated intervention modeling. By leveraging AI to synthesize students' needs with institutional resources, the platform will help leaders forecast which interventions will yield the highest measurable impact on student well-being and retention.

Beacon has already shown significant potential to drive meaningful change. An October 2025 launch at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), for instance, which focused on first-time, full-year students, achieved a nearly 39% completion rate and surfaced a critical group of students at higher risk of dropout. This led NJIT to make strategic decisions, including launching a six-part workshop series for around their high-risk areas, as well as conducting personalized outreach to students at risk of stopping out.

""With Beacon, the institution demonstrates care by directly giving students the opportunity to express where they have concerns with persistence and success. Beacon also provides assurance that students who report concerns impacting their ability to persist are, at bare minimum, receiving personalized resources,"" said Sean Dowd, MSW, Senior Associate Dean of Students at NJIT.

For institutions across the country, Beacon brings a new paradigm in supporting their student's well-being proactively rather than reactively. This ultimately increases their student body's persistence through to graduation and retains much-needed tuition revenue.

In October, J&J announced its intention to separate its Orthopaedics franchise into a standalone orthopedics-focused company called DePuy Synthes.
The separation should also improve its MedTech unit’s growth and margins as the Orthopaedics franchise has been a slow-growth business for J&J.
J&J expects to launch new products like Shockwave C2 Aero catheter and Tecnis intraocular lens in the United States in 2026.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research J&J has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.","Johnson & Johnson's JNJ medical devices segment, known as MedTech, offers products in the orthopedics, surgery, cardiovascular and vision markets. The MedTech segment accounts for around 36% of J&J’s total revenues.

In the MedTech segment, though issues in Asia Pacific markets, specifically China, are hurting sales, J&J is successfully shifting its portfolio to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the acquisitions of Shockwave in 2024 and Abiomed in 2022, J&J has become a category leader in four of the largest and highest-growth cardiovascular intervention MedTech markets.

Sales in J&J’s MedTech business have improved in the past two quarters, driven by the acquired cardiovascular businesses, Abiomed and Shockwave, as well as Surgical Vision and wound closure in Surgery. Improvements in J&J’s electrophysiology business also drove the growth.

The MedTech segment is expected to continue seeing strong momentum in Cardiovascular, Surgery and Vision in the fourth quarter, backed by increased adoption of newly launched products.

However, the company continues to face headwinds in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program, which is a government-driven cost containment effort in China. Sales in China are likely to have been hurt by the impact of the VBP program in the fourth quarter.

In October, J&J announced its intention to separate its Orthopaedics franchise into a standalone orthopedics-focused company called DePuy Synthes.

The decision aligns with J&J’s efforts to shift its MedTech portfolio to high-innovation, high-growth markets like cardiovascular and robotic surgery. The separation should also improve its MedTech unit’s growth and margins as the Orthopaedics franchise has been a slow-growth business for J&J. An update on the progress of the Orthopaedics franchise spin-off is expected on the fourth-quarter conference call.

On the conference call, investors will also look for updates on the MedTech unit’s outlook for 2026. Earlier, J&J had said that in 2026, it expects better growth in the MedTech business than 2025 levels, driven by increased adoption of newly launched products across all MedTech platforms and increased focus on higher-growth markets. J&J expects to launch new products like Shockwave C2 Aero catheter and Tecnis intraocular lens in the United States in 2026. It also filed a regulatory submission for the OTTAVA robotic surgical system earlier this month. These new products may also contribute to growth in 2026.

Our estimates for the MedTech unit suggest a CAGR of around 5.4% over the next three years.

J&J’s Key Competitors in the Medical Devices Market

J&J’s MedTech unit faces strong competition from several major players in the medical device industry, like Medtronic MDT, Abbott, Stryker SYK and Boston Scientific BSX.

While Medtronic has a strong presence in cardiovascular, neuroscience and surgical technologies, Stryker is a global leader in medical technology, specializing in innovative solutions across surgical, neurotechnology, orthopedics and spine care. Boston Scientific markets products for cardiovascular, endoscopy, urology and neuromodulation. Abbott is known for its medical device products across cardiovascular, diagnostics and diabetes care.

The separation should also improve its MedTech unit’s growth and margins as the Orthopaedics franchise has been a slow-growth business for J&J.

The MedTech segment accounts for around 36% of J&J’s total revenues.

In the MedTech segment, though issues in Asia Pacific markets, specifically China, are hurting sales, J&J is successfully shifting its portfolio to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the acquisitions of Shockwave in 2024 and Abiomed in 2022, J&J has become a category leader in four of the largest and highest-growth cardiovascular intervention MedTech markets.

Sales in J&J’s MedTech business have improved in the past two quarters, driven by the acquired cardiovascular businesses, Abiomed and Shockwave, as well as Surgical Vision and wound closure in Surgery. Improvements in J&J’s electrophysiology business also drove the growth.

The MedTech segment is expected to continue seeing strong momentum in Cardiovascular, Surgery and Vision in the fourth quarter, backed by increased adoption of newly launched products.

However, the company continues to face headwinds in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program, which is a government-driven cost containment effort in China. Sales in China are likely to have been hurt by the impact of the VBP program in the fourth quarter.

In October, J&J announced its intention to separate its Orthopaedics franchise into a standalone orthopedics-focused company called DePuy Synthes.

The decision aligns with J&J’s efforts to shift its MedTech portfolio to high-innovation, high-growth markets like cardiovascular and robotic surgery. The separation should also improve its MedTech unit’s growth and margins as the Orthopaedics franchise has been a slow-growth business for J&J. An update on the progress of the Orthopaedics franchise spin-off is expected on the fourth-quarter conference call.

On the conference call, investors will also look for updates on the MedTech unit’s outlook for 2026. Earlier, J&J had said that in 2026, it expects better growth in the MedTech business than 2025 levels, driven by increased adoption of newly launched products across all MedTech platforms and increased focus on higher-growth markets. J&J expects to launch new products like Shockwave C2 Aero catheter and Tecnis intraocular lens in the United States in 2026. It also filed a regulatory submission for the OTTAVA robotic surgical system earlier this month. These new products may also contribute to growth in 2026.

Our estimates for the MedTech unit suggest a CAGR of around 5.4% over the next three years.

J&J’s Key Competitors in the Medical Devices Market

J&J’s MedTech unit faces strong competition from several major players in the medical device industry, like Medtronic MDT, Abbott, Stryker SYK and Boston Scientific BSX.

While Medtronic has a strong presence in cardiovascular, neuroscience and surgical technologies, Stryker is a global leader in medical technology, specializing in innovative solutions across surgical, neurotechnology, orthopedics and spine care. Boston Scientific markets products for cardiovascular, endoscopy, urology and neuromodulation. Abbott is known for its medical device products across cardiovascular, diagnostics and diabetes care.

Latest purchase brings Delta's order book to 130 Boeing airplanes as it builds future fleet

Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Delta Air Lines today announced the U.S. carrier placed its first direct order for up to 60 787 Dreamliners to support long-haul international growth and renew the airline's widebody fleet. Delta's purchase of 30 787-10 jets with opportunity for up to 30 more of the largest 787 variant will enable the airline's expansion and modernization plans on high-demand transatlantic and South American routes.

""Delta is building the fleet for the future, enhancing the customer experience, driving operational improvements and providing steady replacements for less efficient, older aircraft in the decade to come,"" said Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer. ""Most importantly, these aircraft will be operated by the best aviation professionals in the industry, providing Delta's welcoming, elevated and caring service to travelers worldwide.""

With capacity for up to 336 passengers and 25% lower fuel use than the airplanes it replaces, the 787-10 offers the lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody airplane. Delivering superior comfort for passengers, the 787 Dreamliner features the largest windows of any widebody airplane flying today and air that is pressurized at a lower cabin altitude, which will help Delta's customers arrive at their destinations feeling more refreshed.

""We are excited that Delta Air Lines has selected the 787-10 to join its fleet of the future. The 787 Dreamliner's unmatched efficiency, range, and passenger comfort make it a perfect fit for Delta's international expansion and fleet modernization,"" said Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. ""Our team looks forward to delivering new Dreamliners to Delta and supporting their commitments to provide an exceptional passenger experience and advance sustainability in aviation.""

Following what is expected to be an exceptionally strong 2025, Bank of America forecasts a somewhat more moderate performance for 2026.","Market sentiment toward IBM continues to improve. As the technology giant prepares to release its quarterly figures, it has received another vote of confidence from Wall Street, with Bank of America issuing a positive update. However, alongside raising its price target, the firm's analysts have cautioned about near-term pressure on profit margins and slightly tempered expectations for the coming year.

The latest show of support came from BofA Securities, which on Tuesday morning reaffirmed its ""Buy"" rating for IBM shares while lifting its price objective from $315 to $335. This move aligns with the optimistic stance taken by Jefferies earlier in January. On January 6, Jefferies upgraded the stock and set a price target of $360, emphasizing the company's potential in cloud computing and its Red Hat division. Bank of America's confidence, in contrast, is primarily anchored to IBM's robust cash flow generation.

The stock has responded favorably to this analyst activity. It is currently trading near its 52-week high of $312.18 and has advanced more than 7% since the start of the year.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Long-Term Drivers: Software and Strategic Acquisitions

Despite some near-term cautions, the long-term outlook from analysts remains positive. The high-margin software business is seen as a key growth engine. Furthermore, the impending integration of the $11 billion acquisition of Confluent is viewed as a strategic positive that supports the buy recommendation. Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, Bank of America projects that IBM will generate approximately $15 billion in free cash flow, a figure that underscores the investment case for the equity.

Margin Pressures Loom as a Near-Term Challenge

The analysis is not without its caveats. Experts anticipate that the upcoming quarterly report will be impacted by an estimated $400 million in workforce restructuring charges. This expense is likely to cause IBM to fall just short of its own margin expansion target for fiscal 2025. Following what is expected to be an exceptionally strong 2025, Bank of America forecasts a somewhat more moderate performance for 2026.

All eyes are now on January 28. When IBM discloses its results for the fourth quarter of 2025, the critical focus for investors will be whether management's guidance for 2026 confirms the anticipated growth within the software segment.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2430353_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:15:22.461053

Earnings Snapshot: A Beat and a Miss The company's reported figures for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, show a clear divergence between profit and revenue performance relative to Wall Street forecasts.
Revenue (Sales): Reported at $5.18 billion, coming in below the estimated $5.29 billion.
This initial dip suggests investors are weighing the earnings beat against the revenue miss and any forward-looking commentary from management.
This aligns with the earnings beat and points to strength in BNY Mellon's core servicing and treasury activities.","BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP (NYSE:BK) reported its fourth-quarter 2025 financial results, delivering a performance that presented a mixed picture for investors. The global financial services company beat expectations on the bottom line but fell short on the top line, a dynamic that appears to be reflected in the stock's initial market reaction.

Earnings Snapshot: A Beat and a Miss

The company's reported figures for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, show a clear divergence between profit and revenue performance relative to Wall Street forecasts.

Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP): Reported at $2.08, surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $2.04.

Revenue (Sales): Reported at $5.18 billion, coming in below the estimated $5.29 billion.

This pattern of higher profitability on slightly lower revenue suggests effective cost management and potentially stronger performance in higher-margin business segments, even as overall revenue generation faced headwinds or timing differences.

Market Reaction and Recent Performance

The immediate market response to the earnings release appears cautious. In pre-market trading following the report, the stock is indicated lower, with a decline of approximately 0.6%. This initial dip suggests investors are weighing the earnings beat against the revenue miss and any forward-looking commentary from management.

Looking at a broader timeframe, the stock's performance has been relatively muted:

Over the past week, shares are essentially flat.

Over the past month, the stock has posted a modest gain of about 1.7%.

This indicates that the market had not priced in a significant positive surprise ahead of the report, and the mixed results are now being digested.

Press Release Summary and Forward Outlook

According to the company's press release, the fourth-quarter profit was driven by gains in fee revenue and interest income. This aligns with the earnings beat and points to strength in BNY Mellon's core servicing and treasury activities. The company has also declared its regular quarterly dividend, a sign of continued commitment to shareholder returns.

While the press release itself does not provide a specific quantitative financial outlook from management, analyst estimates for the coming periods offer a benchmark for future performance. Analysts are currently forecasting for BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP:

Q1 2026 Revenue: Approximately $5.23 billion

Q1 2026 EPS: Approximately $1.87

Full-Year 2026 Revenue: Approximately $21.47 billion

Full-Year 2026 EPS: Approximately $8.40

Investors will likely focus on the upcoming conference call for management's commentary on the revenue trajectory, net interest income expectations, and fee growth trends for 2026 to assess if the company is positioned to meet or exceed these estimates.

Conclusion

BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP's fourth-quarter results underscore the complex environment for global custodial and asset-servicing banks. The ability to expand profitability in the face of a revenue shortfall demonstrates operational discipline. However, the market's initial tepid reaction highlights the importance investors place on top-line growth as an indicator of underlying business momentum and market share. The path of interest rates and equity market levels in 2026 will be critical drivers for both the company's fee-based and interest-sensitive revenues.

And it’s the backbone of the retail media boom of the past few years.
Is it possible that the explosion in conversational, AI-driven search could provide Google a do-over in retail media?
A few things to consider: We don’t quite know yet how retail media ads will work in AI searches, if at all.
From Google’s point of view - maybe retailers were never going to let the company power their fledgling retail media businesses a few years back.","Advertisers are predicted to spend $71.09 billion on retail media in 2026 - eclipsing the TV ad market in the US, per eMarketer.

After all those years chasing TV budgets, it has to irk the folks at Google just a tad that the company completely whiffed on an ad market that should have been a layup for the Silicon Valley titan.

After all - text ads that pop up when people are making very specific searches - often with high intent - is kind of Google’s thing. And it’s the backbone of the retail media boom of the past few years.

One that Google has largely sat out, allowing for the rise of huge threats like Amazon ads, as well as new rivals like Target, Instacart, Kroger and even Uber.

Is it possible that the explosion in conversational, AI-driven search could provide Google a do-over in retail media?

Earlier this week, Google and Walmart announced a deal that would see Walmart products not only featured in Google Gemini (the company’s answer to ChatGPT), but easy for consumers to buy them right from their AI chat. This pact follows a recent tie-up between Walmart and ChatGPT.

Could this be an entry point for Google to not only get a piece of retail media spending - which still appears to have a ton of upside - and even reshape digital shopping? That feels like a big leap, yet at the rate that AI is fundamentally altering the consumer internet experience, all bets are off. A few things to consider:

We don’t quite know yet how retail media ads will work in AI searches, if at all. Will consumers be as responsive? Will the ROI be as strong?

Even before we get to advertising, we don’t know how people will shop via AI engines. Historically, when people have used search engines to shop, they wanted choice, and there was a perceived neutrality. Yet increasingly, AI search is about answers.

If a person does find the shopping ‘answer’ they were looking for via an AI interface, the new promise is that they’ll be able to buy right there. Yet at least initially, many of these ‘check out within the AI chat’ integrations appear quite limited. From Jason Del Ray’s recently launched The Aisle newsletter: “Like with the other AI checkout launches, Google’s new shopping experience is limited by support for single-item purchases only, with payments flowing through Google Pay using credentials stored in Google Wallet. Google says PayPal support is coming, with other payment options expected later. No word on exact timing.” That seems like kind of a pain in the ass no?

Also - how will ChatGPT, Gemini and others balance commercial relationships with their perceived objectivity? Seemingly, shoppers won’t like - and may soon catch on - if and when the answer to every product search is something from Walmart.

To that end, what’s to stop OpenAI and Gemini, Claude, etc. from making retail partnerships with all the big players - from Albertsons to Home Depot to Best Buy? How do they make every partner happy without overly commercializing the experience?

It is interesting to note that Walmart has to date relied on the Trade Desk to power its retail media business. The Trade Desk has long touted itself as a champion of the open web, and a counter to Google. Meanwhile, Google and its AI rivals are supposedly choking off the open web. But here are Walmart and Google proving that above all populist digital causes, business is business.

It will be fascinating to see just how big of a player Google and Gemini can be in the future of shopping. There is little reason for people to abandon relying on Amazon for day-to-day products, and its instant gratification (do I really need AI to help me when I know what I want to buy?). Plus, more consumers are finding shopping inspiration on social platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Are we sure that AI shoppability changes that?

From Google’s point of view - maybe retailers were never going to let the company power their fledgling retail media businesses a few years back. Plus, Google was focused on going after the TV market with YouTube (a good bet it turned out), while fending off more than one regulatory lawsuit.

Yet this time around, maybe AI gives the company another shot at becoming a shopping player, or at least a retail media contender.

Legacy YouTubers Embrace Appointment TV

This Friday at 9p.m. ET, the show Smosh Hospital will premiere on YouTube. The debut is noteworthy for a number of reasons.

For starters, it’s another example of a prominent YouTube production brand embracing longer-form originals and TV-like scheduling tactics.

It’s also an unlikely story (at least in my view) of YouTuber longevity - as Smosh - originally just a two-man comedy operation, has survived numerous sales and media partnerships, as well as multiple YouTube eras.

I had Alessandra Catanese, Smosh’s Chief Executive Officer, on my podcast this week, to chat about the company’s impressive endurance, and its growing ambitions as a programmer.

“The last time we did a format like this was sitcom and it blew up on TikTok. We had audience members being like, ‘I don’t know who these people are, where do I watch this?’ That’s exactly what we’re [trying to remedy] with Hospital in January. Who wouldn’t love to see comedians performing in this way where we’re parodying the “Grey’s Anatomy” or “General Hospital” of it all.”

“We’re staying true to who we are and especially when we’re on YouTube - we can get away with a lot more than traditional [media platforms]…we respect and we honor the fact that our audience wants something particular from a platform like YouTube.”

On where YouTube is headed from a TV perspective:

“My sneaking suspicion with YouTube is… we’ll start to see, especially with the features that they’ve started to roll out to channels like ours, where there’s seasonality, there’s episodes, they’re starting to get you to categorize your content think that there’s a delineation that they’re trying to slowly make in a very smart and strategic way between YouTube and its TV viewing and YouTube as a search engine.”

On what brands still don’t get about today’s creators:

“Any brand is gonna have its issues. Even brands who are really, really great to work with on the creative side, still struggle with the idea that Smosh is not, or creators in general, you know, aren’t the same as they used to be. It used to be, ‘I’m in my bedroom and I’m making this video.’ Oftentimes we get brands who are like, ‘you know what, we actually can’t upload tomorrow. Let’s kick it to next week. We weren’t able to get legal to approve in time.’ And we’re like, ‘hey, like that’s how it works for us. We have a consistent schedule that our audience is expecting.’”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sE13!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5139c9e-3160-4333-840c-31532bbb3003_1024x1024.png",N,,2026-01-13 08:01:51.418796

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) share price is up 17% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 4.3%.

The past week has proven to be lucrative for Agilent Technologies investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

Over half a decade, Agilent Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 3% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

This free interactive report on Agilent Technologies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Agilent Technologies, it has a TSR of 21% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

Agilent Technologies provided a TSR of 5.1% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 4% per year over five year. This suggests the company might be improving over time. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

We will like Agilent Technologies better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued stocks (mostly small caps) with considerable, recent, insider buying.

Profit falls but tops expectations, while full-year revenue rises to a record amid growing demand for premium products

A Delta jet taking off from Los Angeles International Airport. Delta had called for an about $200 million hit related to the U.S. government shutdown.

Delta Air Lines on Tuesday reported holiday-quarter profit that beat expectations and record full-year revenue, sidestepping a temporary knock on air-travel demand thanks to the U.S. government shutdown.

But the air carrier's stock (DAL) fell as adjusted revenue for the final quarter of the year came up a bit short of forecasts.

Net income rose to $1.22 billion from $843 million in the same period a year ago, while adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, declined to $1.55 from $1.85.

Operating revenue grew 2.9% to $16 billion, while adjusted revenue rose 1.2% to $14.61 billion.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected the airline to report adjusted EPS of $1.53 on adjusted sales of $14.68 billion.

The stock dropped 5.7% in premarket trading, which puts it on track for its worst one-day performance in nine months.

Wall Street analysts had trimmed their quarterly expectations over the past few months for Delta and other air carriers because of the shutdown. At the end of October, the FactSet EPS consensus was $1.75 and the revenue consensus was $14.92 billion.

For the full year, revenue adjusted revenue rose 2.3% to a record 58.3 billion.

""High-margin, diversified revenue streams grew high-single digits over prior year and reached 60% of total revenue, reflecting the power of Delta's brand, growing demand for our premium products and the success of our integrated commercial and customer strategy,"" said Delta President Glen Hauenstein.

Delta said last month that U.S. government shutdown-related flight cancellations and cooling demand right before Thanksgiving would cost it about $200 million in the fourth quarter.

The news lifted the stock then, however, as Wall Street seemed relieved the fallout from the shutdown hadn't been steeper. Delta also said that its December demand had remained healthy and trending up for early 2026.

Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian was a vocal critic of the shutdown's effects on air travel, and also saying that airlines were used as a ""political football"" amid the funding impasse in Washington, which lasted 43 days and became the longest shutdown in history.

Airlines lost booking momentum when some customers turned skittish and made other plans ahead of Thanksgiving holiday as the shutdown ground on. In early November, the Trump administration imposed flight cuts at major U.S. airports, citing safety concerns around staff shortages.

Air-traffic controllers, classified as essential personnel, worked through the funding impasse, with pay deferred until the end of the shutdown. Staffing shortages, however, had triggered flight delays and cancellations even before the flight cuts took effect.

There's a ""constructive fundamental backdrop"" this year for airlines, analysts at BofA Securities said in a recent note. Positive industry trends include better demand and ""easy comparisons"" from macroeconomic volatility the first half of last year.

Delta's shares have gained about 9% in the past 12 months through Monday, lagging a 20% gain for the S&P 500 index SPX in the same period.

Balyasny hired Nikoloaos Rapanos, a portfolio manager at Eisler Capital, for its macro trading team. According to his LinkedIn, he joined the fund last year and is based in London.

Rapanos spent 18 months at Eisler in what was his first fully-fledged PM role. Prior to that, he spent six years at macro hedge fund Caxton Associates as a sub-PM in its global macro team. Rapanos has a PhD in finance and previously worked as an associate at Goldman Sachs.

He's one of many Eisler alums to join Balyasny, which has a thing for Eisler's quant strats. Last week, we reported on Tibor Kucs who joined to lead a team of equities quant researchers.

Other strats have joined as portfolio managers; Alexander Alekseev, a top systematic equities PM, joined in October to build out a team and took five other Eisler people with him. Rapanos may not have been a strat at Eisler but spent much of his time at Caxton working in quant research.

The MiniMed Go Smart MDI system combines the InPen smart insulin pen and Abbott’s Instinct sensor, with both linked via the MiniMed Go app.

The system provides personalised, real-time insights and actionable guidance.

Features include action-oriented guidance for missed or miscalculated doses, a dose calculator to simplify decision-making, missed dose alerts to help reduce glucose highs, and CareLink software reporting to facilitate collaboration between patients and healthcare providers.

The MiniMed Go system has received clearance for individuals aged seven and older with insulin-requiring T1D or T2D, and for children between two and six years old when supervised by an adult.

Globally, more than 15 million individuals depend on multiple daily injections to manage diabetes. Mealtime insulin dosing can be challenging and may lead to distress. Missed boluses can affect glycaemic outcomes; even missing two doses per week may increase HbA1C by up to 0.4%, which raises complication risks, said Medtronic.

Real-world data from users of Medtronic’s previous Smart MDI system showed improvements in glycaemic control when responding promptly to alerts. Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when more than 75% of missed dose alerts were addressed within an hour and rose to 71.5% when users responded to correct high glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour.

Medtronic diabetes EVP and president and MiniMed CEO-designate Que Dallara said: “For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful.

“MiniMed Go is designed to change that, bringing the smarts of an AID [automated insulin delivery] system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen.”

Commercial launch of the MiniMed Go Smart MDI system in the US is expected in early 2026.

In December 2025, Medtronic commercially launched its MiniMed 780G system in the US, which was then integrated with Abbott’s Instinct sensor.

Whether you’re a contract testing lab, industrial manufacturer, remediation company, or regulator, staying up to date with evolving PFAS regulations and analytical developments is crucial. In this article, you’ll discover emerging trends, key method considerations, practical tips for staying informed, and Agilent solutions tailored to your needs.

What are PFAS?

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent and ubiquitous contaminants that do not biodegrade. Nicknamed ‘forever chemicals,’ these industrial and commercial compounds — commonly used in medical devices, consumer products, food packaging, and kitchenware — are being routinely detected in different environments across the globe. Concerns are mounting over their potential impacts on human health, with recent studies demonstrating the negative effects of PFAS on the human immune system.

Why is there a concern?

Emerging research has found that PFAS bind to proteins in exposed organisms and are resistant to metabolic degradation and excretion. They also biomagnify – in other words, their concentration increases in the tissues of organisms as they progress up the food chain. Therefore, by the time they reach the fish or livestock that humans consume, their levels can be significantly higher than in the original source. Many health effects of PFAS remain under investigation, and new PFAS compounds are still being discovered.

Regulatory action is accelerating. The growing concerns around persistent organic pollutants have recently prompted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce federal regulation on five PFAS, marking the first regulated chemicals in more than 20 years. They have also proposed that nine PFAS be categorised as hazardous to human health under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Furthermore, in a bid to raise awareness of the PFAS pollution problem, the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), in cooperation with ChemSec, tested 11 politicians for PFAS contamination, with five exceeding levels of concern. According to the EEB, the results of this study mirror the average levels of exposure across Europe.

PFAS testing is a growing challenge for industries, regulators, and testing labs worldwide. As awareness rises, so does the demand for accurate testing to understand where these chemicals occur and how to manage them. But before jumping into this market, labs must ask a critical question: What does it really take to get PFAS testing right?

What must labs consider before entering the PFAS market?

Defining your goals

Before entering the PFAS testing market, it’s essential to clearly define your objectives — because your approach will vary depending on your role and responsibilities. Consider what those goals may look like in the following scenarios:

Contract testing labs: Determine which matrices to test and to what levels. Identify regulatory or testing methods you need to follow, along with any compliance and accreditation needs.

Industrial manufacturers: Conduct testing to meet regulatory guidance or discharge permits, whether that’s for your raw materials or waste discharge.

Regulators trying to identify new PFAS: Investigate the tools you’ll need to discover currently unknown PFAS.

Engineering firms or remediation companies: Identify if the treatment is removing PFAS, but also ensure you are not creating them or converting them into other by-products in the process.

Method considerations

Effective PFAS testing relies on a robust workflow — from suitable sample preservation to comprehensive sample preparation and precise analysis.

Sample preservation

PFAS often have surface-active properties, making them susceptible to adhering to sample vessels. Therefore, secure sample preservation and transportation methods are critical to ensure sample integrity during transit and storage.

Sample preparation and cleanup

Sample preparation is essential for isolating PFAS from diverse matrices like drinking water, soil, and air. Specific procedures can remove interfering substances from samples to ensure high purity and minimise background noise. Enrichment techniques and cleanup steps may also be necessary before sample analysis to further optimise detection limits and enhance recovery from challenging environmental samples.

Analysis

In targeted PFAS analysis, LC/TQ is typically used due to its exceptional sensitivity and selectivity. However, this technique is restricted to compounds with available analytical standards and relatively polar compounds that ionise well in LC/MS. For nonpolar and volatile PFAS, GC/MS is often preferred. When the goal is nontargeted analysis to identify large amounts of unknown PFAS, high-resolution LC/MS systems such as LC/Q-TOF are increasingly favoured.

Each of these techniques must be critically accompanied by high-performance, regulatory-compliant software to analyse and report the data according to compliance and accreditation requirements.

Trends emerging in specific sectors

PFAS testing is evolving rapidly, with several trends emerging in different sectors. Understanding these developments is essential for staying compliant and competitive as regulations tighten and analytical methods advance.

Food industry

With increased scrutiny around the use of PFAS in food packaging and foodstuffs, the food sector is feeling the pressure to make changes. Testing for PFAS in food is becoming more common as companies seek to comply with evolving regulations and respond to consumer demand for safer products. Many companies are phasing out harmful long-chain PFAS and replacing them with shorter-chain PFAS that demonstrate reduced bioaccumulation. Many are also adopting PFAS-free, nonfluorinated compounds to meet consumer demand for safer products. Because food supply chains are global, regulations in one region often influence practices worldwide.

Water treatment

Advances in water treatment technologies are driving new testing methods. As regulations become stricter, there is a need for more sensitive and accurate testing to ensure compliance with lower detection limits. Furthermore, thermal destruction techniques used to break down PFAS also require robust testing of by-products to ensure they do not introduce new contaminants.

Consumer products

The push for PFAS-free consumer products is leading to more comprehensive testing protocols. This includes testing for a broader range of PFAS compounds and ensuring that alternatives do not pose similar risks.

Environmental monitoring

To identify unknown PFAS compounds in the environment, nontargeted analysis techniques such as high-resolution mass spectrometry are gaining traction as a way to understand the full extent of PFAS contamination and its impact.

Air monitoring

As more volatile PFAS compounds are being discovered as part of manufacturing processes, incineration, and everyday product use, testing for PFAS in air has become a big focus of the industry.

Regulatory trends on the horizon

Staying up to date with emerging regulatory trends is crucial to ensure your PFAS testing is compliant and meets demand. Several regulatory trends are emerging to be aware of:

U.S. EPA drinking water standards: The U.S. EPA has set the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standards for certain PFAS, with this trend set to continue for more PFAS as research evolves.

EU bans and restrictions: The EU aims to phase out at least 10,000 PFAS by 2030 to help manage risks.

Reporting and recordkeeping requirements: The US and EU are tightening their rules on reporting and recordkeeping from manufacturers and industry.

Global harmonisation of PFAS regulations: Countries are increasingly aligning their regulatory frameworks with international standards, such as those set by the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions.

These trends highlight the importance of staying informed and compliant with evolving regulations to effectively manage PFAS-related risks.

How to stay current with regulations

To stay ahead of evolving PFAS regulations and industry best practices, consider these practical steps:

Regularly participate in meetings, webinars, and conferences hosted by regulatory agencies like the U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency for firsthand updates on environmental regulatory changes, and the U.S. FDA and EFSA for food safety regulations and emerging trends.

Subscribe to newsletters from reputable sources such as the EPA, Environmental Law Institute, and industry-specific publications, which highlight recent regulatory updates and provide expert analysis.

Join professional organisations such as the American Chemical Society and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, which provide exclusive access to resources like regulatory updates, research findings, and networking opportunities.

Utilise online databases and tools that track regulatory changes and provide comprehensive information on toxicology and occurrence data. For example: the OECD Global Database of PFAS, the EU European Environment Agency and their Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring, the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed portal, and the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard.

Establish connections with other professionals in the field to share insights and experiences.

Engage with instrument suppliers like Agilent, who collaborate with regulatory bodies and participate in standards committees and conferences. They often share early updates on testing requirements and emerging best practices.

(CATL) said it is nearing completion on what could be one of Europe’s largest electric vehicle battery factories, a fresh example of advanced Chinese manufacturing gaining international recognition.

Over the years, China’s manufacturing sector has steadily upgraded and integrated itself into international industrial networks. With a growing focus on high-tech and clean-energy production, it now provides robust manufacturing capabilities and supports more resilient supply chains, creating opportunities for global partnerships in emerging industries.

WHY MADE IN CHINA?

As of 2024, China’s manufacturing sector has been the world’s largest for 15 consecutive years, growing steadily at home while continuing to attract foreign investment.

In the first 11 months of 2025, China attracted 693.18 billion yuan (about 98.25 billion U.S. dollars) in actual foreign direct investment, with manufacturing alone receiving 171.72 billion yuan (around 24.4 billion dollars), roughly one-quarter of the total.

But why China? How has its manufacturing sector grown from a modest industrial base into a vast, interconnected system deeply embedded in global production networks within decades?

The answer may be glimpsed in more than 40 years of reform and opening-up, which allowed the country to engage in labor-intensive manufacturing for multinational companies. The accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 further opened the door for the country to emerge as a major hub for processing and manufacturing.

Supported by plentiful labor resources, strong infrastructure, and favorable policies, China’s manufacturing sector grew at an average annual rate of 12 percent between 1995 and 2015, and since then gradually built broad industrial capabilities across sectors such as automotive, machinery, medical devices, and consumer electronics.

These structural advantages have long attracted global manufacturers, including Michelin, which has steadily expanded its operations in China.

In September, Michelin celebrated the 30th anniversary of its Shenyang plant — the group’s first factory in China and now its largest and most advanced high-end tire manufacturing base in the world.

Established in 1995 as a joint venture, the plant has expanded steadily, with new production lines added in 2010 and 2018, advanced silent tire lines introduced in 2019, and a 40-million-euro (about 43-million-dollar) investment in 2024 to further raise capacity.

“Michelin Shenyang is a milestone for Michelin in China,” said Matthew Ye, president and CEO of Michelin Greater China & Mongolia, noting “the plant’s success vividly embodies the deep integration of the Michelin spirit with the Chinese market.”

“The Chinese market remains one of the most dynamic and promising for Michelin globally, featuring not only a vast consumer base and a rapidly upgrading automotive industry, but also an increasingly robust supply chain and a continuously improving business environment,” said Ye, highlighting the wider attractiveness of China’s industrial ecosystem.

INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING IN CHINA

Building on a well-established industrial base, Chinese industry has gradually moved from producing mainly low-value goods such as shoes, garments and basic consumer products to a broader range of high-value, technology-intensive products, including electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and advanced industrial robots.

The year 2024 is a good example: Value added by high-tech manufacturing firms above a designated scale was 42 percent higher than in 2020, with clean energy-related production forming a key part of this growth.

This transition has been accompanied by the rapid spread of intelligent manufacturing across China’s industrial sector, now spanning tens of thousands of factories and production facilities nationwide.

At GAC Aion’s Guangzhou plant, robotic arms work almost non-stop along assembly lines, producing a vehicle every 53 seconds in a “dark factory” where lights are rarely needed. Similar facilities are now emerging across China, with the country accounting for more than half of the world’s newly installed industrial robots in 2024, according to the International Federation of Robotics.

China’s fully integrated industrial system places it in a unique position within the global supply chain landscape, said Yin Zheng, executive vice president of Schneider Electric’s China & East Asia Operations.

“What the industry needs now are supply chains that are not only efficient but also resilient and green, a view that is increasingly shared across sectors,” Yin said.

SHARED OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE

As China’s manufacturing capabilities are moving up the value chain, multinational companies are increasingly viewing the country not only as a production base or consumer market, but also as a platform for research, rapid application and technology iteration.

Speaking to Xinhua at the 2025 International Motor Show Germany in Munich, Oliver Zipse, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG, said China’s innovation is crucial for BMW’s global strategy.

“The combination of German engineering expertise with China’s extensive supplier network and local innovation creates a unique global advantage,” Zipse said.

Upgrades in China’s manufacturing sector are also reshaping opportunities in the global energy transition. As climate targets tighten and the window for cutting emissions narrows, the pace, scale and affordability of clean-energy deployment have become central concerns for governments and industries worldwide.

The U.S. academic journal Science named the renewable energy surge as the 2025 Breakthrough of the Year, noting that China’s mighty industrial engine is the driver.

Quoting Britain-based Carbon Brief, it said solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and wind turbines exported from China in 2024 are set to cut annual CO2 emissions in the rest of the world by 1 percent.

Beyond delivering cost-effective green products at scale, China’s manufacturing upgrades are creating practical entry points for international collaboration in green technology.

Chinese firms have pledged roughly 200 billion dollars in overseas clean energy investments since 2022, reported The Wired in December, noting that this is “beginning to narrow the gap in funding needed to slash the world’s climate pollution.”

With rising global demand for low-carbon technologies and the urgent need to accelerate the energy transition, Chinese manufacturers are increasingly embedding themselves in overseas industrial ecosystems, extending collaboration across production, technology, talent, and industrial capacity.

In Uzbekistan, Chinese photovoltaic giant LONGi partnered with international firms to develop Central Asia’s first large-scale green hydrogen project, which is expected to cut about 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year compared with traditional hydrogen production models.

“Our cooperation model connects China’s technology with local energy strategies,” said Zhang Wenyin, head of strategy and marketing at LONGi Hydrogen. “It also helps partner countries cultivate local talent and industrial capacity.”

FORGING AHEAD ON GREEN TRANSITION

China has stayed on course in advancing the green transition despite policy shifts in some Western countries. Several major economies, including the United States and the European Union, have recently revised automotive policies, easing rules for conventional vehicles.

In the United States, this came after the federal electric-vehicle tax credit expired in September, with a late-2025 proposal to slash Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Meanwhile, the European Commission announced plans to drop its effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035, marking a notable retreat from its green policies.

These moves, while giving conventional vehicles more policy flexibility during the transition period, have also posed challenges for advancing green transition goals in these markets.

Amid signs of slowing and recalibrating parts of the global green transition, Chinese green manufacturing companies continue to deliver more clean-energy products to global markets.

In September, Chinese automaker BYD saw its 1,000th electric bus roll off the production line at its Hungarian bus factory, and it plans to expand the bus factory with an additional 29,000 square meters of production facilities to further increase annual capacity for electric buses and trucks.

Since delivering its first European order in 2013, more than 5,000 BYD electric buses have been deployed across over 160 cities in 26 European countries.

Additional bank earnings will highlight the earnings calendar later this week.

An optimistic consensus is forming: Wall Street analysts estimate S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies will report an earnings per share growth rate of 8.3% for Q4, according to FactSet data. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index.

Heading into the reporting period, analysts have raised their earnings expectations, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters. On Sept. 30, the consensus estimate for S&P 500 fourth quarter earnings growth stood at 7.2%.

Although Big Tech continues to set the tone, this earnings season promises to test the improved stock market breadth that has emerged at the start of 2026. Plus, the themes that drove the markets in 2025 — artificial intelligence, the Trump administration's tariff and economic policies, and a K-shaped consumer economy — will continue to provide plenty for investors to parse.

The major financial companies will round out the earnings docket this week. In addition to Delta and JPMorgan, investors will hear from Bank of New York Mellon (BK) on Tuesday; Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Wednesday; and BlackRock (BLK), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Friday.

GALWAY, Ireland, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of its MiniMed Go™ app. The MiniMed Go™ Smart Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) system seamlessly integrates the InPen™ smart insulin pen with the Instinct sensor made by Abbott — all connected through the MiniMed Go™ app. This powerful combination delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance, including:

Missed dose alerts to help minimize glucose highs

A dose calculator that simplifies dose decision-making

Action-oriented guidance if a user misses or miscalculates a dose

CareLink™ software reporting for easier provider collaboration

The MiniMed Go™ system is cleared for individuals with insulin-requiring type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged 7 years and older, as well as for children ages 2 to 6 years under the supervision of an adult caregiver. Compatibility of the Simplera™ sensor with MiniMed Go™ is currently under FDA review.

Addressing a Significant Unmet Need

There are more than 15 million people around the world with diabetes who rely on multiple daily injections. For these individuals, mealtimes can feel overwhelming and exhausting — and over time, this can lead to diabetes distress.1,2 This involves determining the amount of carbs in their meal and calculating the right insulin dose to inject before eating (bolus) to keep blood sugar levels in check to avoid dangerous spikes or dips.

Missed boluses can significantly impact diabetes management and glycemic outcomes. Even skipping just two doses a week can raise HbA1C by as much as 0.4%, increasing the risk of both short- and long-term complications.3 Remembering when and how much insulin to dose isn't just a math problem — it's a daily burden that adds stress and fatigue, making diabetes management feel overwhelming.

Real-world data demonstrates that users of the previous generation Medtronic Smart MDI system saw meaningful improvements in glycemic control when consistently responding to actionable alerts. Specifically, the data showed that Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when users addressed more than 75% of Missed Dose alerts within an hour, and to 71.5% when users addressed Correct High Glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour. These results underscore the power of timely, actionable insights in helping users achieve better glycemic outcomes.4 The new MiniMed Go™ Smart MDI System delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance to optimize outcomes for users.

""For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and president of Medtronic Diabetes and CEO-designate of MiniMed. ""MiniMed Go™ is designed to change that — bringing the smarts of an AID system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen. The system helps take the guesswork out of MDI therapy, delivering simplicity and confidence in every dose. We're pleased to expand our full-stack insulin delivery solutions, making it seamless for our customers to find a therapy that works for them — no matter where they are in their journey.""

We expect the commercial launch of the MiniMed Go™ system to begin in the U.S. this spring. Learn more here about MiniMed Go™.

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta’s board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump’s first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State’s office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She’s also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta’s board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta’s management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump’s orbit.

Mining is the “keystone industry” that props up the arch of the global economy – almost every good and service is enabled by mining, and mining itself is not possible without copper – the red metal is the “keystone commodity.”

Read more:How mining became the planet’s unlikely saviour

The report – Copper in the Age of AI: The Challenges of Electrification – projects that annual copper demand will soar 50% from current levels by 2040 to 42 million metric tonnes as the pace of electrification accelerates to meet vectors of demand, old and new.

But its projections for supply underline a darkening disconnect, with production seen peaking at 33 million metric tonnes by 2030.

Even with an expected over-doubling of supplies of recycled copper scrap over that timeline to 10 million tonnes, it all adds up to a yawning chasm with an expected shortfall of 10 million tonnes, or around 25% of anticipated demand.

What this means

Copper is the enabler of the global economy, and demand will outrun supply unless there is major adjustment across the copper supply system.

Processing, for example, is heavily concentrated in China and the report calls for multilateral cooperation and more regional diversification. It also calls for faster permitting for new mines and a “time clock on litigation’ on this front.

This does not mean the sector can just go out and trash the planet. But mining is no longer the wrecking ball it once was and for wider environmental outcomes such as the green energy transition, we need more copper, faster.

“Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the great enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for copper,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at S&P Global who co-chaired the study.

“Economic demand, grid expansion, renewable generation, AI computation, digital industries, electric vehicles and defence are scaling all at once – and supply is not on track to keep pace. At stake is whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.”

Such shortfalls for such a critical metal will also send its price into the stratosphere, with huge implications for global supply chains and inflation.

There are many moving parts to this unfolding saga, which explains why copper is so high on the radar screens of mining boardrooms – and why so many governments have classified it as “critical”.

On the production side, the bottom line is that new economically extractable deposits are not being discovered at the pace required to meet projected demand. Even if new mother lodes are suddenly uncovered, it takes, on average, 17 years for a new copper mine to begin production from a discovery.

That means any major new copper find that comes to light this year will probably not begin extracting the stuff before 2043. And the supply of qualified geologists and mining engineers is also in decline.

“The copper sector faces a host of challenges above and below ground, ranging from declining ore grades; rising costs for energy, labour and other inputs; increasingly complex and difficult extraction conditions; environmental opposition, lengthy judicial reviews and pressures from investors and governments,” S&P notes.

While grades and production decline, demand is seen rising robustly on four broad fronts, with a potential fifth one on the horizon.

The rise of the machines

AI and data centre demand is one emerging sphere, and the other is increased defence spending in an era marked by escalating geopolitical tensions. Data centres and weapons have one big thing in common: they need copper.

Demand from these two sources is seen tripling by 2040, representing a combined four million metric tonnes of additional demand.

What the report refers to as “core demand” – power generation, construction, electrical appliances, shipping, aviation and much more – will remain the largest market for copper, and it is also on a rapid growth trajectory.

“In the developing world, a combination of urbanisation, rising incomes, and changing building practices means electricity use and thus more copper. One vivid example: the developing world is projected to add as many as two billion new air conditioners by 2040,” the report says.

Clean energy transition

Another copper-hungry sector that has been taking off is the clean energy transition. Electric vehicles require almost three times as much copper as a conventional car, and solar and wind also need an abundance of the metal.

“And now a possible new vector of demand is on the horizon – humanoid robots,” the report says.

“There is much variance in projections for their scale by 2040 – varying from tens of millions to hundreds of millions to a billion or more. Whatever the actual number, these humanoids will not just be wired – but heavily wired – with copper.”

The report is a sobering reminder of our dependence on copper and ultimately mining, and the clock is ticking.",https://cdn.dailymaverick.co.za/i/0fXRTXpk9jUcLlfs4lZt09a-Ym8=/800x0/smart/filters:strip_exif()/file/dailymaverick/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-516808124.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 04:13:50.234974

Walmart's stock rallies into record territory, after the retailer teams with Google's Gemini to help drive customers to its products

Walmart's focus on technology to drive sales has helped lift its stock to record territory, a month after the company switched its stock-market listing to the Nasdaq. Outgoing Walmart CEO Doug McMillon shared a laugh with Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman at a Dec. 9 opening-bell ceremony.

Shares of Walmart surged into record territory Monday as the retail behemoth's latest moves highlight its focus on technology to drive sales.

Walmart (WMT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google announced over the weekend that they were teaming up to launch a new shopping experience that will use artificial intelligence through Google's Gemini to help drive customers to products sold at Walmart's stores.

The announcement came about a month after Walmart moved the listing of its stock to the Nasdaq exchange from the New York Stock Exchange, a move that the retailer said aligned with its ""tech-powered approach"" to its retail strategy.

The stock climbed 3.4% in recent midday trading, putting it on track to end the day above the Dec. 15 record close price of $116.79. The rally was boosting Walmart's market capitalization to $944.2 billion, which makes Walmart the 11th most valuable U.S. company.

With Walmart's latest AI move, Gemini's answers to questions for assistance or advice will include products sold at its stores, as part of the new Universal Commerce Protocol, an open standard for AI agent-led commerce that Walmart said it built.

An example Walmart provided in how the collaboration would work was if Gemini is asked for advice on camping equipment, it will show items from Walmart and provide access to purchase the items.

Walmart's AI push makes sense. A report earlier this month from Salesforce (CRM) said shoppers referred to e-commerce sites from AI agents converted into actual sales nine times more often than those referred from social media.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" said John Furner, Walmart's incoming CEO. ""We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.""

Late Friday, the Nasdaq said it would add Walmart's stock to the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX as of Jan. 20.

While Nasdaq said the index is made up of 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies, it is often referred to as the ""tech-heavy"" Nasdaq-100, given that the current top 11 weighted components - more than 70% of the total weighting - are technology companies.

Walmart's stock will replace drugmaker AstraZeneca's (AZN) in the Nasdaq-100. AstraZeneca was the 16th-highest-weighted Nasdaq-100 component, with a market cap of $291.9 billion.

The average UberEats or DoorDash tip has since dropped to just 76 cents per delivery.
But for the apps that kept the tipping option before checkout, like Grubhub, workers earn an average tip of $2.17 per order, according to DCWP's analysis.
Council Member Shaun Abreu (D-Manhattan), the tipping law's lead sponsor, blasted the companies' post-checkout tipping practices as harmful to workers.
""When corporations claim that delivery workers are overpaid and app profits are too low, we know they are lying.","Delivery workers have lost as much as $550 million in tips since Uber and DoorDash changed their apps so that the tip option appears only after customers place their orders, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection charged in a new report.

The findings come as the companies sue the city over a law set to go into effect on Jan. 26 that requires them to offer the option to tip at or before checkout.

New York City's landmark minimum pay law, which guarantees delivery workers $21.44 per hour, went into effect in December 2023. The day the law went into effect, Uber and DoorDash introduced new after-checkout tipping policies in order to hide the higher costs wrought by the new minimum pay standards.

The average tip for a worker making deliveries for UberEats and DoorDash decreased from $3.66 per delivery to 93 cents per delivery in just one week after the companies moved the tipping option, DCWP found. The average UberEats or DoorDash tip has since dropped to just 76 cents per delivery.

But for the apps that kept the tipping option before checkout, like Grubhub, workers earn an average tip of $2.17 per order, according to DCWP's analysis.

“Our report blows the whistle on a massive scheme by Uber and DoorDash to drive down worker pay by more than $550 million. That era has come to an end,” DCWP Commissioner Sam Levine said in a statement. “If these companies do not follow new tipping laws going into effect later this month, they will face significant consequences.”

Uber and DoorDash filed their lawsuit in mid-December, alleging that the new law requiring tipping options before checkout violates their free speech and arguing that it would damage their businesses. The suit cited ""tipping fatigue"" and DoorDash went as far as to accuse the City Council of worsening an ""affordability crisis.""

""In the midst of an affordability crisis, the New York City Council has turned tipping into essentially an added tax by forcing platforms like DoorDash to pressure consumers to tip at checkout,"" DoorDash said at the time.

But both DoorDash and Uber have continued to rake in large profits from food delivery since the minimum pay went into effect, defying their claims to the contrary.

Monthly reports from DoorDash and UberEats show that after the minimum pay law began in Dec. 2023 through June 2025, they earned a combined revenue of $948 million more than what they paid in wages to workers, court filings show.

On Jan. 5, DCWP filed a memorandum in opposition to the app giants' request to stop the law from going into effect as the lawsuit works its way through the courts. Federal Judge George Daniels in the Southern District of New York has yet to rule on the companies' requested injunction; the next hearing is on Jan. 14.

Council Member Shaun Abreu (D-Manhattan), the tipping law's lead sponsor, blasted the companies' post-checkout tipping practices as harmful to workers.

""If someone wants to tip them, they shouldn’t have a hard time doing it. No one is ever forced to tip, and making it more difficult to do so is plain wrong,"" Abreu said in a statement. ""When corporations claim that delivery workers are overpaid and app profits are too low, we know they are lying. True affordability comes from treating consumers and workers fairly, not manipulating how people tip.""

Uber did not respond to requests for comment. DoorDash issued Streetsblog a similar comment as it did last year, changing the opening from ""In the midst of an affordability crisis,"" to “In the midst of an affordability crisis and growing frustration over tipping culture ... the Council plans to force platforms like DoorDash to pressure customers to tip at checkout even though customers can already tip after delivery for a job well done.""

The company claims that its workers are ""averaging closer to $30 an hour before tips,"" though it did not provide evidence. The company claims its lawsuit ""is about fighting rising costs and ensuring delivery remains fast and affordable for all New Yorkers.”",https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/delivery-worker-e-bike-JOCO.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:59:07.450049

In 2026, the VOC control systems market stands at USD 5.8 billion and is projected to reach USD 13.4 billion by 2036, implying a CAGR of 8.7%. Deployment is driven primarily by regulatory compliance in industries such as chemicals, coatings, printing, pharmaceuticals, and food processing, where volatile organic compound emissions are monitored and limited. System choice depends on concentration levels, exhaust volumes, and process continuity requirements rather than on equipment price alone. Capital decisions are often tied to permitting, plant expansions, or process changes, which makes demand episodic rather than continuous. Geographic concentration follows regions with strict air quality standards and active enforcement regimes.

Operating economics and liability exposure shape adoption behavior across different sectors. Facilities weigh destruction efficiency, energy consumption, uptime risk, and maintenance burden when selecting between thermal oxidation, adsorption, or recovery based systems. Compliance audits, reporting obligations, and inspection frequency influence replacement and upgrade timing. In some regions, incentives or carbon related programs alter technology preference, while elsewhere enforcement relies mainly on penalties. Supplier positioning depends on the ability to support engineering, installation, and long term service. The market expands through regulatory tightening and process modernization, not through discretionary environmental upgrades or uniform industrial expansion.

What is the Growth Forecast for VOC Control Systems Market through 2036?

The VOC control systems market expands in step with regulatory enforcement and industrial capacity additions rather than with discretionary environmental spending. At roughly USD 3.3 billion at the start of the period, the market moves through USD 3.9 billion and USD 4.7 billion as coatings, chemicals, printing, and pharmaceuticals add abatement capacity to meet permitting and compliance thresholds. When spending reaches about USD 5.8 billion, the category is no longer driven only by new plants. Retrofits, line extensions, and process changes begin to account for a large share of orders. Growth is anchored in thermal oxidizers, adsorption systems, and hybrid configurations sized to specific exhaust streams, which makes project value depend more on process complexity and airflow volumes than on simple equipment counts.

As industrial output and compliance coverage widen, the market advances through approximately USD 6.9 billion, USD 8.2 billion, and USD 9.7 billion, with demand increasingly tied to multi-line facilities and integrated emission management programs. By the time spending passes about USD 10.6 billion and then moves toward USD 11.6 and USD 12.4 billion, replacement and system upgrades become as important as first-time installations. Approaching roughly USD 13.4 billion, value growth is driven by higher specification systems, energy recovery integration, and tighter monitoring requirements rather than by a surge in the number of regulated sites. The economics remain compliance-led and project-based, with purchasing decisions dominated by reliability, destruction efficiency, operating cost, and the ability to meet audit and permitting obligations over long operating lives.

How Is the VOC Control Systems Market Enhancing Industrial Emission Management?

VOC (volatile organic compound) control systems are increasingly adopted to reduce harmful emissions from industrial processes, chemical plants, and manufacturing facilities. Historically, industries relied on passive ventilation or basic scrubbers, which often failed to meet regulatory standards or adequately capture emissions, leading to environmental compliance risks. Modern VOC control systems integrate activated carbon adsorption, thermal oxidation, and biofiltration technologies to efficiently capture, degrade, or neutralize organic pollutants. Industrial operators, environmental compliance managers, and regulatory bodies prioritize system efficiency, reliability, and adherence to emission standards. Early adoption focused on high-emission chemical and petrochemical plants, while current demand spans paints and coatings, printing, automotive, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, driven by stringent regulatory requirements, operational safety, and process control considerations. Capture efficiency, operational reliability, and maintenance requirements influence supplier selection.

Operational compliance, workplace safety, and emission reduction objectives are shaping market growth. Compared with conventional ventilation methods, modern VOC control systems emphasize high removal efficiency, continuous monitoring, and adaptability to diverse industrial processes. Cost structures depend on technology type, material durability, and control system integration, concentrating margins among suppliers capable of delivering reliable, certified solutions. Manufacturers adopt these systems to ensure regulatory compliance, minimize environmental impact, and protect worker health. By 2036, VOC control systems are expected to become standard across industrial sectors, supporting effective emission management, operational reliability, and adherence to environmental regulations.

What Factors Are Shaping the Demand for VOC Control Systems, Segment wise by Technology Type and End Use Industry, in 2026?

The VOC control systems market in 2026 is segmented by technology type and by end use industry. By treatment method, demand is divided into thermal oxidizers, adsorption systems, biofiltration systems, and catalytic oxidizers, each offering different balances between destruction efficiency, operating cost, and maintenance complexity. By end use, demand is organized around chemical processing, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and food and beverage, which differ in emission profiles, regulatory exposure, and continuity of operation. These segments reflect how plant operators choose between capital intensive abatement equipment and lower energy or media based solutions depending on process conditions.

Why Do Thermal Oxidizers Dominate Where Compliance Risk Is Highest?

Thermal oxidizers account for about 40% of demand in 2026 because they provide a direct and highly reliable method for destroying a wide range of volatile organic compounds. In regulated environments, certainty of performance matters more than marginal differences in operating cost. Thermal systems achieve very high destruction efficiencies and are less sensitive to changes in gas composition than many alternative technologies. Once installed, they are accepted by regulators and inspectors as a robust solution. In continuous process industries, this predictability reduces compliance risk and operational disputes. These characteristics explain why thermal oxidizers remain the preferred choice in plants where emission limits are strict and interruptions are costly.

Adsorption, biofiltration, and catalytic systems serve more specific process windows. Adsorption works well for lower concentration streams but requires media replacement and regeneration management. Biofiltration suits biodegradable compounds but depends on stable biological conditions. Catalytic oxidizers reduce energy use but require clean, well controlled streams to avoid catalyst poisoning. These technologies are selected where conditions fit, yet their narrower operating envelopes limit their share compared with the broad applicability of thermal oxidation.

Why Does Chemical Processing Lead End Use Demand?

Chemical processing represents about 38% of demand in 2026 because it handles large volumes of solvent laden and hydrocarbon rich exhaust streams. Many chemical plants operate continuous processes where even short compliance failures can lead to shutdowns or penalties. This drives investment in proven, high capacity control systems rather than in marginal solutions. The diversity of products and batch processes also creates variable emission profiles, which favors technologies that can handle wide fluctuations without retuning. Capital spending in this sector is therefore closely tied to regulatory audits, plant expansions, and debottlenecking projects.

Oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and food processing follow different patterns. Oil and gas facilities often deal with fewer but larger point sources. Pharmaceutical plants emit smaller volumes but face strict documentation and validation cycles. Food and beverage operations generate more dilute and variable streams that can sometimes be treated with simpler systems. These sectors invest steadily, but none combines the scale, variability, and regulatory exposure found in chemical processing, which keeps it as the largest end use segment for VOC control systems.

How Are the Key Dynamics Reshaping the VOC Control Systems Market?

The category is being shaped by how regulators and operators manage compliance risk rather than by equipment replacement cycles. Stricter emission limits raise demand, but project timing is constrained by permitting, capital approval, and integration with production lines. At the same time, many plants are standardizing abatement platforms across sites to simplify audits, spares, and reporting. This creates tension between urgency to comply and caution about locking into the wrong technology. The result is a market driven by governance and lifecycle economics, where scale comes from programmatic rollouts and platform selection more than from one off retrofits or isolated process upgrades.

Why Are Emission Standards Driving VOC Control Systems?

Demand is anchored in enforceable limits and inspection exposure. Coating, chemicals, printing, and food processing sites face defined caps on solvent and hydrocarbon releases, with penalties that disrupt operations and reputations. As permits tighten, operators must either reduce throughput or install abatement. Control systems become enabling infrastructure that protects capacity and keeps lines running. Once a plant commits to a compliance strategy, equipment is sized to cover peak loads and remains in place for many years. Volume follows regulatory coverage expansions and new line approvals rather than discretionary efficiency projects, tying growth to rulemaking and enforcement intensity across regions.

What Is Slowing Wider Adoption of VOC Controls?

The main barrier is project risk, not technology maturity. Installation affects ducts, stacks, and process balance, and outages can be costly. Capital approval competes with production investments, especially where payback is framed as avoided fines rather than revenue. Performance depends on variable inlet loads, which makes sizing contentious and invites conservative overdesign. Energy use and consumables raise operating cost concerns. In multi-product plants, changing recipes can invalidate assumptions. These uncertainties stretch engineering studies and approvals, keeping many sites in staged upgrades or partial coverage even when compliance pressure is rising.

How Are Platforms Changing the VOC Control Systems Market?

The trend is toward standardized abatement stacks. Large operators increasingly select a small set of approved technologies and suppliers, then replicate them across sites to simplify audits, training, and spares. Controls, monitoring, and reporting are integrated into plant systems to produce consistent compliance evidence. Procurement shifts to framework agreements covering families of units and long term service. This reduces engineering variability and shortens permitting for repeat builds. Over time, competition moves from single project wins to inclusion in approved platforms, with success measured by uptime, documentation quality, and ability to support multi-site deployment programs.

Generative AI is reshaping early shopping decisions, with 45 per cent of consumers using AI for product research, reviews, and deal-hunting, as per an IBM–NRF study.
Brands must redesign journeys around AI moments, ensure data readiness, and invest in AI skills to stay competitive and build long-term trust.
As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explained, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search.
AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry.","Generative AI is reshaping the first steps of shopping experience before clicking buy, as per a new global study from the Institute for Business Value (IBM), in collaboration with the National Retail Federation (NRF). From hyper-personalised suggestions to curated inspiration, influence now begins long before a store visit or app tap, moving where brands and retailers compete to an entirely new level.

The study found that while nearly three-quarters of surveyed consumers (72 per cent) still shop in stores, almost half (45 per cent) turn to AI for help during their buying journeys. Shoppers still want to see and touch products, but today's savvy consumers increasingly arrive with a sense of what they're looking for and why. They are using AI to research products (41 per cent), interpret reviews (33 per cent), and hunt for deals (31 per cent).

""AI is changing how consumers shop, and every aspect throughout the shopping journey,"" noted Caroline Reppert, senior director, AI and Technology Policy at the National Retail Federation, ""As these technologies increasingly guide consumer discovery, comparison, and choice, retailers that understand and respond to this shift will be best positioned to earn trust, relevance, and long-term customer loyalty.""

Generative AI is reshaping early shopping decisions, with 45 per cent of consumers using AI for product research, reviews, and deal-hunting, as per an IBM–NRF study. While stores remain important, AI-driven discovery now guides choices before purchase. Brands must redesign journeys around AI moments, ensure data readiness, and invest in AI skills to stay competitive and build long-term trust.

For leading brands and retailers, this shift toward AI-shaped discovery is prompting a rethink of how and where they engage consumers. As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explained, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search. Consumers now rely on assistants that feel almost human, know their preferences, and offer neutral, best-for-me advice that reshapes how they validate and decide what to buy.""

While 35 per cent of surveyed consumers still desire visually appealing stores with no wait times, AI-powered solutions are nearly as important. In fact, one in three consumers seek super apps that combine commerce with other services, 30 per cent want smart homes with AI personal shoppers and autonomous delivery, and 29 per cent look for effortless purchasing through social platforms.

Consumers are growing increasingly accustomed to AI-powered shopping assistants helping them decide what to buy. That expectation, however, is forming faster than most retail operating models can keep pace, forcing the question: Is data ready to guide and validate what customers ultimately choose?

""AI is not a magic wand,"" emphasised Stanislas Vignon, head of insights (AI and omnichannel) at Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH). ""If you don't have the right data, it doesn't work. And you must test your solution to know whether it works and where it will bring value.""

As AI reshapes consumer decision-making, brands and retailers must redesign shopping journeys around future AI-driven moments, using agents to reduce uncertainty early through research, comparison, and personalised support. Strong data readiness and end-to-end testing are essential to overcome cross-channel challenges. Companies should leverage AI to scale relevance while preserving brand distinctiveness, and invest in AI skills and strategic partnerships to build expertise and deploy AI responsibly.

AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry. In retail, understanding AI-influenced consumer behaviour will become a defining competitive advantage, separating brands and retailers that shape decisions from those that simply fulfill them.

It also owns 17% of MPS, a holding worth 4.6 billion euros, and a 10.5% stake in Generali.","ROME/MILAN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has discussed potentially buying the stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) held by Delfin in contacts with the head of the Italian holding company, three people close to the matter told Reuters.

An investment in MPS could put UniCredit back in play in the consolidation reshaping Italian banking after last year's failed attempt to acquire Banco BPM, another smaller rival.

The sources said UniCredit had also weighed a potential direct investment in Delfin, the holding company of Italy's Del Vecchio family. Delfin declined to comment.

UniCredit is also interested in Delfin's stake in Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, one of the sources added.

UniCredit last year built a holding of nearly 7% in Generali as a financial investment, which it later cut to 2%. Orcel has said UniCredit ""is observing"" developments at Generali.

The outcome of the talks between Orcel and Delfin Chairman Francesco Milleri was not immediately clear.

Delfin belongs in equal parts to the eight heirs of the late billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio.

Orcel and Milleri have frequent contact for several reasons, two other people close to the matter separately said. Orcel sits on the board of the Fondazione Leonardo Del Vecchio charitable foundation and Delfin is a shareholder in UniCredit.

UniCredit still has capital in excess of targeted thresholds, after buying 26% of Germany's Commerzbank and 29.8% of Greece's Alpha Bank.

Orcel's M&A efforts have met resistance from the governments in both Rome and Berlin. UniCredit has blamed Italy for derailing the BPM deal.

Reuters reported in November that Italy's government still aimed to see through a long-held plan to combine MPS with BPM. Italy owns 4.9% of MPS after cutting a 68% stake it had acquired in a 2017 bailout.

Delfin's main asset is a 32% stake in eyewear group EssilorLuxottica. It also owns 17% of MPS, a holding worth 4.6 billion euros, and a 10.5% stake in Generali.

If it were to rise to $7 trillion in 2026, that would require the stock to rise by 56%. Any stock that rises that fast in a year is well worth an investment, and if Nvidia truly has a shot at becoming a $7 trillion company in 2026, it should be at the top of every investor's shopping list.

I think that Nvidia can achieve this lofty goal in 2026, but it will require a few things to happen. If these things transpire, I have no doubt that Nvidia will be a top stock to own for this year.

AI spending isn't slowing down

AI hyperscalers spent a record amount of money constructing data centers in 2025. All of them have informed investors that 2026 will see increased spending as well. That's a big deal for Nvidia, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard computing unit used to train and run artificial intelligence models.

Nvidia's GPUs are the best available, but so are the supporting components, like its controlling software and connecting infrastructure. This makes Nvidia the go-to company to outfit data centers, but there's an issue: Nvidia has sold out all of its cloud GPU capacity. Nvidia must work to increase its capacity to meet this unprecedented demand, and it has already taken several steps to maximize its output.

First, Nvidia plans to significantly reduce its gaming GPU output in 2026. That move will free up chips to be used in the more profitable and in-demand cloud GPUs. Second, Nvidia is pushing its chip supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, to increase its output. That will give Nvidia greater supply and allow it to increase production to meet the massive demand in the market for its chips.

I believe both of these items are achievable for 2026, which will enable Nvidia to maintain its rapid growth rate. For fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027), Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow its revenue by 50%. Analysts have consistently underestimated Nvidia's growth potential, so I wouldn't be surprised if the actual figure exceeds that. Furthermore, there's a somewhat unknown factor that could boost Nvidia's sales even further: China.

Nvidia appears poised to resume shipments of chip sales to China. According to Reuters, there is demand for about 2 million units, while Nvidia has about 700,000 H200 chips on hand. There could be even more demand if these initial shipments go well, and that could also boost Nvidia's growth rate this year.

All of this adds up to a company that could be worth $7 trillion if everything goes as planned for Nvidia.

A $7 trillion market cap won't be easy to achieve

For Nvidia to get to a $7 trillion market cap, we need to make a few assumptions:

Nvidia's profit margins maintain their current level.

Nvidia meets analysts' expectations of 50% growth.

Nvidia's valuation stays at its current level.

AI spending is projected to continue in 2027.

The average Wall Street analyst projects $320 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2027, at Nvidia's current 53% profit margin, which would equate to $170 billion in profits by the end of the fiscal year. Nvidia's current price-to-earnings ratio is 46, which is actually cheaper than it has been over the past few years.

With $320 billion in profits at a P/E ratio of 46, that would value the stock at $7.8 trillion.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850053%2Fperson-throwing-money-in-the-air.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-13 00:59:18.254484

Read more about the IBV study “Retail and Consumer Products in the AI Era”","Retailers operate in an environment where customer expectations rise faster than margins, leaving little room for hesitation regarding transformation. Artificial intelligence has quickly become one of the most powerful forces reshaping how the industry engages shoppers, designs products and runs its operations.

The latest IBM Institute for Business Value study, Retail and Consumer Products in the AI Era, reveals that the next two years will be especially pivotal.

The decisions retail leaders make about AI in 2026 and 2027 will influence not only competitive differentiation. They will also influence how effectively brands keep pace with customers who are integrating AI into their daily lives—using it to inform decisions, navigate choices and shape how and where they shop.

Customer expectations are shifting, and the industry now requires a clear, practical agenda for what comes next. Insights from the study highlight the areas where AI is already creating measurable impact and where retailers should focus their attention to unlock value.

A notable finding from the IBV study is the shift in where AI investment originates. By 2027, 35% of total AI expenses will sit outside the IT budget, up from 28% in 2025. Meanwhile, AI expense within IT budgets is also increasing—from just under 10% of annual IT budgets today to 13% in 2027.

This signals an important industry shift: AI has become a business decision, not just a technology one.

Merchandising teams are increasingly funding AI to enhance product discovery. Marketing teams are deploying AI to personalize content and offers. Supply chain leaders are applying AI to anticipate demand and manage exceptions. When investment flows out of traditional silos, it reflects a broader organizational shift toward operationalizing AI across the enterprise.

The study shows that 80% of retail and consumer products companies now have a long-term innovation strategy for AI. This move underscores that AI is no longer positioned as a side experiment but as a core engine for growth.

Looking toward 2026 and 2027, these investments represent a turning point. AI spending is moving beyond tool experimentation into a phase focused on building the capabilities required to compete in a market shaped by real-time decisions, sophisticated customer expectations and new forms of digital commerce.

Retailers have always relied on data to understand customers, yet much of that data remains underutilized. According to the IBV study, 64% of companies say that their proprietary data is accessible to AI, but only 49% of that data is usable. Moreover, just 26% is being used currently to train AI models.

This gap highlights a significant opportunity. Unlocking proprietary data is one of the most critical components of the 2026–2027 AI agenda because the performance of high‑value AI capabilities—whether in personalization, inventory optimization or forecasting—depends on data quality and accessibility.

Retail has an advantage: the industry has historically collected rich, high‑volume customer and transaction data. As data becomes cleaner, better governed and more connected, the downstream value of AI increases dramatically across experiences and operations.

Customers are already feeling the impact. 58% of executives say that AI improves customer retention and satisfaction, and over the past year, AI has contributed to an average 31% improvement in these areas. For an industry built on loyalty, those gains are significant.

AI’s role in retail is shifting from advisory to action-oriented. The IBV study shows that 84% of executives expect AI to significantly enhance their ability to respond rapidly to market disruptions and evolving customer needs. But the most transformative shift is not speed alone—it’s AI’s ability to take action on complex tasks.

Agentic and autonomous AI systems are already running multi-step workflows: coordinating inventory, personalizing offers and guiding customers through complex purchase decisions. According to the study, 76% of executives are transforming their business models to leverage AI not only for efficiency but also for new revenue streams.

This shift toward action-driven AI is expected to become one of the defining characteristics of retail transformation over the next two years. Organizations that build the foundation for agentic AI in 2026 will be better positioned to elevate experiences and capture new value by 2027.

A compelling example comes from Al Futtaim Group, whose AI-powered Blue app integrates loyalty, payments and shopping into a unified journey. Customers earn and redeem across categories instantly, browse frictionlessly and complete transactions in a single flow—demonstrating the impact of AI-led orchestration paired with human oversight.

The study makes clear that AI augments rather than replaces human roles. AI agents increasingly take on repetitive, multi-step processes across the value chain—linking inventory, payments, logistics and customer data—while employees step in where judgment, empathy and brand trust are essential.

This model frees associates and service teams to focus on higher-value interactions and complex customer needs. Executives report that AI is delivering the most value in marketing, customer service, supply chain operations and digital commerce—areas where operational precision and human connection intersect.

The result is a hybrid operating model where AI manages the complexity, and people amplify what makes retail distinctively human.

The study also highlights the growing importance of ecosystems. AI can have a transformative impact only when tools, partners, platforms and agents work together securely and seamlessly. Autonomous AI cannot reach its potential within fragmented systems.

To prepare for this shift, retailers will need to modernize commerce platforms, redesign processes for non-linear customer journeys and strengthen data governance. When AI systems can understand and act across the full business, retailers can orchestrate experiences holistically rather than in isolated touchpoints.

This is why ecosystem integration sits at the center of the 2026–2027 AI agenda. The future belongs to retailers who can coordinate intelligence across the value chain, not just within individual functions.

Insights from the IBV study point to three areas where retail leaders can focus to accelerate progress:

Use AI to deliver permissioned, hyper-personalized experiences

Tailor journeys through secure customer data, deploy AI in high-impact processes like order-to-cash and supply chain orchestration and ensure that AI tools reflect your brand truth—even when customers interact through external AI assistants.

Enable conversational commerce and automate key tasks with AI

Make your product information discoverable and AI-friendly. Start automating repetitive operational tasks, then expand AI’s role as you establish trust—for both your customers and your teams.

Orchestrate collaboration between AI agents and across ecosystems

Break down silos. Connect business systems. Let AI agents coordinate work across functions. Ensure that AI-driven recommendations and transactions remain secure, accurate and aligned to your brand values.

In retail, every click, cart and conversation carries weight—and AI is amplifying the best of what makes the industry human. Over the next two years, the gap will widen between retailers that use AI to fundamentally rethink how they operate and those retailers that see it as just another layer of technology.

The defining difference will come down to clear decisions about data foundations, operating models and where AI is trusted to act. Strengthening these foundations now will shape the next era of retail performance.

The opportunity ahead is significant—and very real. Retailers who act with intent today will help define what “good” looks like tomorrow. Those retailers who wait might find the pace has already been set for them.

The Turkish denim manufacturer teamed with Karachi, Pakistan-based SM Denim to launch BodyCast, a resin-based finish that’s applied to garments mounted on life-like mannequins. The purpose of this setup is to mirror the human lower body, allowing whiskers, thigh rolls, pocket bite, and honeycombs to form naturally.

The process celebrates how, for more than 150 years, denim has been defined by how it responds to the body—creasing at stress points, fading with friction, and developing character over time, Rimaks stated. Rather than finishing denim on a flat bench and relying on aggressive abrasion or artificial distressing, the process creates three-dimensional wear mapping that feels intuitive, lived-in, and personal to the wearer.

This “new generation” resin is activated under lower temperatures and it does not contain formaldehyte. However, it is not more expensive than the resin treatment. Though it takes longer than the standard resin application, the process can be applied at scale.

“We cast denim on the body,” said Meir Barbut, Board Member at Rimaks. “BodyCast allows us to recreate the way denim truly wears—naturally, honestly, and with depth—while giving brands full control over the final expression.”

The result is a balance of whisker depth, comb intensity and subtle sheen that enhances texture without overpowering the fabric. Finishes can also be adjusted by fit, meaning the process can be applied to the wide variety of jeans in the market like tapered, straight, wide or barrel.

Additionally, Rimaks notes how BodyCast allows garments to “age gracefully.” By eliminating heavy abrasion, jeans are less lightly to breakdown prematurely.

Rimaks aims to take a lead in innovating denim wash and finishing techniques. Last summer, the company partnered with DNM Denim to introduce Nova, a four-step finishing platform that utilizes laser abrasion, ozone-enhanced bleaching, eco-stoning and advanced eco-chemistry.

Fabrics finished with BodyCast will be presented by SM Denim later this month at Denim & Jeans Egypy and Kingpins New York. The fabrics are part of the mill’s Icons collection, which focuses on timeless constructions and indigo shades that tap into the demand for both heritage and modern denim.

“Icons was created as a tribute to denim purists,” adds Junaid Javed, SM Denim executive chairman. “With BodyCast, those fabrics come alive in a way that feels both timeless and relevant.”

Article content

Copper has long been studied by economists as a barometer for what’s happening in the wider economy because of its versatility and ubiquity.

Article content

But Yergin said copper, which is essential for the generation, transmission and use of electricity, is in the midst of a demand explosion. That’s evident in the multibillion-dollar data centres sprouting up to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the fleets of new electric vehicles hitting the roads, which continue to grow rapidly though not as quickly in North America as elsewhere, and the growth of renewable energy installations, among other things.

Article content

Already, copper supplies, about 85 per cent of which come from mines, cannot keep up with the rising demand, he said.

Article content

Fortunately, the current shortage is minimal. Annual demand represents about 28 million tonnes per year, and mine production and recycling produce about 27 million tonnes per year. The difference has been filled in by whatever existing stockpiles are around.

Article content

But that won’t last much longer because copper demand is skyrocketing, Yergin said, something he and a team of commodity analysts, data centre experts, former diplomats and others at research firm S&P Global Inc. laid out in a 110-page report released last week.

It builds on a similar report about copper that Yergin released in mid-2022, but a few months after that report, he said he realized “the world had changed” for copper demand when he arrived at the annual energy conference he founded in Texas and noticed groups of tech executives milling around.

PS Community Hub breaks away from traditional retail apps or loyalty programs by uniting social, commerce, and culture into a single co-creation platform. The hub offers creators tools for content publishing, personal brand building, and monetization through affiliate commissions.

Additionally, it provides a growth path to help creators increase their exposure, unlock new opportunities, and give top users the chance to co-create capsule collections, Pacsun stated.

Through PS Community Hub, the retailer’s goal is to bridge “digital community engagement with real-world product creation” while continuing to drive authentic content that resonates with consumers.

“The creation of PS Community Hub demonstrates Pacsun’s purpose-driven retail strategy, putting creators and our youth community at the heart of our plan to fuel sustainable growth, cultural relevance, and innovation in retail,” said Pacsun CEO Brieane Olson. “Our deep generational listening and Insights from the Pacsun Youth Report have been instrumental in shaping this initiative, ensuring that we address the evolving needs and aspirations of our young consumers and remain at the forefront of technology and social commerce.”

Everyday consumers can contribute to the hub as well. Pacsun said they can collaborate, share content, participate in immersive experiences, and engage with like-minded peers, all while enjoying social shopping experiences that convert engagement into sales.

AI will be applied to content review, personalization, customer service and analytics.

Shirley Gao, Pacsun chief digital and information officer, said PS Community Hub represents a bold step forward in business innovation.

“By harnessing AI, advanced algorithms, and cloud-native technologies, we are building a next-generation mobile platform designed specifically for Pacsun’s Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers, the most digitally fluent generations to date,” she said.

While young consumers have long relied on print magazines, blogs, Tumblr, Pinterest, and other opinion-driven platforms for fashion content, Gao highlighted how the app offers a more immersive ecosystem, where consumers, creators and brands can share authentic perspectives on fashion and lifestyle, and actively co-create what they want rather than being told what to wear.

Earnings Watch: JPMorgan and Delta start off the fourth-quarter earnings season amid high expectations, a more expensive market and questions about the Fed's independence

JPMorgan Chase reports quarterly results on Tuesday.

When Delta Air Lines Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. kick off fourth-quarter earnings this week, we'll get the first look at whether corporate America's enthusiasm matches up with that of investors, amid worries about the job market and deeper questions about the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy independently.

For the fourth quarter, at least, Wall Street still expects another round of solid results for the companies in the S&P 500 Index.

In a report on Friday, FactSet forecast earnings-per-share growth of 8.3% for the fourth quarter. That's below the average over the past five years, but it would still mark the 10th quarter of consecutive growth. Profit margins, meanwhile, are expected to stay strong, at 12.8%.

That report said analysts nudged their estimates higher for those results during the quarter - a sign of optimism, and something they don't normally do - even as concerns endured about higher prices, tariffs and the impact of the longest-ever government shutdown. The tech sector helped drive that confidence, despite enduring questions over stratospheric spending on artificial intelligence.

But as expectations stay high, stocks have gotten expensive. The S&P 500, as of last week, had been trading at more than 20 times estimated earnings.

""It'll be very hard to justify stocks and stock-market investors being positive and optimistic if the outlook for the companies is softening or not improving,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, said in an interview.

Investors rode into 2026 hopeful that a cocktail of lower interest rates, tax breaks, easing inflation and tariff clarity would loosen up consumer spending. But the fourth-quarter results - and the more-important financial forecasts that will accompany them - will follow a December jobs report that showed signs of a still-weak but firming labor market, and a Justice Department criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over whether he lied to Congress about cost overruns for renovations to the central bank's headquarters, which Powell and others have cast as a pretext for an attack on the Fed's independence.

Stocks on Monday appeared unfazed by the investigation, at least for now. But JPMorgan (JPM) and the other banks could field questions about the state of the Fed on calls with reporters and analysts, amid broader pressure by President Donald Trump to get Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively.

""As the long-term outlook goes, the independence of the Fed is extremely relevant, and we have plentiful evidence that monetary policy driven by politics tends to end up with inflationary results,"" Giuseppe Sette, president of the AI-driven analytics firm Reflexivity, said in a email.

""However, the short term might be more resilient,"" he continued. ""We've seen the market effectively shake off Ukraine for a longer while. We've seen it shake off Venezuela. We've seen it shake off Iran and even the Greenland discussions.""

Markets are also still waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of Trump's emergency-powers tariffs, after justices held off on a ruling on Friday. Nancy Tengler, the chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments, said she'd want to know how the companies reporting in the weeks ahead might rework their production and supply chains if the court ruled against the government.

However, the Trump administration has other ways to place duties on imports. And she said that many companies had already largely rerouted their production and shipping infrastructure, or made other adjustments, to account for the higher import taxes.

""You may see some pops in better-than-expected guidance,"" she said, referring to the financial outlooks companies provide during quarterly earnings. ""But I just don't think it's going to amount to much.""

Heading into the results, some Wall Street analysts were hopeful that Trump's so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" legislation - which cut taxes but also cut or slapped restrictions on some public assistance - might give consumers fatter tax refunds or otherwise jolt spending, helping chains like Walmart Inc. (WMT) and brands like Nike Inc. (NKE).

Lower interest rates and less-aggressive price increases could also help, as companies run out of room to charge more without putting a bigger dent in demand. However, analysts said wealthier consumers would likely benefit more from any policy changes or easing borrowing and living costs.

""The K-shaped economy that everybody keeps talking about is certainly still intact,"" Eric Clark, chief investment officer at Accuvest Global Advisors, said in emailed comments. ""The upper part of the K, the higher income, with real assets and homes, they're doing pretty well, and they're spending really well. The small part, the lower-income cohorts, are struggling, because inflation is still present in a lot of parts of our lives.""

""Retail sales have been strong, but it's not been broad,"" he continued. ""Consumers are being very choiceful. They're asking, 'Is this item an interesting item? If it's discretionary, do I love it?'""

As more companies report, Tengler said she'd also be watching for remarks about spending and hiring plans. Those details would come amid the current inertia of the ""no hire, no fire"" job market, and as analysts watch for the impacts of AI on headcount.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, also said he'd be watching for hiring trends.

""A lot of companies were able to get away with keeping employment high, keeping their payrolls up, because they were able to raise prices and offset some of that increased cost in employment,"" he said.

""I don't think that they're going to have that ability to do that going forward,"" he added later. ""I think inflation has come down quite a bit.""

JPMorgan (JPM) and Delta (DAL) report on Tuesday. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also report during the week.

Expectations for the banks are higher, as regulators back away from the industry. Analysts were upbeat about dealmaking, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions and IPOs.

However, Mian, at Zacks, said higher interest rates and concerns about the economy had weighed on loan demand. Credit quality could be another focus. But he said concerns about credit quality and delinquencies had leveled off.

Delta, meanwhile, reports in the wake of what Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham called a ""lost year"" for the airlines, punctuated by the government shutdown. But Delta's push toward wealthier fliers has been a plus for the carrier's sales.

""Not all airlines were able to take on a challenging environment and minimize downside to estimates, but Delta and United managed the best, while others struggled,"" Cunningham said in a note last week.

The Big Tech companies that report in the weeks ahead - like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) - will face concerns about financing for the AI infrastructure buildout, which has driven up energy costs, and circular deal-making. But Tengler said that for investors, there are still few places to find growth.

""We keep hearing that the tech trade is dead,"" Tengler said. ""I've been keeping track: We've heard it every summer since 2022, and yet that's where all the growth has come in, not just in the economy and the capex side of things, but in stock-price performance.""

She added: ""We're still seeing a big, huge spread between technology earnings growth and the rest of the market.""

Johnson & Johnson has reached an agreement with the Trump administration tied to its ongoing $55 billion U.S.-based investment plan, reinforcing the company’s commitment to domestic manufacturing, R&D, and job creation. The move reflects broader industry efforts to align capital deployment with evolving federal priorities around supply chain resilience.

At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Bristol Myers Squibb outlined how it is positioning the company for the next decade, emphasizing disciplined capital allocation, late-stage pipeline execution, and strategic business development. Leadership highlighted a focus on durable growth drivers across oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease.

Pfizer also used the JPMorgan stage to detail its post-COVID pivot, stressing a sharper emphasis on operational execution and pipeline productivity. The company acknowledged near-term revenue pressure from declining pandemic-related products while reaffirming confidence in its long-term innovation strategy.

Instrument: A means to capture data (i.e., a questionnaire) plus all the information and documentation that supports its use. Generally, that includes clearly defined methods and instructions for administration or responding, a standard format for data collection, and well documented methods for scoring, analysis, and interpretation of results in the target patient population.

*in this article, COA is used synonymously with questionnaire

The licensing and translations process for clinical outcome assessment (COA) measures is notorious for being a major pain point in clinical trial set-up, and is often a significant resource burden, from both a time and cost perspective. But this is not a new concern—as an industry, we have been talking for decades about how much of a source of friction this process can be.

All stakeholders—copyright holders, sponsors, CROs, eCOA providers—should strongly endorse the importance of removing barriers in the drug development process and getting treatments to patients faster. So, why are we still encountering the same issues, and what roadblocks (or incentives) are driving the unacceptable status quo and how can they be solved?

Licensing

The following details common problems encountered during the licensing process that present a risk to study go-live, along with proposed solutions. Furthermore, when—as it so often is—eCOA set-up and implementation is on the critical path to first patient in (FPI) (See Figure 1), these issues can be exacerbated.

Problem: Who is the copyright holder?

Identification of copyright ownership of a COA can sometimes be challenging; research to ascertain this can take time, often requiring contact to be made with several entities, or a trawl through the literature.

Solution: At COA conception (such as during the funding process), developers should ensure a clearly documented path to its use, detailing agreed arrangements for its long-term management—including who will own the copyright, its licensing process, and user support. This is especially pertinent in cases of academically developed measures, where contact information is often only included in a publication, which can become out-of-date if the author has changed institution or retired. Journals that publish findings from COA development should also ensure that clear information on how to obtain permission (if any) for the COA(s) use are available.

Problem: When will the copyright holder respond?

Some copyright holders take weeks to respond to a license request and require much chasing throughout the process.

Solution: Copyright holders should have a duty of care to provide clearly stated response times, ideally along with a clear description of the process required to secure permissions for the COA(s) use (e.g., on their website, or via an automated email response detailing this). When considering the appropriate timeline for response, being cognizant of the fact that COA licensing and eCOA implementation is often on the critical path to FPI, is encouraged. More detailed information would also likely reduce the number of enquires received. If a COA developer does not have the resource or expertise to manage this activity, engaging a COA management organization is recommended.

Problem: What will the license include?

Certain COAs have additional materials that can be licensed (which are not included as standard), and the availability of such materials is not always made clear from the outset. It would be fair to assume that the license would include access to all the available support documentation under the FDAs definition of an instrument1 (Box 1); however, this is not always the case. Furthermore, the cost and timeline implications associated with licensing these elements are not always made clear upfront and can lead to delays and unforeseen (hidden) costs.

Solution: Copyright holders should provide clear information upfront on exactly what a standard license includes and available additions, to enable informed decisions about buying their products. Provision of a minimal package as standard is encouraged, in line with the FDA’s definition of an instrument,1 including:

The Licensed COA

Scoring information, and any associated analytics software

Any administration instructions

Additional elements to facilitate electronic implementation may include:

Direction to adhere to industry best practices for electronic implementation2 or specific copyright holder requirements (especially when they deviate from established best practices)2

Documented process for eCOA reproductions, including any review requirements (e.g., screenshot approval), associated costs, and estimated timelines (e.g., number of rounds of review included and turn-around-times)

Problem: What parameters are required for pricing?

Standardization and consistency in COA pricing models are lacking and can be based on a range of parameters, such as number of sites, participants, administrations, or trial length. As some of these parameters may not be finalized at the point of license initiation (e.g., site selection is ongoing, regulatory bodies may not have approved the protocol), the process can be delayed or will require subsequent license amendments, which is an additional administrative task and potential cost.

Solution: Clear upfront information from copyright holders about pricing parameters for a given COA so licensees can confidently forecast potential licensing costs.

Problem: How long will contract review take?

Licenses of copyright are legally binding contracts that can require review from several different stakeholders (including the CRO, sponsor, eCOA provider, and/or training provider) which can take time. Further, when a study is going to use eCOA, some copyright holders require that this is specified when requesting the license and included in the agreement. When eCOA provider selection is on the critical path to FPI, this can delay licensing initiation and execution.

Solution: In the absence of a standard licensing template used by all copyright holders, at the very least, a commitment to turn around reviews in a specific time is needed.

Problem: When will the COA be provided?

Often, a copy of the COA is not provided until license execution and payment. Not having access to an official copy of the COA prior to this can negatively impact:

Protocol development

Sponsors cannot review and evaluate the appropriateness of individual items and the measure in its entirety, to determine if it is suitable for a given trial application

eCOA technical feasibility assessment:

eCOA providers are unable to ensure their system has the required functionality to build the most optimal electronic version of the COA

eCOA build:

The license has often not been executed and paid for at the time of commencing eCOA build activities—especially where the eCOA provider is contracted for scale management

As contracting and kicking off eCOA services is often on the critical path to FPI, not having access to the COA(s) to create eCOA specifications and the build presents a major risk to study go-live

Invoice terms are usually Net 30 days (and can be greater), and so expediting normal payment terms is required

Ultimately, it runs the risk that some may obtain a copy of the COA from an unreliable (non-official, possibly adulterated) source, to try and assess the suitability of the COA and meet eCOA build timelines.

Solution: Providing an official copy of the COA (including watermarked sample copy or if developed electronically, access to the items) prior to the execution of the license and payment, would significantly benefit the clinical trial set-up process, and reduce the impact of many of the detailed issues. It would be on the strict understanding that it should not be used in a live study until license execution and payment. The license, in this scenario, is for the actual use of the COA (i.e., for completion within a study). With most things in life that we buy, we can review and assess it prior to purchase—whereas what we see for COA licensing is often buying blind.

Alternatively, a limited rights license (that is quick to execute) could be provided to allow for review and/or eCOA build, enabling eCOA providers to reproduce the COA electronically and make reasonable preparations for study use.

Screenshots

Problem: Generating screenshots imminently after eCOA project initiation.

If sponsors request screenshots for ethics committee (EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) submissions (though they are not necessarily required),3,4 this can create a huge challenge and pressure on eCOA providers to generate these in the time required; especially when the COA is not provided until license execution and payment.

This could become more challenging with the new EU-CTR submissions process requiring a single submission for all EU member states, and the perception that all translated screenshots may be requested by individual health authorities. If copyright holders must approve the screenshots prior to this, further delays can be seen.

Some copyright holders also require live demo review, which can add further time to receiving implementation approval.

Solution: A clear public statement from IRBs/ECs that eCOA screenshots are not required and the paper COA is sufficient.

Translations

Another challenge faced during licensing is the associated translation activities, which present differently dependent on if the required translations already exist or not. For example, it is not always clear what translations are available, the methodology employed (leading to a lack of confidence in faithful translation), and so translations are often repeated, which can lead to variation and confusion.

Copyright holders (or a delegated management organization) should have a duty of care to maintain a published translation database with this information (e.g., on a website)—that is recognized as the only source of official translations—with updates as new ones are added, and on details on access.

If the copyright holder requires approval of eCOA screenshots for every language implemented in a study this takes a significant amount of time, and is a major risk if a sponsor wishes to go live in languages other than a routinely used language (e.g., US English). Copyright holders are encouraged to be mindful of this when requiring approval of all translated eCOA reproductions, or at least sensitive to their impact on timelines when working with stakeholders such as sponsors, eCOA providers and or language service providers.

Are eCOA libraries the answer?

In short, no. At least not based on the current model, and until there is a more cost-effective model for libraries, they are unlikely to have the utility they promise.

Licensing and translations fees are either paid directly, or are passthrough costs, by the sponsor. In the current library model, the eCOA provider must pay the library license fee. For smaller organizations, and especially when projected use can be unclear (i.e., there is no guarantee of recuperation)—it is risky to front-up what can be a substantial amount of money—sometimes in the millions.

Further, sponsors are still required to pay the licensing fee for the actual use of the COA in a study, so the eCOA provider also must develop a costing model that recoups the upfront cost of the library license, which can be especially challenging where sponsors expect cost savings/reductions from using COAs from the eCOA providers library. Sponsors often very reasonably question that if the eCOA is already built, why should they pay the same price for it again. The library model also saves the copyright holder time and resource as they are not repeatedly reviewing screenshots, and yet they are charging extra for a library license, which as mentioned can be substantial.

An alternative model sees approval obtained by the eCOA provider for their build, and then the copyright holder being notified of a new study wanting to use it, so they can confirm it is the approved build. They would still receive the same licensing fees from the sponsor and not have to review implementations repeatedly.

Conclusion

The challenges outlined are well understood, not insurmountable, and entirely solvable. The current approach and relationship between eCOA providers, copyright holders, and sponsors/CROs remains overly transactional, and it is time to move beyond inertia and adopt practical, collective solutions. A committed effort from all stakeholders is required to address the aspects within their control, and the efficiencies to be gained from relatively simple changes to the processes implemented by many copyright holders are not insignificant by any means. Additionally, sponsors engaging copyright holders and eCOA providers earlier (and off the critical path to FPI) would also mitigate some of the challenges described. By doing so, we can move past these recurring problems and focus our energy on more meaningful goals, such as truly optimizing the user experience of digital technologies and speeding up drug development.

Copyright holders who have adopted many of the solutions outlined above, demonstrate a genuine intention and commitment to find ways to remove delays in getting effective treatments to those in need whilst rightly protecting their intellectual property and the integrity of the COA. Mitigating against improper use of COAs that could bring into question the integrity of the specific use of the COA is critical, and the solutions outlined in this article would not bring that into question The payment and contractual requirements would still be adhered to, and the burden felt by sponsors, CROs, and eCOA providers, would be greatly reduced.

Business Insider will keep tracking this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.","Are AI giants nurturing the web, the most valuable store of human data the world will ever see? Or are they scraping content for free and giving little back? Updated data from Cloudflare sheds new light on this important question.

This is one of the most under-discussed parts of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.

That's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.

In the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.

In the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created and verified the data in the first place.

Cloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, began tracking this behavior in 2025. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.

This crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.

Is this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in January.

As you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web. Anthropic actually crawled even more in early January, compared to the first week of September 2025, according to this data.

The same applies to OpenAI; its crawl-to-refer ratio has worsened. Again, this suggests that OpenAI is taking more value from the web and giving less value back.

This aligns with Business Insider reporting from late 2024. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.

One web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting.

So, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.

Like last quarter, I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Back in September, Anthropic said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be ""issues"" with the methodology. At that time, Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. This was generating more referral traffic for websites now, and this is growing quickly, the startup said back then.

OpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.

A caveat: The numbers that go into the crawl-to-refer ratio focus on the web and exclude native app activity. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. However, this methodology applies to all the companies included in this ranking.

Google's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows clear website links in many results. However, the company is increasingly weaving in AI chatbot-style answers into its search service, via AI Overviews and AI mode.

Google has been saying lately that it still sends traffic to the web, and it cares about the health of this ecosystem.

Walmart is slated to join the Nasdaq 100, an index known for tracking tech stock, on Jan. 20, Nasdaq said.

The planned move comes as Walmart executives have focused on the retailer's e-commerce platform and novel AI tools.

Walmart is getting the recognition it’s been seeking for its e-commerce prowess.

The retail giant will move to the Nasdaq 100—an index tracking the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq —before the market opens on Jan. 20, the exchange operator said Friday. Walmart (WMT) has spent months highlighting its marketplace and delivery services, fueling speculation that it was eyeing the list seen as a tech-sector bellwether.

Walmart will replace pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca (AZN). The move comes about a month after Walmart left the New York Stock Exchange for the Nasdaq, which is home to tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).

Why This News Matters to Investors

Consumer-focused companies from Target to Wingstop have touted their embrace of AI as investors pour money in the technology. Walmart has successfully convinced investors that it's part tech stock, part retailer, and a pending move to the Nasdaq 100 index should bolster that.

The Nasdaq is a better fit for Walmart’s tech-centric approach, company executives have said. The retailer’s business no longer centers around a portfolio of big-box stores, they said, highlighting its booming delivery service, automated fulfillment centers and third-party marketplace.

“The results we're delivering today are powered by our people and by technology,” CEO Douglas McMillon told investors on a November conference call, according to a transcript from AlphaSense. “We continue to get better at putting our data to work, building more capable tech products, and platforms, and by deploying physical automation.”

McMillon highlighted the “digital acumen” of John Furner, head of Walmart U.S., when announcing in November that Furner will succeed him. Furner will lead the company through an “AI-driven transformation,” McMillon said.

Walmart is using AI to interact with consumers in new ways, including pinging customers on WhatsApp to ask if they want to stock up with a basket of frequently-ordered staples. It announced Sunday that it is working with Google to ensure people can easily find and purchase Walmart products when chatting in Gemini, Google’s AI-powered chat service.

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

But is this enough to raise its disappointing sales performance, especially at a time when the consumer expresses more value-oriented behaviors?

The company’s recent net sales ended 1.5% lower than 2024, a thorn in the side of investors who’ve lamented the retailer’s steady stock decline since its November 2021 peak. Even in the past year, the stock price has fallen by roughly 21.5% as of Jan. 8. Nevertheless, the recent announcement inspired a more local bump, accounting for a 10% spike YTD, indicating support for the retailer’s value play.

On the other hand, competitors Walmart and Amazon continue to capture incremental growth while the chain struggles, despite playing in similar spaces. Walmart also recently debuted a deeper investment in personal healthcare, slashing the price of more than 1,000 wellness items, similar to what Target did in November, albeit more concentrated on the specific assortment.

Target’s latest wellness push is part of a longer-term strategy. Last January, the retail giant expanded its wellness assortment with 2,000 items, with a focus on lower-priced items ($10 or less).

Both expansion announcements emphasize F&B’s stake in the segment, with notable recent additions such as ButcherBox’s retail debut of grass-fed beef; protein snacks and powders from Misfits, David, and Bloom; functional and non-alcoholic beverages from Ryze, Protein Pop, and Naked Life, and gut health support from The Coconut Cult and Seed.

“About 70% of guests are already shopping wellness at Target and right in time for the new year, we’re bringing them even more newness and value,” said Lisa Roath, EVP and chief merchandising officer of food, essentials and beauty at Target, in a statement.

David and Goliath: Taking on Whole Foods (+ Amazon)

The shift towards wellness blurs the lines between hypermarket and natural grocer: Target wants a stellar, premium suite of better-for-you products while still out-pricing the legacy leader, Whole Foods.

This competition is a play for the “better-for-you” shopper, a segment that dominates Amazon brands’ shopper base. To target these consumers, the hypermarket chain is challenging Whole Food’s “aspirational” wellness stigma by positing their healthy assortment as an everyday luxury. The move also carefully navigates the line between Walmart’s hyper-value niche and Amazon’s online, pantry-stocking endeavor.

“Our goal is to make wellness really accessible – fun, easy, affordable and personalized,” Roath said.

In recent months, Whole Foods has worked to separate itself from the premium-priced stigma, which, if successful, would complicate Target’s value proposition. In a conversation at Groceryshop, Whole Foods chief merchandising and marketing officer Sonya Gafsi Oblisk noted that the company is innovating with the value-oriented modern shopper in mind.

“We want our shoppers to walk in and see a sea of yellow,” she said, referring to the sale signs that indicate deep discounts across the grocer’s assortment.

Today’s consumer is focused on shopping deals and reducing food budgets. If Target can capture these shoppers who feel priced out of Whole Food’s premium space, it can secure a path toward growth that can return net sales to the green.

Zooming out, Target’s supply chain operations are aligning with Walmart and Amazon’s model to more adequately compete on online grocery, the most optimistic growth driver with consistent double-digit year-over-year gains.

In December, the chain expanded its next-day delivery capabilities with a “stores-as-hubs” model that allows brick-and-mortar locations to operate as sortation centers. As Target improves service for same-day and next-day delivery, Amazon is pushing the envelope, piloting ultrafast delivery (sub 30 minutes) in Seattle and Philadelphia.

Nick Edser

Shares in banks and credit card firms have fallen after US President Donald Trump called for credit card costs to be capped.

On Friday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that interest rates on cards should be limited to 10% for one year from 20 January.

He did not specify how such a cap might be introduced or whether such a move would be legally enforceable.

Shares in US credit card firms American Express, Visa and Mastercard fell in early trading, while shares in the UK bank Barclays, which has a sizeable US card business, were down 1.9% at close of trading in London.

US banking associations say capping rates will make it harder for people to access credit and be ""devastating"" for millions of families and small businesses.

The average interest rate for credit cards in the US is roughly 20%.

In his statement on social media, Trump called for limiting it to 10%, reviving an idea he had put forward during his 2024 presidential campaign.

""Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,"" he wrote. ""Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.""

On Sunday, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said credit card companies would be ""in violation of the law"" if they did not comply with his demands.

American Express's share price initially fell by 4% while Visa and Mastercard's stock dropped more than 2%. Other US lenders including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America also saw their shares open more than 1% lower.

Forcing companies to lower their lending rates rate would ""upend the basic economics of the industry,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

""Most banks would respond by cutting credit limits, closing riskier accounts, and scaling back rewards programmes, because they simply couldn't cover losses at that price point.""

Nearly half of US households in 2022 carried credit card debt, according to the most recent survey of consumer finances by the Federal Reserve.

It found that those with a balance owed more than $6,000 (£4,454) on average - which, with interest rates around 20%, translated into roughly $100 in monthly charges.

The idea of capping credit card rates has won support from an unlikely coalition of lawmakers, uniting those on the far-left, such as Bernie Sanders, with populists that back Trump's MAGA agenda.

But the path to bringing the proposal into force is unclear.

Similar plans have languished in Congress. The administration has also pushed to reduce the role of agencies that have regulated such issues in the past.

""Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke,"" Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X.

""I said a year ago if Trump was serious I'd work to pass a bill to cap rates. Since then, he's done nothing but try to shut down the CFPB [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]"".

Analysts said executive action by the White House would likely meet with legal challenge from the industry, which has had success in the past fighting regulation in the courts.

A joint statement from five US banking bodies said they shared the president's goal ""of helping Americans access more affordable credit"".

However, they added that the proposed cap would ""reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small businesses who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help"".

""If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.""

Early last year, Sanders and fellow US senator Josh Hawley had introduced bipartisan legislation which aimed to cap interest rates on credit cards at 10% for five years, but it has yet to make it into law.

In April 2025, the Trump administration moved to throw out a regulation capping credit card late fees at $8. The rule had been brought in by President Joe Biden's administration as part of a crackdown on ""junk fees"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5db9/live/491fe3a0-efae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png,N,,2026-01-12 18:02:07.969373

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.
Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee.
According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.","NEW YORK(AP) — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

BioAge stock jumped more than 14% to 16.01. Shares have climbed nearly 500% from a low point below 3 last seen in April. Today, BioAge shares hold a perfect IBD Digital Relative Strength Rating of 99, reflecting their top-notch 12-month performance.

The company is working on a drug that blocks NLRP3. BioAge tested its drug in patients with obesity and elevated hsCRP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. High levels of hsCRP indicate inflammation in the body, signaling a high risk of metabolic conditions like heart disease, stroke or diabetes.

After two weeks, patients given BioAge's BGE-102 showed an 86% reduction in hsCRP. More than nine in 10 patients, 93%, achieved normal levels of the problematic protein. BGE-102 also reduced IL-6, another protein that can drive inflammation and cardiovascular risk.

BioAge is now planning to start a Phase 2a study in the first half of the year.

Can BioAge Rival Ventyx?

The update puts BioAge Labs in competition with Ventyx, which Lilly is buying for $1.2 billion. Ventyx has a drug that blocks NLRP3 to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Neumora (NMRA) and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) also have NLRP3 blockers in development.

""We are very encouraged by these results, which support the potential for BGE-102 to deliver injectable-like inflammation reduction in an oral therapy designed for primary care, the clinical setting where most cardiovascular risk is managed and where oral medicines are preferred by patients and physicians,"" BioAge Chief Executive Kristen Fortney said in a written statement.

She noted chronic inflammation is now recognized as a major driver of cardiovascular disease. But it's far less treated than high LDL cholesterol, a well-known and treated condition that can raise the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.

Mike Wallace’s Gotham at War offers a guidebook to a half-vanished city, and brings to life the immense human drama that unfolded in New York during the Second World War.

Gotham at War: A History of New York City from 1933 to 1945

by Mike Wallace

Oxford University Press, 2025, 976 pp.

Nearly three decades have passed since the historian Mike Wallace published Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898, cowritten with the late Edwin G. Burrows, to much renown. A second volume, Greater Gotham: A History of New York City from 1898 to 1919 (written by Wallace alone), followed in 2017. With the publication of the third and final installment in this panoramic history, Gotham at War: A History of New York City from 1933 to 1945, it is possible both to view the project as a whole and to look afresh at one of the most transformative eras in the history of New York, the United States, and the world.

There are roughly three faces of New York that run through Gotham at War. The first is the city as a connector—a “critical interlink,” Wallace writes, “between Europe and all of the Americas.” The second is New York as a generator, a source of ideas, forces, people, and products that shaped the country and the world. By playing these roles, New York affected the course of the Second World War; in turn, the war remade New York in ways both obvious and subtle.

A third New York appears early on in the narrative, though it is not until some 400 pages later that one of Gotham at War’s many characters describes it. This man, a young French sociologist recently installed at the New School, spends his days tutoring himself in the ethnology of Latin America at the 42nd Street branch of the New York Public Library. In the afternoons, when he is not writing, he walks the city. “What really amazed [Claude] Lévi-Strauss,” Wallace writes, “was that it seemed all of humanity’s cultures were on display in the astonishingly heterogeneous wartime city.” Lévi-Strauss had worried that industrial society would erase the local particularities of which culture was made. Yet in New York he found not an “ultramodern metropolis” but rather an “aggregation of villages”—a “vast collection,” Wallace writes, “of remnants and survivals from many continents and different eras, a palette of cultural sensibilities, an anthropologist’s dream.”

City as connector, city as generator, city of villages—these are the guises New York assumes not only in Gotham at War, but throughout the thousands of pages of the Gotham series. Inspired by the efflorescence of social history in the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace (with Burrows) originally set out to write a new narrative of all of American history, telling the story from the bottom up, with particular attention to the dynamics of capitalism and empire. Practical considerations eventually interceded, and the authors decided instead to refract their new history of the United States “through the prism of its preeminent city.” Like its pr...",https://dissentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/williams2026fb.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 14:06:53.565605

Burial will follow at Holy Souls Cemetery, Robinson Township.","Walter J. Baker, M.D., of Robinson Township, passed peacefully at home on January 10th, 2026. His caring and steadfast presence touched so many lives in the Pittsburgh community. He was a devoted family man, a proud physician, a devout Catholic, and an outdoor enthusiast.

Walter was born in Crafton, PA to Sylvester and Gertrude Baker on April 1, 1927. He and his six siblings were active at St. Philips Church and in their community, and helped out at the family business, the Seven Baker Brothers Bakery. As a youth, Walt developed a strong work ethic and deep Catholic values, which he continued to practice and model throughout his 98 years of life.

Walter was both a World War II and Korean War veteran, enlisting in the Navy after graduating from Langley High School in 1945, and then serving in the Air Force during the Korean War. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1950, and Walter then completed two different doctorate degrees: in veterinary medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1954, and in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1965. He fulfilled his medical internship at Mercy Hospital and his Ophthalmology residency at the Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, and served as an Associate Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Baker was a beloved mentor to ophthalmology resident physicians at the Veterans Hospital of Oakland, where he tutored surgical cases to budding physicians for 22 years. He practiced ophthalmology at South Hills Eye Associates of Mt Lebanon for over 30 years, during which he held medical staff appointments at Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, St. Clair Memorial Hospital, Canonsburg Hospital, and Ohio Valley General Hospital. Walter was known for his caring and compassion for his patients – both animal and human. Patients sometimes remarked “If Dr Baker was good enough to take care of my dog, then he’s the one I want to take care of my eyes!”

Walt married Mary Bernadette Marko on September 5, 1953 at Holy Trinity Church, Robinson Township. His love and devotion to Mary dominated their almost 71 years of marriage. They met at a local soda shop, but soon became inseparable. Together they raised nine children with unwavering commitment to the importance of family in daily life. He would say, “it was hard raising the family, but your mother made it all happen”. Dad had a quick wit, a smile, and kind words throughout his life. He loved history and reading, and was unbelievably knowledgeable, with an answer for any question raised. He was always up for the joke of the day, a raised eyebrow in response to dry humor, and a laugh with the family. His face would light up with a welcoming smile when any of his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nephews or nieces were present, making each feel as if they were the most special. Everyone loved Dad, Granddad, Great-Granddad, and Uncle Walt.

Walter was a devoted Catholic who practiced his faith in every aspect of his life. He had a special devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, praying the Rosary with family members each day. Everyone knew not to call between 9:30pm and 10pm: Mom and Dad were not going to answer during the EWTN rosary. He served as one of the first four Eucharistic Ministers at Holy Trinity Catholic Church and continued this for 44 years, was an instrumental supporter of Holy Trinity Catholic School, participated on multiple committees for school expansion and improvements, and was actively involved in the annual Holy Trinity Festival. He was a leader in community organizations including serving as past-president of Robinson Township Lions Club, member of the American Legion, supporter of the St. Vincent DePaul Society for the Poor, and member of multiple medical organizations.

Walt was an avid gardener—a family of nine children needed lots of vegetables! He loved growing crops alongside family, teaching every step of the way, passing on his knowledge of gardening and grafting fruit trees. The Steelers also held a special place in Dad’s heart. As a season ticket holder since 1969, he regularly attended home games until recently. Dad would not leave until the clock showed triple zeros! He saw Franco’s “Immaculate Reception” and enjoyed traveling to Super Bowl victories. Dad and Mom shared a passion for sports, watching any and all sporting events, side by side. They also loved traveling together, with Florida a favorite destination.

Walter is preceded in death by his beloved wife Mary, his parents Gertrude and Sylvester Baker, his siblings Virginia Smith, Mary Louise Karns, Michael Baker, Sylvia Clark, Sylvester Baker, and Ronald Baker. He is survived by his children Marybeth McCutcheon (Jake), Theressa Strong (Rick), Walter Baker (Michelle), Karen Lauer (Harrison), Susie Shipley (Neal), Lori Roberts (Michael), Elizabeth Moshier (Mike), Brad Baker (Marielle), and Anne Wible (Russ). He is also survived by 31 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.

Family and friends are welcome on Wednesday, January 14, 2026 from 6:00-8:30 PM and Thursday, January 15, 2026 from 2:00- 4:00 PM and 6:00-8:30 PM at Pittsburgh Cremation And Funeral Care, 5405 Steubenville Pike, Robinson Township, PA 15136.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was ""deeply engaged"" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a ""great choice"" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had ""served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.""

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

What could become of those colorful trading cards that are sitting in an attic? It may have seemed frivolous back then, but today Pokémon cards bring in serious cash.

The dozens of people lined up outside of the Best Buy at Atlantic Terminal Mall weren’t there for a special Black Friday sale on electronics. They queued for a regular release of Pokémon card packs, which they hoped could hold their golden ticket.

Unlike the traditional sports collector cards, Pokémon stand out among the rest in the trading card space because the colorful characters cannot lose favor the way an athlete can. Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Matt Strahm, joked in an interview with YouTube reporter Tyler Boronski.

“Pikachu is not going to tear his ACL…Charizard is not going to get a DUI,” Strahm said.

The Poké-craze might have hit America in the late 1990s, but the money flowing through the franchise over the past few years has completely eclipsed its previous peaks. In 2022, Logan Paul, a famous internet creator, purchased a single Pokémon card for more than $5 million. The Guinness World Record for the most expensive Pokémon card ever sold.

In the first set ever released in the United States, a card pulled from a $4 pack of cards in January of 1999, is now worth thousands of dollars before grading. To grade a card is to preserve the item in a protective sealed plastic slab, which is then ranked on a scale of one to ten to determine the quality of the item. The same card when graded a maximum 10 the value of the card can jump to hundreds of thousands according to pricecharting.com.

This October, the Wall Street Journal identified Pokémon cards as having a higher market return than global titans like Meta Platforms and the S&P 500. The nostalgic trading card game is heading into its 27th year in the United States.These colorful pieces of cardboard aren’t subject to standard financial regulations and pay no dividends. The value of these cards draws buyers to storefronts hours before opening, all for a chance to pull a high-value card from a pack they might not even be able to get.

On Nov. 1, 2025, PokéCourt opened its doors. The first of its kind storefront located in the Meatpacking District of New York City dedicated exclusively to Pokémon. The opening garnered attention from several publications, including Time Out Magazine and Curbed. The store has a floor-to-ceiling stock of rare cards, unique memorabilia, and products up-charged to match their rarity and the deepening pockets of collectors, it’s pure eye candy for anyone involved in the hobby.

Treating rare trading cards as dramatically valued assets isn’t new. The 1952 Mickey Mantle baseball card was bought for over $12 million in 2022. Music superstar Post Malone purchased a trading card from the game “Magic: The Gathering,” for an estimated $2 million.

Brook Trafton, the collector who pulled and sold the card to Malone, said in a TikTok post “…for a guy like me, being able to sell it is life changing.”

This doesn’t mean that the cards don’t fluctuate in value. Not every card released reaches the dramatic heights to catch mainstream attention. During the most recent set release “Phantasmal Flames,” a card of the character Charizard was originally estimated at $1,600 and $4,100 graded. In just two months, it has plummeted to around $600 and $2,200 graded according to COLLECTR, an app that looks similar to many mainstream stock trading apps. COLLECTR allows you to track the value of individual cards aggregated from multiple digital marketplaces such as eBay and TCGPlayer. COLLECTR refers to a collection as a “portfolio,” reinforcing the idea that these are assets to invest in.

For some, the investment is worth waiting outside a Brooklyn Best Buy on a cold Friday morning. Dozens of people spent hours in the cold with hopes of purchasing some cards. Jonathan Harris, 33, said that what brought him to the front of the line was: “the money, the worth of the cards.”

He wasn’t the only person who was in it for the chase of a big hit. Nadia Nizam, 31, said she used to buy and resell clothes and sneakers, but switched to Pokémon cards since they don’t have to worry about “size value,” meaning a size six could be worth more than a size 13.

“Cards are cards, if you have it, you have the money,” Nizam said.

The thrill of the chase has caused a dramatic influx of pressure on storefronts to have large enough stock. The shift is so great, some local hobby shops like Brooklyn Strategist in Carroll Gardens, have hired a “Trading Card Game Coordinator” to manage requests and inventory. Vona Rustay was hand-selected and poached from another hobby shop for her experience. She and the store’s inventory manager have to navigate the delicate balance between fulfilling requests and servicing their community of everyday customers. Rustay said that for their Phantasmal Flames release, almost all of their stock was spoken for before it could even arrive.

“If you told someone they’re selling money at the money store, it’s not unreasonable to believe that the money store would sell out of money pretty quickly, right?” Rustay asked.

It’s not always a winning experience, for some people the chase is tiring. Marcus Joseph, 30, a teacher, was compelled to wait in line early in the morning before going to work, just to engage with their hobby and not pay inflated resale prices, which have created a growing friction between long time players and people coming in only interested in the value of the cards.

“The increase in price is pricing individuals out of their favorite hobby they grew up with as kids or they’re just getting into right now.” Joseph said with an exhale. “And that’s always going to be a negative.”

Brooklyn Strategist implements several stopgap measures to ensure children in their after-school programs and players of the card game can engage with the game meant for them, including a purchase limit of three packs per person per day, and reserving some stock to give away as prizes to those playing the game at their events. Rustay said that it’s an effective way to maintain and continue to strengthen their community.

Across North America, people are even breaking out into fights in an effort to purchase

cards from the Phantasmal Flames set. The demand is so high, two men were charged with assault after an incident in Ottawa, Canada when they got into a fist fight over trying to purchase the product. With popularity and access ebbing and flowing, it’s unclear whether Pokémon cards will still be worth fighting over in the next year or not.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms.
In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.
Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee.
According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.","New York — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

Dive Brief:

USA Truck CEO George Henry, former CEO James Reed and former CFO Zachary King have finalized a deal to buy the carrier from DSV. The transaction closed Friday

The publicly traded company, headquartered in Hedehusene, Denmark, acquired USA Truck in April 2025 by buying parent company DB Schenker. Potential divestment and a strategic review took up much of the year.

“The extensive knowledge and global supply chain insights gained under two of the world's leading freight forwarders are now a permanent part of our operational DNA,” Henry said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

An Arkansas-based entity called UTAC is buying USA Truck and its subsidies, returning ownership to where the company’s legacy began according to a news release.

The switch “allows USA Truck to operate with greater speed, flexibility, and focus, prioritizing customer relationships, service reliability, and disciplined growth,” the release said.

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, and DSV didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.

USA Truck began in 1983 when Bob Powell and others bought Crawford Produce. An initial public offering took place in 1992. In 2022, shareholders of the privately owned DB Schenker approved an acquisition deal.

USA Truck currently has 1,800 trucks and 6,000 trailers and provides dedicated, intermodal, logistics and other transportation services.

Other M&A is also kicking off the new year. The Oren family, which has controlled the Dart transportation business for over 90 years, sold to a private investment firm in a deal effective Jan. 1.

Such deals could accelerate given broader economic changes, according to PwC. “Easing interest rates and a modest rebound in freight volumes are enabling buyers to revisit deals that were paused earlier in the cycle,” a report last month said.

For investors, the takeaway is clear: the valuation of pharmaceutical companies will increasingly depend on their ""compute-to-chemistry"" ratio.","In a move that signals the definitive arrival of the ""AI-first"" era for the pharmaceutical industry, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a massive expansion of their strategic partnership today at the 44th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (JPM26). The centerpiece of the announcement is a first-of-its-kind ""AI Co-Innovation Lab,"" a $1 billion joint venture designed to fundamentally re-engineer the drug discovery process through ""lab-in-the-loop"" automation and physical AI.

The partnership marks a transition from using artificial intelligence as a simple data-processing tool to integrating it as a core scientific collaborator. By combining Lilly’s deep biological expertise with Nvidia’s cutting-edge Vera Rubin computing architecture, the two giants aim to slash drug development timelines from a decade to as little as three years. This alliance is not just a technological upgrade; it is a structural shift in how the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical company intends to maintain its lead in the hyper-competitive cardiometabolic and oncology markets.

A New Blueprint for Biological Discovery

The AI Co-Innovation Lab, scheduled to open in South San Francisco by late March 2026, represents a $1 billion commitment over the next five years. The facility will be staffed by a hybrid team of Lilly research scientists and Nvidia AI engineers working side-by-side. The primary objective is to perfect ""closed-loop"" discovery: a system where AI agents autonomously design new molecular structures, trigger robotic ""wet labs"" to synthesize and test them, and then instantly ingest the experimental data to refine the next round of designs. This ""lab-in-the-loop"" workflow is expected to operate 24/7, effectively removing the human bottleneck from early-stage candidate selection.

The technological backbone of this initiative is Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin architecture and an expanded version of the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform. This follows an earlier collaboration in late 2025 where the companies built a massive ""AI factory"" supercomputer utilizing over 1,000 Blackwell GPUs. Beyond discovery, the new lab will focus on ""digital twins"" for advanced manufacturing. By simulating production lines in a virtual environment, Lilly aims to optimize the complex manufacturing processes required for its high-demand GLP-1 medications, potentially solving the supply constraints that have dogged the industry for years.

Winners, Losers, and the Tech-Pharma Arms Race

The immediate winners of this announcement are undoubtedly Eli Lilly and Nvidia. For Lilly, the partnership solidifies its reputation as the most technologically advanced ""Big Pharma"" player, moving beyond the ""hype cycle"" of AI into tangible, operational scale. For Nvidia, the deal provides a massive real-world proving ground for its healthcare-specific hardware and software, cementing its position as the ""arms dealer"" for the future of medicine.

However, the news puts immense pressure on rivals. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Lilly’s primary competitor in the obesity market, has its own partnerships with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia, but analysts at JPM26 noted that Lilly’s move toward a co-located, dedicated lab gives it a superior ""operational edge."" Meanwhile, legacy biotech firms that have been slower to adopt ""agentic AI"" may find themselves falling behind in discovery speed. In the tech sector, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) remains a formidable challenger through its Isomorphic Labs, which recently launched the TxGemma models. While Google’s AI prowess is undisputed, Nvidia’s focus on the ""physicality"" of AI—robotics and manufacturing—gives it a distinct advantage in the eyes of pharmaceutical executives who need to produce physical pills and injections.

Navigating the Regulatory Frontier and Industry Trends

This partnership arrives at a critical regulatory juncture. In early January 2026, the FDA released its first formal draft guidance on the use of AI in drug development. The new framework emphasizes ""methodological transparency"" and requires companies to prove that their AI models do not suffer from ""drift"" or bias over time. The Lilly-Nvidia lab is specifically designed to meet these high bars by creating a ""traceable"" AI path, where every decision made by an algorithm is backed by physical data from the robotic wet labs.

The broader industry trend is a shift away from ""narrow AI""—which solves specific, small problems—toward ""General Purpose Biological AI."" We are moving past the era of simply predicting how a protein folds (a milestone achieved years ago by DeepMind) to predicting how a drug will interact with an entire human organ system. This ""digital twin"" approach is the new gold standard, and the LLY-NVDA alliance is the first to attempt it at a multi-billion-dollar scale.

The Road Ahead: From Silicon to Clinical Trials

In the short term, the market will be watching for the official opening of the South San Francisco lab in March 2026 and the first batch of ""AI-native"" drug candidates to enter Phase 1 trials. The long-term challenge will be the ""black box"" problem: can Lilly convince regulators that a drug designed by an AI agent is as safe as one designed by a human chemist? Strategic pivots may be required if the FDA demands higher levels of human oversight than the ""closed-loop"" system currently envisions.

Furthermore, the partnership will likely trigger a wave of M&A activity. Smaller biotech companies with unique datasets will become prime targets for ""Big Tech"" and ""Big Pharma"" alliances looking to feed their hungry AI models. Companies like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), which recently acquired Dark Blue Therapeutics to bolster its own AI oncology pipeline, are already signaling that they will not let Lilly and Nvidia run away with the market without a fight.

A Final Assessment of the JPM26 Milestone

The Eli Lilly and Nvidia partnership expansion is more than just a corporate deal; it is the blueprint for the pharmaceutical company of the future. By merging the world’s most advanced computing with the world’s most successful drug development pipeline, the two companies are attempting to solve the ""Eroom’s Law"" problem—the observation that drug development becomes slower and more expensive over time.

For investors, the takeaway is clear: the valuation of pharmaceutical companies will increasingly depend on their ""compute-to-chemistry"" ratio. As the JPM26 conference concludes, the market will be looking for signs of ""model reliability"" and the first signs of shortened clinical timelines. The intersection of Big Tech and Big Pharma has officially moved from the laboratory to the factory floor, and the impact on global healthcare could be profound.

""We intend to launch in many, many countries around the world, as quickly as possible,"" Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific and product officer, told Reuters at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, which kicked off on Monday in San Francisco.

He said the $150-a-month cash pay price will put the drug in reach of consumers who have been priced out of getting the new obesity treatments until recently.

""It's hard to find a cup of coffee for $149 a month, that's $5 a day. We've spent billions of dollars in science here, and tens of billions of dollars to build factories to make this. Then we're offering it at Starbucks pricing,"" Skovronsky said.

CONVENIENCE VERSUS NOVO'S PILL

Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO), opens new tab launched its once-daily weight-loss pill in the U.S. earlier this month, and Lilly expects to counter the first-to-market advantage by emphasizing the convenience of orforglipron.

While Novo's oral semaglutide needs to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before eating, drinking or using any other oral medication, Lilly's pill does not have those restrictions.

""Ours is a small molecule. It's just like any other pill. It's not affected by food or water, what time of day you take it, or whether you fast. So I think that's an advantage for patients who want that kind of convenience,"" Skovronsky said.

Skovronsky also said he believes there will be a market for the pill as a maintenance dose for people who want to stop using injectable weight-loss medications - particularly patients on Novo Nordisk's drug.

Many patients who have already lost weight are looking to switch to a less strong drug to maintain their weight, he said.

""People coming off of the monotherapy GLP-1 - coming off of semaglutide injection - can switch to the pill without regaining any substantial weight,"" Skovronsky said.

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER STRATEGY

Skovronsky also touted the reach of Lilly's direct-to-consumer sales program, Lilly Direct, through which patients can buy its Zepbound weight-loss injection without insurance.

He said more than one million people have been treated with its GLP-1s through Lilly Direct.

Skovronsky likened Zepbound to Lilly's own version of what the tech industry calls a ""killer app"" that can familiarize consumers with Lilly Direct.

He said the company hope to extend sales through the program to other treatments like its Alzheimer's drug and an experimental medicine in development to lower lipoprotein (a), a type of cholesterol that like LDL increases heart risk.

This includes missed dose alerts to help minimize glucose insights and a dose calculator to simplify dose decision-making. Action-oriented guidance is issued if a user misses or miscalculates a dose. CareLink software also reports for easier collaboration with providers.

Real-world data shows that users of the previous generation Medtronic Smart MDI system had meaningful improvements in glycemic control when consistently responding to actionable alerts. The data showed that Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when users addressed more than 75% of Missed Dose alerts within an hour, and to 71.5% when users addressed Correct High Glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour.

The investment will help Sirion, which makes contact lifecycle management software infused with AI, “accelerate product innovation and expand global reach”, the companies said.

The deal highlights the growing attraction of the legaltech sector to investors. Last year, Harvey, one of the biggest suppliers of legal AI software, closed a new round of funding led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, valuing it at $8bn.

Sirion has 10 offices, including in the US, Canada, UK, France, India and Singapore.

Sumit Pande, senior managing director at Haveli, said: “As AI becomes increasingly central to how enterprises operate, we see strong structural tailwinds for AI-first platforms that sit at the core of business workflows.”

Ajay Agrawal, Sirion founder and CEO, added: “Contracts sit at the heart of every major enterprise transaction… and they increasingly define how value flows through an organisation.”

Sirion, which was founded in India in 2012 but is now headquartered in the US, says it has grown by an average of 40% per year over the past five years and recently turned profitable.

AI referrals consist of online-shopper traffic generated by clicking on a link in an answer generated by an AI chatbot or automated system.
Adobe Analytics tracked more than 1 trillion visits to retail e-commerce sites in the United States, 100 million stock-keeping units, and 18 product categories.
“This is where things get especially interesting for retailers,” Vivek Pandya, director of digital insights at Adobe Analytics, says in a blog post.","Artificial intelligence is playing a significantly bigger role in online shopping, according to Adobe Analytics. During the 2025 holiday shopping season, AI referrals generated a nearly seven-fold increase in online retail shopping traffic, compared to a year earlier, Adobe says.

At the same time, conversion rates from AI referrals were 31% higher than from other online sources—nearly double that seen in the same period a year ago—during the 2025 holiday shopping period, which ran Nov. 1 through Dec. 31. Shopping-driven events, such as Black Friday, also saw significantly higher year-over-year increases. AI-driven conversions on Thanksgiving Day were 54% higher than those not AI-driven, and 38% higher on Black Friday, Adobe says.

AI referrals consist of online-shopper traffic generated by clicking on a link in an answer generated by an AI chatbot or automated system.

The increase in AI-generated referrals and conversions helped boost AI-driven revenue per visit more than two-fold during the holiday shopping season.

Adobe Analytics tracked more than 1 trillion visits to retail e-commerce sites in the United States, 100 million stock-keeping units, and 18 product categories.

In addition to tracking AI referrals and conversions, Adobe tracked what happens after shoppers click through a link from a generative AI-powered chat service or browser.

“This is where things get especially interesting for retailers,” Vivek Pandya, director of digital insights at Adobe Analytics, says in a blog post.

Shoppers who arrive at retail sites from generative-AI assistants were 33% less likely to leave immediately, a 14% improvement since the beginning of 2025, Adobe says.

“In practical terms, this means shoppers arriving from AI assistants aren’t just landing and leaving,” Pandya says. “They’re spending 45% more time on-site and viewing 13% more pages per visit, signaling higher intent and stronger alignment with what they’re looking for.” Some 81% of online shoppers using AI assistants reported a better shopping experience.

One reason consumers are actively embracing AI referrals is trust in the technology, according to the research. Some 47% of consumers reported trust in AI, while 64% of shoppers using AI report being satisfied with the links they receive, and more than 55% say they actively click on those links, according to the Adobe Analytics Holiday 2025 Consumer Survey. In addition, 65% of online shoppers using AI are more confident in their purchase after the help of AI, and 68% say they are less likely to return the product after using AI for the purchase.

“As trust grows, purchase confidence is also rising,” Pandya says. “As more consumers turn to large language models to research products, compare options, and make decisions, one thing is becoming clear: generative AI is no longer a side channel for commerce discovery.”",https://v6r2p5t5.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:02:47.426022

Under the pilot, announced on Friday, BNY has enabled an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform. The tokenized deposits operate as digital book entries that reflect participating clients’ existing demand deposit claims against the bank. While balances are mirrored on-chain, they continue to be recorded on BNY’s traditional systems for regulatory, accounting, and reporting purposes.

The capability runs on BNY’s private, permissioned blockchain. The bank said the launch is designed to support programmable, near-real-time cash movement, as is increasingly demanded by financial market participants.

“As global financial markets shift towards an always-on operating model, institutions are seeking faster and more efficient ways to move assets — with greater settlement certainty, transparency, lower friction and capability to unlock liquidity,” said BNY chief product and innovation officer Carolyn Wei.

BNY, the world’s largest custodial bank with nearly $58 trillion in assets under custody, has been exploring tokenized deposits for some time. Banking Exchange first reported in late 2025 that the bank was testing the capability, which has now progressed into a live pilot for institutional clients.

Early participants in the initiative include Baillie Gifford, Circle, Citadel Securities, Galaxy, Ripple Prime, Invesco, and WisdomTree.

Less covered, but certainly related and also followed by investors and analysts, was the concurrent rise of copper (+36%). However, another industrial metal commodity advanced by an even larger amount under the radar of many investors focused on precious metals: Aluminum. From April 25 to the time of this writing, aluminum prices have gained over +842 points, or roughly +38%, to a near all time high of $3,090 per ton.

There are a myriad of reasons for aluminum’s price surge, but lower supply and higher demand, combined with geopolitical policy domino effects, are the primary causes. Nevertheless, the price trajectory, like that of gold and silver, shows little signs of abating. Therefore, stocks that will be able to capitalize on this continued price elevation may be of interest to investors. Some major companies’ stocks to keep an eye on are:

Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CCK)

Constellium SE (NYSE: CSTM)

Kaiser Aluminum (NASDAQ: KALU)

Reliance, Inc. (NYSE: RS)

When Tariffs Move Markets

Like pretty much all market prices, Aluminum fell precipitously shortly following President Trump’s reciprocal tariff announcement at the end of March. Since China, the EU, and the US are the three largest global aluminum market consumers, the US deployment of tariffs on aluminum imports triggered a price hike that has continued to the present. The US market was impacted in a number of ways that contributed to the global price elevation:

Since the goal of the tariffs was to support domestic production, imports, with some aluminum items taxed as much as 50%, were subsequently priced too expensively to make it worthwhile for export nations to ship to the US.

With imports curtailed and domestic production having no lead time to gear up for production, US inventory supplies dwindled, causing accelerated price demand.

Ironically, the BBB tax cuts have boosted US manufacturing in automobiles, aircraft, consumer and industrial container packaging, construction, and other domestic production industries, along with the new huge demand from AI data centers. These industries are all dependent upon aluminum, and the low inventory levels contributed to the price squeeze.

Geological difficulties in locating new sources of bauxite to produce aluminum have also caused international commodity market prices of aluminum to elevate over future shortage concerns.

Crown Holdings, Inc.

Headquartered in Philadelphia, PA with a history dating back to the end of the 19th century (1892), Crown Holdings is one of the premier global manufacturers of aluminum cans, packaging, and specialty containers. The company has operations in the Americas, Western Europe (out of Switzerland distributing also to Africa and the Middle East), and Asia (via Singapore). A short list of their global customer list includes such multinational brands as:

Anheuser-Busch

Conagra Brands

Abbot Labs

Clorox

Coca-Cola

Campbell’s

Diageo

Federal Express

Dupont

General Mills

Kraft-Heinz

Pitney Bowes

Pepsico…. And the list goes on.

With a $261 million stake, Impactive Capital is CCK’s largest shareholder. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded their rating on CCK to “overweight”, citing increases in energy drinks, hard teas, and other new beverages. Additionally, CCK’s stranglehold on supplying aluminum containers for so many global brands over so many years gives it a commanding supply chain control over its customers, who would likely find switching to another supplier too costly.

Constellium SE

A joint American-Swiss and French amalgam as result of M&A deals combining Alcan, Alusuisse, and Pechiney, Constellium is a global producer of rolled and extruded aluminum and various alloys, as well as of custom parts. Its customers include:

Airbus

BMW

Mercedes-Benz

Boeing

Ford

Audi

Headquartered in Paris, France, Constellum also has offices in Zurich, Switzerland, and Baltimore, MD. Constellum’s large aluminum use clientele has certainly driven its stock price in sympathy with the aluminum market price: since April 2025, its stock has zoomed from $7.56 to $21.00. Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and UBS all rate CTSM a “buy”.

Kaiser Aluminum

Formed in 1946 right after WW II, Kaiser has had a history of acquisitions, divestments, military and government projects, unionwide labor disputes and even a 4-year long bankruptcy period. However, the Franklin, TN company has bounced back each time to pick up the pieces and get back into the ring. Kaiser’s primary products are rolled aluminum, plate, sheet, can sheet, and extruded bar, tube, and wire products. Its unique, special niche is its specialty fabricated ALH26 products for the aerospace and automotive industries. Among Kaiser’s 750 regular corporate customers are:

Boeing

General Electric

Avid Technology

Weyerhauser

Whirlpool

Stanley, Black & Decker

Stellantis

Northrop Grumman

Lockheed Martin

Similar to Constellium, Kaiser’s stock has also made triple digit gains since April, going from $48 to $123. From a fundamental analysis perspective, KALU has an attractive 2.50% yield and 2025 revenue is expected to report 10.64% growth with 12.95% in 2026, and estimated earnings to report +135.53% for 2025 with an extra +22.45% in 2026.

Reliance, Inc.

When it comes to US metals processing services, Reliance is the #1 largest metal solutions provider, distributing and processing over 100,000 metal products through a vast network of service centers. In addition to aluminum, Reliance also processes carbon steel, stainless steel, brass, titanium, and a range of alloys. Reliance also handles cutting, inventory, and specialty fabrication. Its 320 locations handle 15% of cumulative US metals processing.

A 20,000-sq.-ft. state-of-the-art R&D space will include 15 reactors ranging from 20L through 250L, and the facility may be expanded multifold in the future with room to quadrupole capacity.

“We have grown rapidly over the past year, well above the wider market, by expanding our FFS offerings, which enable innovators to advance discovery projects with lower risk,” Giuliano Perfetti, CEO, Jubilant Biosys Limited, said in a press release (1). “With improving funding conditions, we anticipate even higher demand next year, and this new facility doubles our existing capabilities. From a client perspective, we can now provide faster discovery delivery and integrated scale-up, with projects seamlessly transferred to our GMP facilities ready for any IND filing and commercial phases.”

How are other outsourcing providers meeting capacity needs?

A variety of contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) made moves in 2025 to expand facilities and services to meet market demands. In August 2025, Bora Pharmaceuticals expanded manufacturing and packaging capabilities at its Maple Grove, Minn facility that will include 100,000 square feet of dedicated shell space to streamline high-volume production (2).

In June 2025, CDMO, Piramal Pharma Solutions, broke ground on a new sterile injectables development and manufacturing facility in Lexington, Ky. The dedicated fill/finish facility will have services for all integrated programs and specialize in sterile compounding, liquid filling, and lyophilization for sterile injectable drug products (3). The expansion, which is expected to be completed by late 2027, will accommodate commercial-scale sterile injectable manufacturing with 24,000 additional square feet, plus a new laboratory, a new filling line, specialized capping machine, external vial washer, and two commercial-size lyophilizers.

SK pharmteco announced a $6.1 million investment at its Rancho Cordova, Calif. facility in October that expands its solid-phase peptide synthesis and purification capabilities (4). The company also is planning a $260 million small-molecule and peptide production facility in South Korea (5).

The collaboration centers on integrating EndoQuest’s visualization system, robotic control and secure cloud services with NVIDIA’s Physical AI software stack to deliver real-time image processing, robotic control and cloud-enabled intelligence within a unified architecture. The company said the approach is intended to support real-time, image-based solutions for intraoperative tissue differentiation, perfusion visualization and select autonomous surgical tasks.

The next-generation platform is also expected to incorporate capabilities for remote robotic operation, teleproctoring for surgical guidance and collaborative surgical workflows, orchestrated to achieve the lowest possible latency using NVIDIA Holoscan software development tools.

“AI and robotics will redefine the operating room by enhancing surgical vision and precision beyond human limits,” said Todd Wilson, chief medical officer and chairman of the International Advisory Board of EndoQuest Robotics. “This shift will enable earlier diagnosis and highly targeted therapies that minimize patient impact while maximizing the potential for cure.”

Eduardo Fonseca, chief executive officer of EndoQuest Robotics, said the company is focused on simplifying and strengthening its technology foundation. “By powering our visualization, control, and secure cloud services with NVIDIA AI infrastructure, we aim to streamline our system architecture for performance, reliability and clinical scalability,” Fonseca said. “This unified architecture is critical to advancing our technology for endoluminal robotic surgery and supporting future capabilities in imaging intelligence, robotic performance, and connected surgical workflows.”

As part of the initiative, EndoQuest will use NVIDIA AI infrastructure to support low-latency sensor processing and 3D visualization, precise and time-synchronized motion control, and secure cloud connectivity. The company said these capabilities will enable fleet management, data services, teleproctoring and future artificial intelligence deployment, with insights informing product development and commercialization plans.

The announcement coincides with EndoQuest’s PARADIGM Trial, a pivotal multicenter study evaluating the company’s endoluminal surgical system for lower gastrointestinal procedures performed by colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists.

Advances in endoluminal robotic surgery

Endoluminal robotic surgery is emerging as a significant area of innovation within minimally invasive care, driven by advances in imaging, computing power and artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional laparoscopic or open approaches, endoluminal systems are designed to operate through natural orifices, allowing physicians to reach lesions deep within the gastrointestinal tract while minimizing external incisions and trauma.

Recent progress has focused heavily on improving visualization. High-definition, 3D imaging combined with real-time image processing is enabling surgeons to better distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue during procedures. Emerging techniques such as enhanced perfusion imaging and tissue characterization are helping clinicians assess blood flow and tissue viability intraoperatively, potentially improving decision-making and outcomes.

Robotic control systems have also become more sophisticated, with improved dexterity, stability and precision in confined anatomical spaces. Advances in motion scaling, tremor reduction and time-synchronized control are allowing more precise manipulation of instruments, which is particularly important in delicate GI procedures where millimeters matter.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly being layered into these platforms, supporting functions such as image recognition, workflow assistance and early steps toward task automation. While fully autonomous surgery remains a long-term goal, current systems are exploring semi-autonomous features that can assist with repetitive or highly standardized tasks under physician supervision.

Connectivity is another key trend shaping the sector. Secure cloud integration is enabling remote system monitoring, data aggregation and analytics, as well as teleproctoring, where experienced clinicians can guide procedures from afar. This has implications not only for training and consistency of care, but also for expanding access to advanced procedures in settings that may lack on-site expertise.

Together, these advances point toward operating rooms that are increasingly data-driven, connected and precise, with endoluminal robotic technologies playing a growing role in less invasive diagnosis and treatment of complex gastrointestinal conditions.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/medec/a33cf50ebdcf5494f27cac1af639b8dd67227891-5501x3667.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:03:29.291420

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.5%.","Uber Technologies (UBER) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this ride-hailing company have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Uber belongs, has gained 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Uber is expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -74.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.5%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.61 indicates a change of -32.7% from what Uber is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Uber.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/zacks.com/432476d296d64c50172213c0415587c9,N,,2026-01-12 11:14:47.953747

The companies announced plans to bring drone delivery to 150 additional stores across the country, creating the largest commercial drone network in U.S. history.

This expansion will establish over 270 drone delivery locations by 2027, serving roughly 40 million people and making aerial deliveries as common as ordering pizza. The rollout kicks off with Houston launching Jan. 15, followed by major metros including Los Angeles, Miami, St. Louis, and Cincinnati throughout 2026 and 2027.

An American retail tale

The numbers tell a decent story. Wing’s most active customers are ordering three times per week, while total deliveries have tripled in just the past six months. That’s more frequent than most people order takeout. People aren’t just trying drone delivery once—they’re making it part of their daily routine for essentials like eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, and even Takis snacks.

Customers have already completed hundreds of thousands of deliveries since the partnership launched over two years ago in August 2023. The expansion builds on operations in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, where people have turned 30-minute aerial grocery runs into normal behavior.

Say hi to the sky

Here’s why customers are ditching traditional delivery methods for robots in the sky. Wing’s aircraft can carry up to 2.5 pounds (1.13 kg) normally, but newer models handle five-pound payloads while cruising at 65 mph (ca. 105 km/h)—fast enough to beat most car trips across town of up to 12 miles (ca. 19 km) round trip.

The drones operate beyond visual line of sight up to six miles (ca. 10 km) from stores, using tethers and hooks to pick up packages from designated parking lot sites before dropping them on customers’ front lawns.

Since launching in 2012, Wing has completed over 750,000 deliveries globally. The company isn’t just focused on retail either—they’re also partnering with DoorDash for restaurant deliveries in Dallas and Charlotte, creating an aerial delivery ecosystem that’s reshaping last-mile logistics.

Rise of the robots

This massive scale-up signals that drone delivery has moved far beyond experimental phase into mainstream utility. Walmart becomes the first retailer operating drone delivery across five states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas—with over 150,000 deliveries completed over the past five years since launching the program in 2021.

Within the next decade, McKinsey projects 1.5 million commercial drone deliveries by 2035, and Wing and Walmart are positioning themselves at the forefront of what could become the dominant delivery method for small, urgent purchases across America.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2026/01/Wing-Drones.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:04:14.114986

BioNeMo includes several open models, which come with open datasets.","Eli Lilly and Nvidia, two primary drivers of the recent stock market rally, are deepening their alliance to connect silicon with biology through artificial-intelligence-powered drug development.

The two companies will establish a new AI co-innovation lab with a commitment to invest more than $1 billion over five years, Nvidia announced at the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.

“This co-innovation lab is dedicated to achieving accelerated, closed-loop discovery and the creation of AI models to improve clinical development,” Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at Nvidia, said in a press briefing.

Scientists from the two firms will come together at a new site in the Bay Area that the pair expects to open by the end of March, Powell said.

Both sides are allocating dedicated, incremental resources to the partnership. Lilly will contribute its drug R&D expertise and laboratory infrastructure, while Nvidia will provide AI capabilities including open biology models, multimodal foundation models, agentic and physical AI, and DGX Cloud capacity, according to Powell.

“We see this as a catalyst for the capabilities that will define the next era of drug discovery,” Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly, said in a Jan. 12 statement. “By working with NVIDIA, we’re uniting massive compute, specialized talent and the ability to shape data at immense scale. We’re moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models—an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development.”

The latest collaboration between Lilly and Nvidia builds on the companies’ “AI factory” project, under which Nvidia is helping Lilly build what could become the pharmaceutical industry’s largest supercomputer designed to accelerate drug discovery and shorten development timelines.

For the new joint lab, a major focus will be on producing real-world lab data to train and validate AI models.

“We’re going to continue to create ground truth data in the lab so that we can train these biology foundation models with multimodal data, taking advantage of all of the advancements that we’ve seen in [large language model] in biology,” Powell said.

With the help of AI, the team will work to shorten the process between hypotheses and discovery in the hopes of establishing a new scientific paradigm, Powell added.

In addition to R&D, the two firms will have the opportunity to apply AI across Lilly’s businesses, including manufacturing and commercial operations. Powell highlighted Nvidia’s three physical AI and robotics platforms—Omniverse, Isaac and Jetson—which she said can fit into Lilly’s manufacturing facilities.

Lilly and Nvidia are broadening their collaboration as both invest heavily in each other’s territories.

“Lilly is shifting from using AI as a tool to embracing it as a scientific collaborator,” Lilly’s chief AI officer, Thomas Fuchs, said in an October release about the new “AI factory.”

To extend the reach of its AI capabilities, Lilly last year launched Lilly TuneLab, an open innovation platform that gives biotech companies access to its AI drug discovery models. In return, the ecosystem creates a two-way flow of information that provides Lilly with new data to refine those models.

Friday, Schrödinger announced it’s integrating Lilly’s Tunelab into its drug design software, LiveDesign.

For its part, Nvidia will announce at JPM an expansion of its BioNeMo into a full open development platform for biology and drug discovery. BioNeMo includes several open models, which come with open datasets. Among some of the latest additions are a model for predicting 3D structure of RNA molecules, a reasoning model called ReaSyn v2 for ensuring AI-designed molecules are practical to synthesize and another for predicting toxicity, according to Powell. Besides, BioNeMo Recipes will help scale biological foundation model training, customization and deployment.

“Instead of just sending a model over the fence, we’re giving the whole developer community the end-to-end tools accompanied with the data sets, the models themselves, the training recipes and everything in between, so that the full AI life cycle can be taken advantage of and made very easy for the domain experts across the field,” Powell said.

On the robotics front, Multiply Labs, which offers robotic systems for manufacturing gene-modified cell therapies, is using Nvidia’s three physical AI platforms to create digital twins of entire labs, replacing manual, contamination-prone work with autonomous systems. According to Powell, the robotic systems could cut cell therapy manufacturing costs by 70% per dose and increase dose throughput 100-fold per square foot by reducing the need for highly trained personnel and related equipment.

At JPM, Nvidia also announced it is working with Thermo Fisher Scientific to build autonomous lab infrastructure.

Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) is a Google initiative, backed by major retailers

Businesses can target customers with ads designed for AI shoppers

Google has announced plans to take the stress out of online shopping with a new agentic AI ecommerce suite that'll take care of product research, purchasing, and even post-purchase support.

Company VP and GM of Ads & Commerce Vidhya Srinivasan explained in a blog post that the new tools build on 2025's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), designed to offer secure payments within the confines of agentic AI.

The system relies on the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), co-developed by Google and a number of major retail partners like Shopify, Etsy, and Wayfair, so that agents and systems can interact in one ""common language.""

Universal Commerce Protocol is the foundation for agentic AI shopping

Designed to work across multiple industries and platforms, it's also backed by payment companies like Adyen, Amex, Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe - however, from launch we're told it will only be available to eligible US retailers.

The front-end experience revolves around the Gemini app or AI Mode within Google Search. Being that the AI retains information, Google's new shopping assistant will pre-fill the checkout page, and then store the shipping information within Google Wallet.

Along with a later global expansion, the company is also working on a fuller shopping experience such as loyalty reward integration.

At the same time, Google is launching a separate Business Agent that companies can use as their own virtual sales assistants to answer questions about their products. With this tool activated and customized from within the Merchant Center, companies can train the agent on their data, access customer insights and promote related products.

A new Google Ads pilot, Direct Offers, will also target shoppers with exclusive offers that might only be available to shoppers using AI Mode.

However, Google isn't without its competition. OpenAI has already launched similar agentic shopping experiences within ChatGPT, and Microsoft launched a buying experience within Copilot chats with select retailers just days before Google's announcement.

GALWAY, Ireland, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of its MiniMed Go™ app. The MiniMed Go™ Smart Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) system seamlessly integrates the InPen™ smart insulin pen with the Instinct sensor made by Abbott — all connected through the MiniMed Go™ app. This powerful combination delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance, including:

Missed dose alerts to help minimize glucose highs

A dose calculator that simplifies dose decision-making

Action-oriented guidance if a user misses or miscalculates a dose

CareLink™ software reporting for easier provider collaboration

The MiniMed Go™ system is cleared for individuals with insulin-requiring type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged 7 years and older, as well as for children ages 2 to 6 years under the supervision of an adult caregiver. Compatibility of the Simplera™ sensor with MiniMed Go™ is currently under FDA review.

Addressing a Significant Unmet Need

There are more than 15 million people around the world with diabetes who rely on multiple daily injections. For these individuals, mealtimes can feel overwhelming and exhausting — and over time, this can lead to diabetes distress.1,2 This involves determining the amount of carbs in their meal and calculating the right insulin dose to inject before eating (bolus) to keep blood sugar levels in check to avoid dangerous spikes or dips.

Missed boluses can significantly impact diabetes management and glycemic outcomes. Even skipping just two doses a week can raise HbA1C by as much as 0.4%, increasing the risk of both short- and long-term complications.3 Remembering when and how much insulin to dose isn't just a math problem — it's a daily burden that adds stress and fatigue, making diabetes management feel overwhelming.

Real-world data demonstrates that users of the previous generation Medtronic Smart MDI system saw meaningful improvements in glycemic control when consistently responding to actionable alerts. Specifically, the data showed that Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when users addressed more than 75% of Missed Dose alerts within an hour, and to 71.5% when users addressed Correct High Glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour. These results underscore the power of timely, actionable insights in helping users achieve better glycemic outcomes.4 The new MiniMed Go™ Smart MDI System delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance to optimize outcomes for users.

""For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and president of Medtronic Diabetes and CEO-designate of MiniMed. ""MiniMed Go™ is designed to change that — bringing the smarts of an AID system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen. The system helps take the guesswork out of MDI therapy, delivering simplicity and confidence in every dose. We're pleased to expand our full-stack insulin delivery solutions, making it seamless for our customers to find a therapy that works for them — no matter where they are in their journey.""

We expect the commercial launch of the MiniMed Go™ system to begin in the U.S. this spring. Learn more here about MiniMed Go™.

Five organizations are moving on to the offseason, and we're here to help. I'm going to break down what went wrong for each of those franchises in the wild-card round, how that might have been foreseeable and what they can do to avoid that same fate next season. Fans invariably want to fire coaches and tear up the roster after a playoff loss, but I'll try to be more level-headed or realistic in projecting what might make sense or what these teams might be thinking.

Let's begin with the Chargers, one of two 7-seeds going home.

Jump to a team:

CAR | GB | JAX | LAC | PHI

Los Angeles Chargers

Lost 16-3 vs. Patriots

I'm not sure a Jim Harbaugh quarterback has ever been beaten up in a big game the way Justin Herbert was hit over and over again by the Patriots on Sunday. With an underwhelming run game, an offense that couldn't diagnoseNew England's coverages, a green light to scramble at the first sign of daylight and little in the way of help from his offensive line, Herbert endured 21 hits for the three points the Chargers scored in Foxborough. That number of hits was tied for Herbert's season high and are the most for any Harbaugh-coached QB in a single game going back through his time in San Francisco.

On one hand, you can argue that Herbert put the team on his back because nobody else was capable of doing so. The Chargers struggled to separate from New England's coverage for most of the night. Running backOmarion Hampton was active but playedonly two snaps with an ankle injury, ceding the backfield to Kimani Vidal, who was ineffective. Drops from the likes of Keenan Allen didn't help matters, and Herbert didn't have a single receiver top 32 yards. He scrambled out of duress for gains, but as a passer, Herbert went just 3-of-8 for 21 yards against pressure.

We can also make the case that the Chargers' season really ended when Joe Alt went down for the second time with what would be a season-ending ankle injury. Losing Rashawn Slater(ruptured patellar tendon) was one thing, but going for months without both starting tackles essentially consigned the Chargers' offense to mediocrity. It fell from third in the league in EPA per play with Alt on the field to 26th without him, cycling through various tackles with little success. On Sunday, the Chargers made a Patriots defense that finished the season 23rd in DVOAlook like the 2003 or 2016 Pats defenses, even as New England lostCarlton Davis IIIand Christian Gonzalez for stretches.

There's no doubting Herbert's capacity for greatness, and I'm not going to draw massive conclusions from three disappointing playoff games. But we're about to hit another offseason where the Chargers' primary job will be to fix things around their quarterback. The Tom Telesco regime (2013-23) repeatedly invested in offensive linemen, with Slater proving to be a success, fellow first-rounder Zion Johnson disappointing and free agent addition Corey Linsley making it to a Pro Bowl before having his career derailed by a heart condition. The first-round pick spent on Quentin Johnston in 2023 has fallen somewhere between obvious success and clear bust.

GM Joe Hortiz has continued adding help, and again, the results have been mixed. Ladd McConkey was a hit in the second round of the 2024 draft, although his impact was muted by the addition of Allen in 2025. Oronde Gadsden emerged as a playmaker at tight end, but Bradley Bozeman was disappointing in his second year with the team at center, and the $9.6 million invested inMekhi Becton didn't deliver the guard who impressed with the Eagles a year ago. The new running back room crashed out because of injuries, and it was Vidal -- even after being cut by the team at the end of camp -- who might have looked like their best back for most of the season.

Slater and Alt will be back in 2026, and betweenpass catchers McConkey, Johnston and Gadsden and running backs Vidal and Hampton, the Chargers will have young playmakers on cost-controlled contracts for another year. Hortiz's job will be to fix the interior of the offensive line. I wonder whether he'll look to make a big offer to centerTyler Linderbaum, a player he is familiar with from their time together with the Ravens and one who is set to hit unrestricted free agency. It's difficult to spend big money on interior linemen with Herbert and Slater already on massive deals and Alt coming due for one next year, but the relatively low cost of the Chargers' playmakers might allow for a big contract on the interior. It would be a surprise if Becton was back.

There's also the question of whether the Chargers will return offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who doesn't have many supporters among Chargers fans after Year 2 in Los Angeles. Roman and Harbaugh arrived in town excited at the idea of what Herbert would look like with a run game, but the Chargers rank 27th in success rate on designed runs over Roman's two seasons.

The clock is also ticking on the defensive side of the ball, where coordinator Jesse Minter's ascension to a head-coaching role seems inevitable. Minter and the Chargers have done a fantastic job of getting more out of players than other coaching staffs, with Elijah Molden and Morgan Fox as examples in 2024 and Donte Jackson and Tony Jeffersonin 2025. The Chargers have some young talent on defense between Tuli Tuipulotu, Daiyan Henleyand several standouts in the secondary, but they were also the league'seighth-oldest defenseon a snap-weighted age basis when I looked in mid-December. If Minter leaves, it's unclear whether Harbaugh and Hortiz will be as capable of finding hidden gems around the league with the next coordinator.

All of this leaves the Chargers in a weird place. They're unquestionably a good team with a coach and quarterback who are deservedly held in high regard. They've also been beaten two years in a row in the wild-card round. I'm still optimistic that there's a higher ceiling with the tackles returning in 2026, but Herbert's propensity for taking hits and the potential loss of Minter might cause the defense to offset any potential gains from the offense. There's nothing wrong with being an 11-win team that doesn't make waves in the postseason, but we know Harbaugh and Herbert are capable of more.

Philadelphia Eagles

Lost 23-19 to the 49ers

If you were building a perfect example of what a frustrating 2025 Eagles loss would look like, it would be what we saw against the 49ers on Sunday. A couple of solid early scores before the offense completely shuts down in the third quarter? Check. Frustrating penalties that wipe away big plays? Check. An offense missing Lane Johnson? A missed kick by Jake Elliott that changed the late-game calculus? An excellent defense let down in spots by its weakest links on the back end? An end-of-game sequence in which the passing game sputters with drops and low-percentage throws? Check, check, check and check.

The Eagles have played variants of this game against good teams for most of the season, with a few breaks going one way or the other late to decide who wins. Things might have been different if Jalen Hurts had been able to escape the pocket and scramble for what looked to be an easy first down in the final sequence, only for 49ers midseason addition Keion White to trip him up for a loss of 1 yard. Instead of being in a first-and-goal situation with three timeouts, the Eagles were stuck in second-and-long and didn't pick up a single yard the rest of the way.

Against a 49ers team that has been battered by injuries and lost George Kittle to a season-ending torn Achilles in the first half, it was notable how the Eagles suffered when their weaker starters and depth players were brought into focus. The 49ers hit a pair of big plays in the first half when the deep safety in the middle of the field -- first Marcus Epps, then Reed Blankenship -- was simply unable to slow down a receiver and allowed significant yards after the catch in the process. Those plays amounted to 106 of San Francisco's 186 yards in the first half, setting it up for 10 points.

Blankenship simply stopped running on a trick play, with Christian McCaffreyzooming by him to catch a touchdown pass from receiverJauan Jennings. Nakobe Dean couldn't hang in coverage on McCaffrey for the winning touchdown. Fred Johnson, playing right tackle for the injured Lane Johnson, committed a false start that pushed the Eagles backward on third down and allowed the only sack of the game for Philly's offense. When you consider what the 49ers got from guys such asEric Kendricks, Garret Wallowand Demarcus Robinson on Sunday, the gap between the marginal players taking meaningful snaps on the two rosters and how they played was significant.

Is that on coaching? It has to be, at least in part. Kyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh did an excellent job of getting the most out of the talent they had, a job that became even more difficult for the 49ers head coach when Kittle went down early in the game and took a part of the playbook with him. The Niners were able to find answers by repeatedly targetingAdoree' Jacksonand attacking the Eagles underneath, where Philly blew coverages and couldn't get close as it tried to tackle McCaffrey and Kyle Juszczyk at times.

Saleh's defense leaned into the blitz, trusting that Hurts and Philly's two star wideouts wouldn't be able to make them pay. That plan paid off, as Hurts went 6-of-11 for just 48 yards against the blitz. Even when the 49ers didn't send the house, the threat of the blitz caused the Eagles to question their looks and check into plays that weren't necessarily great fits for what the 49ers ran post-snap. And after Deommodore Lenoir blew contain on the second run of the game and allowed Saquon Barkley to run for 29 yards, the 49ers limited the Philly run game to 109 yards on 34 carries, or 3.2 yards per pop.

For the majority of this season, it has seemed like the Eagles believed they were going to win on sheer talent, that their stars would make more big plays than yours. There was nothing to fix with the run game, because this had been one of the best offensive lines in football with Lane Johnson on the field. Brown and Smith were uncoverable at their best. Hurts was a serial winner. The Eagles ran one of the most static pre-snap offenses in football and were comfortable with Hurts attacking blitzes with low-percentage throws downfield because they believed their guys were going to win.

The results spoke for themselves until they didn't, and the core of general manager Howie Roseman's Eagles teams -- the offensive and defensive lines -- wasn't up to the task. The Eagles went 8-2 with Lane Johnson and 3-5 without him, as the legendary right tackle never made it back from his midseason Lisfranc injury. Hurts posted a 64.3 QBR with Johnson on the field and a 49.7 mark without him. The Eagles were the league's fifth-worst rushing attack in terms of success rate without Johnson. His absence wasn't the only issue, as Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens both struggled through frustrating seasons, but the Eagles simply didn't have the same dominant O-line that they had in 2024, and they never really found a way to account or adjust for those issues.

And while Roseman hit on the midseason addition of Jaelan Phillips, who gave an inconsistent pass rush a much-needed boost of pressure, the Eagles' offseason moves didn't necessarily age well. Zack Baun wasn't the same linebacker in his second season with Philadelphia and got juked out of the play several times in the loss to the 49ers. Some of the depth guys brought in to replace the departed Josh Sweat, such as Za'Darius Smith, Joshua Ucheand Azeez Ojulari, struggled to make an impact amid injuries (and an unexpected retirement for Smith). First-round pick Jihaad Campbell lost his role in the lineup once Dean returned from injury and played just one defensive snap against the Niners. The next defenders off the board were Carson Schwesinger, who is a Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate in Cleveland, and Nick Emmanwori, who has been a physical force at safety for Seattle.

But at the end of the day, this has to fall on the coaching staff, specifically the offensive brain trust of head coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. The Eagles simply didn't develop any new answers as the season went along, and while we don't know how things would have gone if Lane Johnson had actually made it back, the Eagles' offense wasn't really all that great with him in the fold, either. It certainly wasn't up to what we saw last season, when Kellen Moore was in Patullo's role and merged the offense he ran in Dallas and Los Angeles with what the Eagles ran under Sirianni.

Should the Eagles fire Sirianni? I laid out many of the pros and cons for him in November, and there's no arguing that his résumé through five seasons is essentially unprecedented in modern football. He deserves some credit for how well things went in 2022 and 2024, and some blame for the disappointing endings in 2023 and 2025. The Eagles could try to bring back former special teams coordinator John Harbaugh, but Ravens fans would have many of the same complaints about their former coach that Eagles fans have about their current leader.

I'd be surprised if the Eagles moved on from Sirianni. It's tough to see Patullo returning, and given that Moore and Shane Steichen have earned head coaching gigs from running this offense, it should be an appealing opportunity for offensive minds. It would seem aggressive to make massive personnel changes, but Roseman has never shied away from making moves before. And I wonder whether the Eagles will look to potentially tradeA.J. Brown, who had his least efficient season as an Eagles player, repeatedly seemed to butt heads with the organization and turns 29 in June.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Lost 27-24 vs. Bills

After what has been an excellent debut season as a head coach in Jacksonville, I'm worried Liam Coen is going to be sick for weeks. The Jaguars let this game get away from them in a way that I would not have anticipated. On a day whenTrevor Lawrence struggled with consistency and went 18-of-30 for 207 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions, the Jags simply didn't run the ball often enough.

It's one thing to get away from the run when an offense doesn't have success or is facing a team that has a solid run defense, but neither of those things were true. The Bills' rush defense -- which ranked 31st in EPA per play against designed runs -- was their obvious weakness heading into the game. And the Jaguars boomed on the ground on their first touchdown drive, as Bhayshul Tuten racked up consecutive carries of 20, 14 and 13 yards. Inexplicably, the rookie got just one carry the rest of the way.

The duo of Tuten andTravis Etienne Jr.combined for just 14 carries, which they turned into 118 yards and a 71% success rate. By EPA per designed rush by running backs, this was the 13th-most-efficient rushing performance of the season in any game by any set of backs. The Jags simply didn't get to it enough.

Raw rush totals can be misleading. Lawrence kept on a zone-read on fourth-and-short when he would have handed the ball off if Joey Bosa hadn't crashed down. Teams can run RPOs and throw their way out of run looks if they get the right movement. We saw the Panthers throw a pair of slants to Tetairoa McMillan that were tagged onto their run plays for easy completions. And if a defense is loading up with heavy boxes and daring teams to throw, running for the sake of running isn't a good idea.

But the Bills weren't doing that. The Jags didn't run into a single loaded box with Etienne or Tuten all game. Nine of those 14 carries went into light boxes, which helped their efficiency and hinted toward how the Bills were willing to approach this game on defense. Looking at Lawrence's first-and-10 dropbacks that weren't near the goal line or in the two-minute drill, there were plenty of run-friendly boxes that the Jags chose not to hit.

Given how Lawrence played Sunday, that was a missed opportunity. He came into the postseason on fire and playing the best football of his career, but as I highlighted last week, that doesn't always lead to the same success in the postseason.

Lawrence had a 15-2 touchdown-interception ratio during the final nine games of the 2022 season, then threw five picks in two playoff games, including four in the Jags' dramatic comeback win over the Chargers. After posting a 15-1 ratio over the final six games of 2025, Lawrence threw two picks in Sunday's loss, including one on the first play of the season-ending drive. He failed to convert on the aforementioned fourth-and-2 zone-read attempt, as well. Lawrence still made a handful of nice throws, especially when targeting slot receiver Parker Washington, but his 30.2 Total QBR ranked ninth among the 10 quarterbacks who have played in the wild-card round so far.

While the Jags led 24-20 with 4:03 to go after Lawrence found Etienne for a touchdown, the Josh Allen drive that followed felt almost inevitable. The Jaguars have a solid defense, but their secondary needs the pass rush to create problems. Instead, Allen went 9-of-12 for 144 yards under pressure, including a spectacular throw against an unblocked rusher to Brandin Cooks on a post route for 36 yards, which got the Bills into the red zone for the game-winning touchdown.

Even as Allen completed passes to nine different receivers and top target Khalil Shakir was mostly catching screens and hitches, the Bills were able to attack outside cornerbacks Jarrian Jones andGreg Newsome IIin coverage. Jones also struggled with his tackling after the catch. Allen was 10-of-11 on out-breaking routes, repeatedly trusting his ability to throw the ball into places Jacksonville's defenders couldn't reach. And to mitigate the pass rush, Allen got the ball out in less than 2.5 seconds on nearly half of his attempts, going 16-of-17 for 173 yards and a touchdown on those throws.

This was a successful year for the Jaguars, but I'm not sure it went the way Coen and first-year general manager James Gladstone would have imagined. Gladstone swore to take big swings in his new role, and some of those swings hit. Jakobi Meyers was wildly successful after being acquired at the trade deadline, earning an extension. Slot corner Jourdan Lewis was excellent early in the season before hitting injured reserve twice. Center Robert Hainsey had a very solid year after following Coen over from Tampa Bay.

And yet some of the more high-profile moves the Jags made didn't really work out. Newsome, acquired in a midseason trade for Tyson Campbell, allowed a107.5 passer ratingin coverage. Dyami Brown, signed to a one-year, $10 million deal, racked up 227 receiving yards and was a healthy scratch late in the year. Really, much of the new regime's success came in getting more out of the players who were already in the building, includingCole Van Lanen, Devin Lloyd, Etienne, Lawrence and Arik Armstead--all of whom played much better in 2025.

The biggest move the Jags made, of course, was trading two first-round picks for hybrid uber-prospect Travis Hunter. The early returns on that move aren't looking great. Hunter didn't play like a first-rounder at wide receiver or cornerback, although he did have 101 yards against the Rams in his final game before suffering a season-ending knee injury in practice. The Jaguars didn't seem to have a consistent usage plan for Hunter, and while the first-rounder they sent to the Browns to acquire him will fall late in the first round at No. 24, I'm not sure that trade looks all that great after one season.

Hunter still deserves time to develop, and the Jags surely would have loved to have him at cornerback against the Bills on Sunday, but their future plans for him could determine what happens this offseason. It seems likely that the Jags will move forward with Hunter playing regularly at cornerback, where they'll have an opening, especially if Newsome is allowed to hit free agency.

What about wide receiver, though? In Hunter's absence, the Jaguars got their passing game going by getting two other wideouts on the field. Meyers emerged as a standout, but so did Washington, who produced a mammoth run of games down the stretch. Underappreciated frankly by both the current and prior regimes in Jacksonville, Washington was buried on the depth chart after the additions of Hunter, Brown and Meyers.

Once Hunter was injured and Brown was taken out of the lineup, though, Washington proved that he belongs on the field. He had 145 receiving yards in the Jags' December win over the Broncos, then followed with a 115-yard day against the Colts and 87 yards against the Titans. Washington was then the Jags' leading receiver on Sunday, turning a team-high 12 targets into 107 yards and a touchdown. With one more year left on his rookie deal, Washington has earned a regular role in the lineup when Jacksonville is in three-wide sets.

The investment made in Hunter also implies that he's going to be a part of the offense, which leaves me with questions about the one player I haven't mentioned.Brian Thomas Jr.came into the year as Jacksonville's top wideout after an impressive rookie season, but amid early issues with drops, he seemed to fade out of that lead role in the offense. Meyers and Washington took over as Lawrence's top target for stretches in the second half. Thomas averaged 46.6 receiving yards per game over the final eight games of the season, and despite an early touchdown catch for Jacksonville's first score Sunday, he finished with only two receptions for 21 yards.

The new regime inherited Thomas, and he didn't appear a natural fit in Year 1 with Coen. Would the Jaguars consider trading him? The 2024 first-rounder is the most natural fit as the ""X"" receiver in Coen's offense, and I'm not sure any of the other guys are obvious replacements for him in that role. Plus, Thomas was so talented as a rookie that I'd want to try to make it work for another season.

If the Jags can recoup the first-round pick they sent away for Hunter, though, trading Thomas might be worth serious consideration. And the obvious landing spot, coincidentally enough, would be with the team that just beat them. Buffalo doesn't have that young playmaker who can win against man coverage at wide receiver, and Thomas would be a major upgrade on what already appears to be a failed experiment in Keon Coleman. The Bills will also have their first-rounder fall toward the end of the round, which would probably be a fair price for Thomas. It's an unlikely move, of course, but Jacksonville has four starters for three wideout spots, and Thomas is the player who would have the most trade value and who the Jags have seen the least out of in 2025.

A notable starter whose future is more likely to be elsewhere in 2026 is Walker Little. The prior front office signed the 2021 second-round pick to a three-year, $40.5 million deal after just a handful of starts at left tackle. Little began the year on Lawrence's blind side, but when he suffered a concussion in a November win over the Titans, the Jags installed Van Lanen at left tackle. The utility player was enough of an upgrade that the Jags signed him to a three-year, $51 million deal and kept him at left tackle when Little returned. (Little moved to right guard to take over for the injured Patrick Mekari.)

Van Lanen missed Sunday's loss with a knee injury, with Little back to his old spot and committing two false starts. The commitment to Van Lanen suggests that the Jags see him as a left tackle candidate in 2026. With Little's $11 million base salary guaranteed next season, it would hardly be a surprise if the Jaguars traded him to clear out a starting spot and get some cash to put toward free agent additions this offseason.

Green Bay Packers

Lost 31-27 vs. Bears

Sunday's loss brought an end to a five-week collapse for the Packers, who walked off the field after Keisean Nixon's interception sealed a win over the Bears in early December with hopes of winning the NFC North. That dramatic victory was their last of the season, as the Packers lost their final five games, including the wild-card matchup Saturday. Along the way, they lost Micah Parsonsto a knee injury, lost (then regained) Jordan Loveto a concussionand blew two different games with a 95% or better win expectancy in the fourth quarter to the Bears. The first pushed the NFC North back to Chicago, and the second might have ended Matt LaFleur's run as Green Bay's head coach.

There has been smoke around the coach's future in Green Bay over the past few weeks, and there are plans to talk after the season about extending the contracts of LaFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst, both of whom are entering the final year of their respective pacts. I'd argue that they're two of the best at their respective roles. I'm just not sure Packers fans would agree with that sentiment at the moment.

At halftime of Saturday night's game, of course, LaFleur looked like he might earn a new deal in the locker room. It seemed like the Packers had outprepared, outschemed and outplayed the Bears, who were flailing on fourth downs and struggling to live up to the moment. Chicago coach Ben Johnson wasn't able to get his ground game going, had dialed up just one play-action pass for Caleb Williamsand couldn't rely at all on his defense to slow down the Packers. Love and the Green Bay offense scored touchdowns on their first three drives, and while Brandon McManus missed a 55-yard field goal to end the half, the Packers were up 21-3 and getting the ball to start the third quarter. One missed kick wasn't going to matter, right?

Well, three missed kicks mattered, as McManus missed another field goal and an extra point, costing the Packers seven points in a game they lost by four. He was a savior for the Packers last season when he produced an outlier season in terms of accuracy, but the Packers brought McManus back for 2025 with underwhelming results; he had the fifth-worst field goals made over expectation (per NFL Next Gen Stats) of any kicker, even before his postseason disappointment. Would he have had a better chance of making those kicks at home?

The Bears found their rhythm on offense, as they scored on five of their six possessions in the second half, racking up 333 net yards and 28 points. The Packers, decidedly, did not. The offense went to sleep for its first four possessions in the second half, as Green Bay amassed 29 yards and one first down across a four-drive stretch.

Much of that owed to a rushing attack that simply stopped. Josh Jacobs was solid early in this game, but the 2024 free agent addition and the offensive line could not conspire to threaten the line of scrimmage for most of the contest. Jacobs finished with 19 carries for 55 yards, but his final 14 totes produced just 16 yards and one first down. Jacobs was stopped on a second-and-3, a third-and-1 and two carries from the 1-yard line. And pressed into action as a kickoff returner, he fumbled, with the Packers fortunate to fall on the football. Jacobs was returning from a knee injury, but if he wasn't 100 percent, it was on LaFleur to find other solutions, either by using other backs or leaning into the pass on early downs.

Jeff Hafley has earned head coaching consideration for his work with the Packers' defense over the past two years, but this also wasn't his best showing. The Packers were able to get off the field on fourth down against the Bears in the first half, but frankly, that was more a product of Chicago's clumsiness than great defensive play. Bears center Drew Dalman fired a snap wide of Williams to throw off the timing on one failed fourth-down play, while Dalman and right guard Jonah Jackson failed to block defensive tackle Karl Brooks on another, allowing the Packers lineman to run totally unbothered up the A-gap at Williams for a drive-ending pressure. Williams finished the first half 8-of-17 for 78 yards with an interception, and it seemed like Hafley might finish the night with a head coaching offer or two.

After the break, Hafley's defense wasn't able to consistently slow down the Bears. The Packers weren't able to create post-snap problems for Williams and the passing game. There's nothing wrong with rotation safeties and trying to show a different post-snap look, but it led to snaps in which the Packers weren't in position to succeed. On the first third down of the third quarter, the Packers showed a two-high look before the snap and then blitzed safetyXavier McKinney from 11 yards off the line of scrimmage. McKinney never got close to Williams, and the Packers were outnumbered on a flood combination to that side of the field, producing an easy 19-yard completion to tight endColston Loveland.

Loveland picked up another big play on the same drive when the Packers spun their safeties before the snap and nobody ran with his crossing route. The rookie tight end was a mismatch when the Packers did get somebody on him -- Loveland was simply too athletic for Quay Walker--but the Packers made their own mistakes. On a critical third-and-4 before the winning touchdown, the Packers responded to an empty formation by dropping their defensive backs past the sticks and asking edge rusher Kingsley Enagbare to get into the flat to cover running backD'Andre Swift. Williams went right to Swift for an easy 23-yard gain. One play later, the Bears had the lead.

That final play saw the Bears take advantage of the position that has been the weak spot on the Packers' roster since the start of the season. Carrington Valentine was supposed to be booted out of the starting lineup by the arrival of free agent slot corner Nate Hobbs, but Hobbs was ineffective and injured for most of his debut season in Green Bay. Valentine has allowed a121.2 passer ratingin his stead, and he came up lacking on the last snap of the Packers' season.

For all the complaints about Ben Johnson's playcalling being too cute, this was an example of the details selling the right lie to the right player. The Bears lined up with trips to the left and an unbalanced line, giving them an extra blocker to the side of the field in tackle Darnell Wright. The look screamed some sort of screen, and early in the game, the Bears had thrown a screen on third-and-8 out of that same bunch for a first down.

This time, though, the Bears were taking a shot downfield. Williams fired his hips toward the tunnel screen without ever really throwing the ball, but that was enough. Valentine drove on the screen, and by the time he turned around, the ball was already coming out.DJ Moorehad dropped a spectacular throw from Williams earlier in the drive, but this time, the wide-open veteran brought in a fade for the winning touchdown.

Injuries and absences mattered. LinebackerEdgerrin Cooper leaving in the third quarter because of an ankle injury cost the Packers arguably their best remaining player on the defense. Isaiah McDuffie filled in and wasn't able to tackle Bears running backKyle Monangai on a critical checkdown that turned into a 22-yard completion and set up a touchdown. LinebackerNick Niemann, who hadn't played a single defensive snap all season, was isolated in coverage against Loveland on the 2-point try that made it a three-point game.

And the Packers sorely missed Parsons, the player for whom Gutekunst sent two first-round picks to acquire. They pressured Williams on 25% of his dropbacks, but the Packers had just two quick pressures on 48 opportunities, meaning that most of the times they bothered Williams came late in the play. Parsons averaged more than two quick pressures per game on his own this season. Could those pressures have helped swing this game toward Green Bay?

The Packers did have a chance to win the game after the Moore touchdown, but sloppy game management from LaFleur limited what they could do. It's always easier to evaluate timeout usage after the fact, when we know how the game ends, but it's impossible to suggest that LaFleur got anything close to full value for the three he had in the second half.

Green Bay used its first on offense with 3:02 left, a stopped clock and a three-point lead to avoid a delay of game penalty. That's fine, but the Packers promptly went back to the line after the timeout and took a delay of game penalty, costing them 5 yards. After an incompletion on third down, LaFleur had the impossible choice between kicking a field goal to go up six (often seen as a net negative by win expectancy models, because it incentivizes the other team to go for a touchdown) or attempt a fourth-and-15. He got neither, and the Bears scored a touchdown anyway.

LaFleur had to use his second timeout on defense with 2:08 to go, this time because the Packers couldn't get the right players on the field. The timeout stopped the clock for the Bears and gave them the ability to open up the playbook to call a run just before the two-minute warning, which they took advantage of to pick up 5 yards.

The Packers were left with one timeout for their final drive, which they used after a short competition to Romeo Doubs. They were then forced to run 10 seconds off the clock after an injury to center Sean Rhyan. In the end, they never even got an opportunity to run a play within the red zone before time expired, coming closest when Love nearly squeezed a pass between three Tampa 2 defenders toChristian Watsoninside the 5-yard line.

It's a frustrating loss at the end of a frustrating losing streak. It's the third straight year the Packers have entered the postseason as the 7-seed, and LaFleur has a grand total of one playoff win over the past five seasons. Should what Packers fans saw from their coach Saturday serve as proof that Green Bay needs to go in a different direction?

I would say no. LaFleur has gone 76-40-1 as a head coach despite fielding what were often underwhelming defenses over that stretch, an issue I would blame more on Joe Barry than him. There have been a couple of rough losses in the postseason, and I'm not sure I'll ever understand LaFleur kicking a field goal down eight late against the Bucs with the greatest red zone offense in league history in the 2020 playoffs, but there's a real value in having a coach who gets you to the playoffs just about every year. LaFleur's work with Malik Willis and building a functional offense around a quarterback who looked unplayable in Tennessee is a testament to his offensive mind.

The story seems the same for the Packers because it is the same. They're a good team stuck in a tough division. They're the youngest team in the league on an annual basis, as Gutekunst strips the oldest players from the roster and loads up on draft picks. The difference was supposed to be Parsons, the true superstar who would elevate the rest of the defense, help mask the weaknesses at cornerback and come up with big plays when the Packers needed them most. And for three-plus months, Parsons lived up to expectations. There's no good time to tear an ACL, but Parsons doing so one month before the playoffs was always going to have a dramatic impact on Green Bay's ceiling. I wouldn't fire LaFleur or Gutekunst because their most important addition tore an ACL.

Instead, I suspect it will be an offseason of retooling. This offseason might be the end of the line in Green Bay for 30-year-old lineman Elgton Jenkins, who has a $24.8 million cap hit next season. Hobbs and 28-year-old guard Aaron Banks, who was in and out of the lineup because of injuries, could be one-and-done in Green Bay, although I'd be surprised if Banks was released. Doubs, who had a fantastic catch in a key moment, is likely to leave in free agency, which will help the Packers recoup some of the draft capital they lost as part of the Parsons deal via compensatory picks. The Packers were also 26th in special teams win probability during the regular season, which might create problems for coordinator Rich Bisaccia.

Outside of the very top teams in football, a lot of organizations would and should look enviously at what the Packers have built. I think we need to see what that looks like in the postseason with a healthy Parsons before making any sort of snap judgments about whether Green Bay is better off with another head coach.

Carolina Panthers

Lost 34-31 vs. Rams

There are no moral victories in the playoffs, but for the Panthers, this might have been the closest thing to one. They were massive underdogs at home even after beating the Rams in Carolina this season, and expectations of repeating that feat in the rematch were low. When the Panthers quickly went down 14-0 after a failed fourth-down conversion and a Bryce Young interception handed the Rams a pair of short fields, a blowout victory for Los Angeles appeared to be on the horizon.

Instead, the Panthers came all the way back to take the lead with 2:39 to go before the defense allowed the game-winning touchdown drive toMatthew Stafford. The veteran quarterback reportedly told receiverDavante Adams he was going to ""snatch [ the Panthers' ] hearts"" on the final drive. A cold line, no doubt, but one you save for the Super Bowl when you know the NFL Films microphones are on the sideline, right? Stafford had to pull out his best material late in the wild-card round, both on and off the field, to get the Rams to the next round.

I'm weirdly more optimistic about the Panthers after their playoff loss than I was after their win over the Rams in Week 13, because the factors that led to that win were unsustainable. The Panthers converted all three of their fourth-down tries, including two for long touchdown passes. With a Mike Jackson pick-six leading the way, the Panthers posted a plus-three turnover margin in the win; the last time that happened was in the Matt Rhule era with Baker Mayfield at quarterback, more than three years ago. Those plays matter and are meaningful, but I'm not sure they're particularly sustainable as a formula for beating the Rams.

And in those same spots Sunday, the Panthers' timing wasn't quite as impeccable. They went 0-for-3 on fourth down. Young threw an early pick to the Rams on a play in which Panthers receiverJalen Coker, who otherwise had a breakout game, seemed to be on the wrong page after some pre-snap adjustments and stopped his route. Carolina rookie Trevor Etienne muffed a punt to give the Rams another short field, and while the Panthers got another Jackson interception and blocked a punt in the fourth quarter, the turnover margin for this game went down in Los Angeles' favor.

Instead, this Panthers performance shined through the full 60 minutes, as they went toe-to-toe with the Rams on a down-by-down basis. They struggled early on defense, with Rams receiverPuka Nacua moving around the formation and flummoxing Carolina's zone coverage looks, but defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero and his cornerbacks held up against Nacua and Adams and forced Stafford into what seemed like an endless run of contested throws to either sideline. They rode their luck a bit when Nacua dropped a would-be touchdown just before halftime, but the Panthers were able to limit explosive rushing plays and didn't allow a single drive over 50 yards before the fourth quarter.

And on a day whenChuba Hubbard and Rico Dowdle combined for 55 yards on 18 carries and the Panthers trailed by 14 points midway through the first quarter, so much of the game fell on Young's shoulders. His offensive line was a mess. Guard Robert Hunt tried to return early from a pectoral injury and clearly wasn't his usual self. The Panthers lost left tackle Ikem Ekwonu to a ruptured patellar tendon early in the game, and replacement Yosh Nijman allowed four of the 14 quick pressures generated by the Rams (per NFL Next Gen Stats), which tied for the fifth-most quick pressures in any game all season.

Under the circumstances, I thought Young was excellent. The raw numbers aren't going to wow anyone, with the 2023 No. 1 draft pick completing 52.5% of his passes and averaging 6.6 yards per attempt, but his 74.4 Total QBR attests to how well he played given the pressure rate. He was repeatedly able to buy time and create out of structure, looking almost Tony Romo-esque as he spun his way out of interior pressure and got out of the pocket to find receivers.

When Young wasn't pressured, he went 17-of-24 for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick. He threw with anticipation to set up two chunk plays to Coker, who finished with nine catches for 134 yards and the touchdown that gave the Panthers their fourth-quarter lead. Young is never going to have the strongest arm, so he needs to anticipate voids before they come open, throw accurate passes to create YAC and create out of structure. He did all three Saturday.

I'm not suggesting that Young's fifth-year option was on the line in this game, because the indications were already that the Panthers were going to pick up Young's $26.5 million guarantee for 2027. If Young had suffered through a disastrous game (think Sam Darnold's final start with the Vikings), though, that pickup might have come through gritted teeth. This was Young's most important start in a Panthers uniform, and he came through impressively.

This is the first offseason in many years in which the Panthers won't have to make fixing the offense their primary focus. Acquiring a quarterback was problem No. 1, and they've spent the past two offseasons desperately trying to get the right players around Young. Some of those moves haven't hit, but enough have left the offense in solid shape. Coker and presumptive Offensive Rookie of the Year Tetairoa McMillan are the two young wideouts the Panthers have been hoping to find. They'll also have Jonathon Brooks as the second back alongside Hubbard to replace Dowdle next season.

There's still work to be done, of course. Ekwonu is likely out six to 12 months, and the Panthers are on the hook for his $17.6 million fifth-year option in 2026. Nijman, a pending free agent, was a turnstile when forced into the lineup at left tackle, so the Panthers probably need a short-term stopgap there if Ekwonu is not ready to go. Adding a tight end might also be on the docket if the Panthers weren't impressed by Ja'Tavion Sanders' second season.

But really, this should be an offseason finally devoted toward adding defense. The Panthers signed Tershawn Wharton and Tre'von Moehrig in free agency, but when they used a second-round pick on edge Nic Scourton, it marked the first time Carolina had used a first- or second-round pick on a defensive player since selecting Jaycee Horn in 2021.

The Panthers like their young talent on defense, but this would be about finding more significant solutions for some of their veterans on short-term, low-cost contracts. Ironically, two are former Rams in safetyNick Scottand linebacker Christian Rozeboom, both of whom were targeted by L.A. in coverage Sunday. No Carolina defender managed more than five sacks, so finding a veteran (or a first-round pick) on the edge who can create more pass pressure alongside Scourton and Princely Umanmielen would be a welcome addition.

It's important to be realistic about where the Panthers are and what they've shown. This team finished 25th in DVOA and ESPN's Football Power Index. It was 8-9 against one of the league's easier schedules, the same performance that led the Falcons to fire Raheem Morris after two seasons in Atlanta. And after no-showing in a win-and-in game against the Buccaneers last week, the Panthers needed Morris and his Falcons to beat the Saints (something they weren't able to do in their two meetings) to back into the postseason.

And yet there are meaningful signs of growth. The Panthers finished 21st in weighted DVOA, and while that's not going to push coach Dave Canales into the Hall of Fame, it's a sign that they were improving as the season went along. They beat the Packers and Rams and came within a defensive stop of beating what might be the league's best team a second time. If they can stack a second effective offseason in a row, the Panthers might be in position to take over Tampa Bay's spot as the presumptive favorite in the NFC South in the years to come.

ID31,New York Public Library,2026-01-12 13:28:44+00:00,United States Patent and Trademark Office,Lighting the way | USPTO,Not Available,,,,,https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/journeys-innovation/statue-of-liberty,"In 1871, reeling from the aftermath of this conflict, Bartholdi made the decision to travel to the United States.
Purportedly, Bartholdi imagined the “majestic figure of Liberty towering with her torch” and “lighting the crowded harbor, with its tributary rivers and the vast, blackened cities on their borders, the very image of a teeming, populous miniature world.” America, however, had some practical concerns.
Design patent protection was extremely well-suited for Bartholdi’s goals.
And design patents were considered fairly straightforward to apply for and receive, a characteristic reflected in Bartholdi’s patent application files.
The patent for the statue’s bust was granted on November 5, less than a month after the application was submitted.","In 1865, the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment abolished the institution of slavery in the United States. Following these world-changing events, French political thinker and abolitionist Edouard de Laboulaye first proposed presenting a monument to the United States to commemorate this triumph of human freedom. De Laboulaye intended for the monument itself to be a gift from France, a gesture of friendship between two nations who fought side-by-side in the war for American independence nearly a century prior. A strong advocate for democracy, he also hoped the monument would spark anew a desire for freedom among the people of France.

Bartholdi’s first proposed location for his massive statue was the newly opened Suez Canal, and although this project never progressed beyond sketches, his depiction of a female figure on a pedestal holding a torch aloft struck familiar notes. After more than a decade focusing on artistic endeavors and attempts to find a potential home for such a structure, Bartholdi’s work was interrupted by his duties as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War. He watched as his home region was annexed by Germany and his nation was thrown into political turmoil. In 1871, reeling from the aftermath of this conflict, Bartholdi made the decision to travel to the United States. Prior to his trip, he met with de Laboulaye, and the pair reaffirmed their now joint goal to convince both France and America to support and finance the statue.

Bartholdi had multiple goals for his trip to America, but one of the most important was to scout prospective locations for the statue. An 1886 article in The Columbian described the sculptor’s “moment of inspiration,” which came on a “beautiful spring morning” while he was a passenger on a steamship traveling into New York Bay. Purportedly, Bartholdi imagined the “majestic figure of Liberty towering with her torch” and “lighting the crowded harbor, with its tributary rivers and the vast, blackened cities on their borders, the very image of a teeming, populous miniature world.”

America, however, had some practical concerns. A handbook produced by Statue of Liberty National Monument cites a few potential reasons for the lack of enthusiasm amongst Americans for funding the pedestal. Some took issue with the Statue’s proposed location, either believing discussion should be opened to alternative cities or unwilling to donate their money for what they viewed as a statue for New York City alone. Others, however, struggled to believe that the behemoth statue would ever be completed. With the statue being constructed an ocean away, Bartholdi found that his sketches and scale models were not enough to capture American confidence.

During the month that Bartholdi displayed the statue at the Centennial Exposition, he also sold photographs and even scrap metal from the torch in order to raise funds for the pedestal. The nation’s press took notice, with coverage of Bartholdi’s visit found in newspapers from Massachusetts, Ohio, Wisconsin, and of course, New York. In a letter to the editor in the New York Tribune, one citizen asked how to subscribe to help raise funds for the pedestal, proclaiming, “We should consider it an honor and a privilege to each contribute our share of the cost... What better memorial of the Centennial year could Americans inaugurate than this!”

The Centennial Exposition officially ended on November 10, 1876, but fundraising for the pedestal continued. For the next six years, the arm and torch found a home in New York’s Madison Square Park. In January of 1877, the statue’s advocates formed the American Committee of the Statue of Liberty. When Bartholdi returned to France to supervise the construction of the rest of his colossus, he designated the Committee’s secretary, Richard Butler, as his proxy in the United States. Looking to capitalize on the success of mementos from the Centennial, the Committee began selling scale models and photographs of the Statue in order to raise funds. However, this presented a new conundrum.

One tool Bartholdi used to protect against copycats were design patents. A fairly new form of intellectual property protection at the time, design patents were first authorized by Congress in 1842 to protect an article of manufacture where the novelty and value was in its appearance rather than the function. Technological advances in manufacturing allowed for cast iron pieces, textiles, and statuary to be both more intricately designed and more efficiently produced, and the artisans creating these pieces lobbied for a way to protect their unique patterns and embellishments. By the time Bartholdi applied for his first patent, more than 1,000 design patents had been granted by the Patent Office.

Design patent protection was extremely well-suited for Bartholdi’s goals. As he was seeking to protect the design of the statuettes and images used for fundraising, rather than the statue itself, they were considered an article of manufacture, making any potential infringements easier to navigate. The fourteen-year limit on the protection afforded by the patents did not pose an issue, as Bartholdi’s goal was to raise the necessary funds as quickly as possible. And design patents were considered fairly straightforward to apply for and receive, a characteristic reflected in Bartholdi’s patent application files.

On October 16, 1878, Bartholdi submitted his first patent application for the design of an ornamental bust, retaining the services of a New York City law firm, S.H. Wales & Son, and paying the required fee of $45. His description highlights many of the statue’s familiar features, including the head “surmounted” by a “diadem, from which rays proceed,” the “eyes having a distant gaze,” and the statue’s countenance “with an air of dignity and determination, symbolic of Liberty and Enlightenment.”

Bartholdi’s attorneys submitted a single amendment on October 22. Apparently, Bartholdi had originally used only his last name to sign the patent petition, and it was a requirement of the Patent Office that an inventor’s full name be included. The anglicized spelling of “August” was subsequently scrawled in red pencil anywhere Bartholdi’s name appeared.

The patent for the statue’s bust was granted on November 5, less than a month after the application was submitted. Bartholdi must have found the process and benefits of patent protection effective, for he submitted a second patent application for the full statue just months later, on January 2, 1879.

On January 14, the patent examiner assigned the patent wrote to Bartholdi with his objections. The first was a matter of word choice; Bartholdi had initially written “the design may be executed in whole or in part glyptically,” and the examiner stated that the word “glyptically” was “not to be found in the English language.” This line was amended to “any manner known to the glyptic art” in the final version. The examiner also asked Bartholdi to make one of his claims more specific. As it was written, they found the works more aligned with the “proper subject matter of copyright and not of letters patent.” In response, Bartholdi’s attorneys submitted their amendments, and the design for a statue was patented on February 18.

Nationalizing the fundraising drive while keeping the interest of the New Yorkers, who were consistently providing the majority of the funds, was one of the main challenges of the Committee. At various times during the statue’s construction, other cities around the nation expressed interest in providing a home for Lady Liberty within their borders. Bartholdi used this to his advantage, cleverly motivating New Yorkers by implying that Philadelphia might be permitted to keep the statue if they did not raise the necessary funds. And when Boston tossed themselves into the arena as an option, it ignited a rivalry between the two cities, both steeped in Revolutionary War history. A New York Times article in 1882 responded to Boston’s offer, leaving little of the city’s sentiment up for interpretation: “We have more than a million people in this City who are resolved that that great light-house shall be smashed into minute fragments before it shall be stuck up in Boston Harbor.”

When sales of the statuettes slowed and the pedestal was still nowhere near completion, the statue’s champions turned to other creative fundraising avenues. In 1883, the Pedestal Fund Art Loan Exhibition launched, a collection of paintings, sculptures, musical instruments, costumes, furniture, literary works, and items for daily use. “In assembling the rare and carefully selected Loan Collection,” the Committee’s goals were to ensure the funding of the pedestal was an endeavor “not one community alone, but the entire nation, should feel an interest,” as well as “awakening among us a potent influence in art.”

Fundraising ebbed once again in 1885, when it was determined that another $100,000 would be needed to complete the pedestal. At that point, Joseph Pulitzer, the editor of the newspaper The New York World, took up the cause. Soliciting donations from everyone from schoolchildren to the richest captains of industry, Pulitzer was able to help harness the excitement of the statue’s arrival from France. It arrived at its permanent home of Bedloe’s Island on June 19, awaiting only the pedestal’s completion.",https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/joi0126_lead.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 09:13:44.124222

Health care employment also continued its upward trend in December, rising by 21,000 jobs, including a gain of 16,000 in hospitals.","The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 50,000 in December 2025, missing the 73,000 Dow Jones estimate and slowing from November’s revised gain of 56,000. November payrolls were revised down by 8,000 jobs, while October’s loss deepened to 173,000 from 105,000. For 2025 as a whole, payrolls grew by an average of 49,000 jobs per month, down sharply from 168,000 in 2024.

Bank of America Global Research analysts wrote in a report on Friday that although payroll growth has slowed since June, the unemployment rate has risen by only about 11 basis points. The report noted, “We have been highlighting that tighter immigration restrictions are likely to play a bigger role in the slowdown in job growth this year.”

The unemployment rate is a key statistic for the Fed, and markets responded to Friday’s miss by pricing out a January rate cut, according to the analysts. Futures now imply less than half a cut priced in through April, which marks the end of Powell’s term.

The productivity factor

Despite weak job growth, forecasts still point to solid overall economic expansion. I asked Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, how the U.S. economy can continue to grow strongly while hiring softens.

“We’re seeing a clear decoupling between growth and hiring,” Daco said. Output is still expanding, but companies are generating that growth with fewer incremental workers and fewer hours.

“Productivity has rebounded meaningfully as businesses continue to streamline operations, automate processes, and extract more output from existing teams in a high-cost, high-interest-rate environment,” Daco explained. “This isn’t AI-led in a narrow sense yet—it’s the payoff from multi-year efficiency drives, tighter cost discipline, and delayed hiring.”

According to the BLS, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 4.9% in the third quarter of 2025, as output rose 5.4% while hours worked increased just 0.5%.

Areas of job growth

Where job growth has occurred, employment in food services and drinking places continued to trend higher in December, adding 27,000 jobs. The sector added an average of 12,000 jobs per month in 2025, roughly in line with the 11,000 average monthly gain in 2024.

Health care employment also continued its upward trend in December, rising by 21,000 jobs, including a gain of 16,000 in hospitals. Health care added an average of 34,000 jobs per month in 2025, down from an average monthly increase of 56,000 in 2024.

Monster’s newly released 2026 Job Market Outlook also reflects these pockets of strength. Based on full-year 2025 job posting and job seeker data, the report shows employer demand remaining firm in health care, essential services, infrastructure-related roles, and skill-based jobs, even as other parts of the labor market slow.

‘Hiring hasn’t stopped’

As private payroll growth weakened throughout 2025 and hiring appetites diminished, I asked Daco whether he expects that trend to continue amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and tariff-related risks

“Yes—barring a material improvement in policy clarity, I expect hiring restraint to persist,” he said. Private payroll growth has already slowed sharply as firms shift into cost-control mode, with geopolitical risks, tariff uncertainty, and elevated financing costs reinforcing that bias, he explained.

“Hiring hasn’t stopped, but it has become more selective and more conditional on clear demand visibility,” Daco added. “In this environment, CFOs are likely to continue favoring efficiency, automation, and capex discipline over broad-based workforce expansion.”

The latest S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that large U.S. corporate bankruptcies rose to one of the highest monthly totals in five years in December 2025, with filings increasing to 72 from 63 in November. This uptick extended the 15-year high for annual filings first set in November, bringing the total to 785 for the year—the highest since 2010. Rising interest rates have been a significant factor, as many companies struggled to refinance their debt, according to the report.

The data covers companies with public debt and at least $2 million in assets or liabilities, as well as private companies with at least $10 million in assets or liabilities at the time of filing.

Picking the right S&P 500 stocks requires more than just buying big names, and that’s where StockStory comes in. That said, here is one S&P 500 stock that is leading the market forward and two that may struggle.

Two Stocks to Sell:

Kraft Heinz (KHC)

Market Cap: $27.72 billion

The result of a 2015 mega-merger between Kraft and Heinz, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is a packaged foods giant whose products span coffee to cheese to packaged meat.

Why Do We Avoid KHC?

Declining unit sales over the past two years show it’s struggled to move its products and had to rely on price increases

Efficiency has decreased over the last year as its operating margin fell by 34.6 percentage points

ROIC of 1.2% reflects management’s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging

Kraft Heinz’s stock price of $23.44 implies a valuation ratio of 9.5x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why KHC doesn’t pass our bar.

Keysight (KEYS)

Market Cap: $35.62 billion

Spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 2014, Keysight (NYSE:KEYS) offers electronic measurement products for use in various sectors.

Why Does KEYS Give Us Pause?

New orders were hard to come by as its average backlog growth of 1.1% over the past two years underwhelmed

Earnings per share fell by 7.3% annually over the last two years while its revenue was flat, showing each sale was less profitable

Shrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability

Keysight is trading at $207.32 per share, or 25.6x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with KEYS, check out our full research report (it’s free).

One Stock to Buy:

ID21,IBM,2026-01-12 12:13:32+00:00,www.theregister.com,How CP/M-86's delay handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom - The Register,Liam Proven,,,,,https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/why_cpm86_was_late/,"The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that's what Trifunovic covers in detail.
You couldn't run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80.
86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.
It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M.
By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps.","A blog post by programmer Nemanja Trifunovic, The Late Arrival of 16-bit CP/M, is on the face of it an interesting little excursion into the late delivery of a long-forgotten bit of software – one that turned out to be pivotal for the entire computer industry.

It's the story of why the 16-bit version of Digital Research CP/M was late, but the delayed arrival of this now-obscure OS is what catalyzed the development of a different, but source-level compatible, OS. That OS started Microsoft on its way to its current $3.5 trillion capitalization, and is also what led to the development of OS/2, Windows, and indirectly Linux. There's a good chance that you already think you know how what happened, but if you reckon it's anything to do with DR's Gary Kildall being out flying a plane, that's not the true story, as The Register covered in 2011 (we'll get back to why not later in this piece). The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that's what Trifunovic covers in detail.

The CP/M-86 User Guide [PDF] bears a copyright year of 1981. The problem is it was designed for Intel's 8086 processor, and that shipped in 1978 – followed a year later by the budget model, the cut-down Intel 8088. In other words, the new edition of CP-M arrived about three years late. Its target, the 8086, was the exciting new 16-bit successor to the Intel 8080. As Intel's own page says:

It didn't revolutionize microprocessors – it created the microprocessor market.

This is no exaggeration, and a big reason it did so well was that it had a de facto standard OS: Digital Research's CP/M. CP/M was completely dominant. The early business microcomputer industry ran on it and essentially nothing else.

There was another processor that ran CP/M: Zilog's Z80. Although a fine chip and still mourned today, the Z80 was very much an eight-bit device, limited to a total of 64 KB of memory (RAM and ROM put together) without complicated bank switching.

As memory grew more affordable, what businesses needed was a partly compatible successor to the 8080 that could handle more of it. Intel delivered that with the 8086, which, rather than being limited to 64 KB, could handle 16 separate segments of 64 KB – for a total of one whole megabyte of memory space.

The problem was that, unlike the Z80, the 8086 was not binary compatible with the 8080. You couldn't run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80. To use the new chip, hundreds of thousands of CP/M users needed a new OS. DR originally promised it would deliver one by November 1979, but it didn't happen. Trifunovic's article explains why and how it slipped.

As a result, one of the hardware OEMs selling 8086 boards was more or less forced to develop its own independent, third-party-compatible OS. No, not Microsoft, and not IBM either. Back in 2007, Tim Paterson, the developer of that OS, wrote about how and why he did it. He called the result 86-DOS, and a couple of years ago, we covered the rediscovery of the oldest known version of that OS.

Paterson started work on 86-DOS in 1980 because CP/M-86 was already late. That was more than a year before IBM launched the first IBM PC – with the budget cut-down 8088, so it cost ""only"" $1,500.

As The Register put it back in 2011:

In fact, it's likely IBM selected CP/M-86 but was forced to look, at least temporarily, elsewhere as DR's effort to port CP/M to the Intel 8086/8088 CPU was taking longer than planned. Gates may well have pitched an alternative – IBM was already talking to Microsoft about using the latter's implementation of the Basic programming language – and appears to have won the deal in November 1980.

Not long after, Microsoft licensed 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products (SCP), specifically to sub-license the OS to IBM in turn. 86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.

In time, that made the fortune of Microsoft. Because IBM didn't get Microsoft to sign an exclusive deal, Microsoft was allowed to sell its DOS to whoever it wanted. That, together with cheaper IBM-compatible hardware, created the x86 PC industry.

The limitations of DOS, especially its memory management, are why Intel's successor chip, the 80286, was a bit of a flop. Although the 80286 had protected mode, which allowed it to support 16 MB of RAM and multitasking, this did little to help DOS — or IBM's new OS/2 1.0.

Here, too, DR missed out again. It had lost the deal to be the default OS on IBM's PC, but when Intel was developing the 80286, DR was ready for it.

It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M. It then added MS-DOS compatibility to create Concurrent DOS. The problem was that you can't fit many DOS apps into the 640 KB of RAM in an 8088 or 8086 PC.

So DR enhanced Concurrent DOS to make a native Intel 80286 OS. Concurrent DOS 286 was able to use up to 16 MB of RAM, and multitask lots of DOS apps in all that room (IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 1.0 wouldn't follow for over two more years, and still couldn't multitask DOS apps when it did).

The issue was that DR developed Concurrent DOS 286 on pre-release Intel 286 prototypes. Although the 80286 was released in 1982, it reached the PC market with IBM's new PC/AT in 1984. The problem was that the shipping version of the 80286 chip removed some features Concurrent DOS 286 needed.

By 1985, Intel released a new stepping of the 80286, which replaced the missing features, but the damage was done. Once again, this seriously damaged DR, but it recovered. It turned CDOS into a real-time OS, FlexOS 286. Versions of this remained on sale well into the 21st century, including IBM 4690 OS [PDF], Toshiba 4690 OS [PDF], and Siemens S5-DOS/MT [PDF].

DR also continued to work on its pre-Windows GUI desktop GEM (in its early days, The Reg covered the news of GEM going FOSS). Late last year, Mr Trifunovic also published an excellent History of the GEM Desktop Environment, which we also recommend. Later versions of DR FlexOS and its derivatives included a multitasking version of GEM called X/GEM [PDF].

DR worked around the limitations of the 80286, and found ways to put them to good use. Microsoft, for the most part, did not. Even Windows/286 couldn't use most of the memory of an 80286 PC, as we looked at last year.

As a result of the limitations of Microsoft's DOS, the 80286 was mainly just used as a faster 8086. This drove Intel to develop its following generation of CPU, the 80386. This supported multiple hardware-assisted DOS VMs with memory protection – and even if you just ran plain old single-tasking DOS, that memory protection let you rearrange that crucial first megabyte of RAM to free as much as possible of the 640 KB which was all DOS could directly use.

Without widespread use of multitasking, let alone GUIs, on late-1980s PCs, the original all-32-bit 80386DX was too expensive – even without its theoretical 4 GB memory capacity. So, once again, it was the limitations of MS-DOS that drove Intel to develop the cheaper 16-bit-bus 80386SX. This created a market for cheap 386SX PCs with cheap 16-bit RAM and a low ceiling of just 16 MB.

That market of cheap commodity 386 PCs is the soil in which Linux grew and flourished. Early 1990s 386 PCs were not workstation-class hardware. They were never expected to multitask, and they didn't run GUIs very well, but they ran DOS just great... and even their low specs allowed Linux to thrive.

Dispelling some myths about how DR lost the IBM deal

Yes, Gary Kildall was in his plane when IBM visited. No, he wasn't on a pleasure trip. He was flying to make a site visit with a very important business partner, Bill Godbout, for whom The Reg ran an obituary in 2018. Along on the trip was his colleague Tom Rolander, who has told this story repeatedly, including on video (from 17 minutes onward). Rolander has also told the story to industry commentator Robert Scoble (Scoble's interview can be found on the Wayback Machine).

Microsoft open-sources the 6502 BASIC coded by Bill Gates himself

50 years ago, Gates and Allen made the deal that launched Microsoft

FreeDOS 1.4: Still DOS, still FOSS, more modern than ever

How a good business deal made us underestimate BASIC

DR was based in Pacific Grove, some 80 miles or nearly a 90-minute drive from Silicon Valley. Kildall often chose to fly. If you had that option, wouldn't you?

Kildall wasn't at the meeting with IBM because it was not his job – he was a programmer. His wife and business partner, Dorothy McEwen Kildall, co-founded DR and she handled corporate negotiations.

IBM wanted a harsh NDA and a one-off payment. She refused, which was a sensible call; DR dominated business computing, and IBM wasn't even in that market.

In other words, IBM tried to drive a tough deal with the big player that dominated the sector. It didn't work, so it negotiated poorly with a bunch of upstart kids: it let Microsoft keep a licence to resell DOS to other vendors. Two poor deals in a row show that it wasn't IBM being canny; it was merely IBM being bureaucratic and institutional, poor at negotiation and compromise. It handed Microsoft the keys to the bank, and the tiny startup used them.

We've even seen a perception that what the industry got from Microsoft was better: more capable and more open.

In fact, it was DR, consigned to second place, that worked harder. It delivered a small, fast, clean GUI with GEM. Abort Retry Fail has a good Short History of CP/M-86, which shows how DR delivered and continued to deliver. It had a multitasking CP/M-86 by 1982.

By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps. In 1985, DR released the C rewrite, Concurrent DOS 286, two years before IBM and Microsoft's combined effort. By 1987, when OS/2 staggered out, DR was offering Concurrent DOS 386, with built-in networking as well.

The Reg FOSS desk used and supported Concurrent DOS 386 in his first job, and it was remarkable. On his employer's demo machines, he used CDOS to generate large Mandelbrot sets, which took many hours, using Fractint – but with Fractint running in the background, and CDOS 386 running a copy of COMMAND.COM from IBM PC DOS 3.3 in the foreground session, so it looked exactly like a standard DOS computer and could be used as normal.

Without a time machine, we can't tell what DR would have done if it had delivered CP/M-86 on time. Perhaps it worked so hard on GEM, Concurrent DOS, DR-DOS, FlexOS, and so on because it ended up the also-ran. It worked very hard to rectify its mistakes, and if the PC industry had defaulted to DR OSes rather than Microsoft ones, it might have advanced rather faster. DR could have offered a multitasking 32-bit GUI OS with networking, able to run DOS apps, nearly a decade before Windows 95.

But it didn't. Squeezed out of the mainstream desktop OS market, it focused on multiuser, real-time, and point-of-sale systems instead. In the end, Novell acquired DR in 1991.

All because CP/M-86 was late. Trifunovic explains why and how that happened. That's vital info: it shaped the future of the PC industry, and trillion-dollar businesses hinged upon it. As wise people have noted, it's important to know your history.

With the phasing out of Section 25D at the end of 2025, the US residential solar sector must once again adapt to dramatic shifts to the tax credit landscape, a phenomenon known as the ""solar-coaster.""

In this episode of the “Energy Evolution” podcast, host Dan Testa discussed the implications of these changes with S&P Global Energy renewable energy reporter Kirsten Errick. Cinthya Peña, a renewables market analyst at S&P Global Energy Horizons, and Maheep Mandloi, director of clean energy equity research at Mizuho Americas, also shed light on how this tax credit cliff could alter the market.

Copper in the Age of AI: Challenges of Electrification

This comprehensive S&P Global study identifies a transformative trajectory for copper demand. Global demand is projected to rise 50% to 42 million metric tons by 2040, from 28 million metric tons in 2025, underscoring the metal's pivotal role in multiple technological and economic domains. However, there are significant obstacles in meeting these needs. The study projects a potential shortfall of 10 million metric tons by 2040 without meaningful supply expansion.

Copper is essential for the generation, transmission and use of electricity. However, the demand for copper will outrun supply unless there is a major adjustment across the copper supply system.

Private Credit Outlook 2026

Private credit enters 2026 facing its most challenging environment since the 2008 financial crisis. Global economic uncertainty around trade, investor jitters over runaway spending on AI and damaging headlines tied to late-cycle excesses in broader credit markets mean fund managers and allocators must tread carefully.

Cracks are emerging in corporate credit. A series of high-profile leveraged loan defaults in late 2025 and the rising use of payment-in-kind toggles in direct lending point to mounting stress. A new cohort of distressed and opportunistic credit funds, which have raised more than $100 billion over the past two years, is poised to capitalize on any resulting volatility.

Private credit is changing rapidly. The market of 2030 will look materially different from that of 2020. After years of allocating predominantly to US direct lending, allocators are broadening their horizons by geography and sub-strategy. The surge in European fundraising in 2025 is unlikely to be short-lived as allocators increasingly turn to the region for diversification and alpha.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/Corp_0606_DailyUpdateSustainability?$responsive$,N,,2026-01-12 08:15:17.187118

Morgan Stanley's Downgrade Impact

This Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded Capgemini from market-weight to underweight and reduced its price target from EUR 145 to EUR 142, citing concerns about the company's organic growth trajectory, particularly after the acquisition of WNS in the fourth quarter of 2025. The American bank highlights that the organic growth expectations for 2026 have been reduced to 2.5% from 4.5% a year ago. Analysts believe there is no path to further expansion of valuation multiples. This recommendation comes as the stock was trading close to its major technical resistance at EUR 151.85 the day before, after having increased by nearly 3% over a week and more than 21% over three months. Morgan Stanley notes that Capgemini's decision to stop directly publishing organic growth in 2025 will make it more difficult to analyze trends of acceleration or sequential slowdown. The stock is now trading at EUR 144.90, below its 20-day moving average of EUR 145.57, but remains above the 50-day (EUR 138.18) and 200-day (EUR 134.82) moving averages. The RSI at 57 indicates a neutral situation, dismissing any oversold signal despite the day's correction.

Monday's Decline Erases Recent Gains

Monday's decline wipes out some of the gains recorded since the beginning of the year. The stock had risen 2.31% on January 9th, closing at EUR 150.85 and flirting with the resistance at EUR 151.85. The 3.94% drop brings the price close to its 20-day moving average, a first technical support to watch. The MACD, with a line at 2.29 slightly above its signal line at 2.26, displays a positive but thin histogram (0.03), suggesting a weakening of the bullish momentum. The upper Bollinger band, located at EUR 151.78, is no longer immediately reachable, while the lower band at EUR 139.36 provides a safety cushion of nearly 4% below the current prices. Fundamentally, investors remain on hold before the release of the annual 2025 results scheduled for February 13th, a crucial appointment after the revised growth targets announced in November. The group had then raised its growth forecast at constant exchange rates between 2% and 2.5%, driven by demand in cloud and artificial intelligence. J.P. Morgan maintains a neutral recommendation with a target at EUR 155, while Grupo Santander keeps an outperform rating. The share of capital traded this Monday stands at 0.06%, a very moderate level reflecting a selective investor reaction to Morgan Stanley's note.

Excelsior Rotterdam had little to contribute against the high tempo and attacking intentions of PSV. After ninety minutes there was a convincing victory on the scoreboard, good for the first three points of the year. It is the sixth time in the club's history and the second time under Peter Bosz that PSV has won sixteen of its first eighteen league games.

Five names on the scoreboard

Paul Wanner opened the scoring within ten minutes. It marked his first goal in the VriendenLoterij Eredivisie and his second of the season, following his goal in the cup game with GVVV. Dennis Man laid the ball ready for the German after a strong individual action, notching his sixth assist this season. Ricardo Pepi doubled the margin and wrote history again. The striker became the third American player to score in the Eredivisie in five games in a row, Earnest Stewart and Michael Bradley having gone before him. Guus Til cleverly played Pepi free and provided his fifth assist of the season, three of them in the league.

Yarek Gąsiorowski also asserted himself with his third goal of the season. Mauro Júnior found the defender's head perfectly and notched his eighth assist. The fourth goal came courtesy of Ryan Flamingo, who was back in the starting lineup in league play. The last time the central defender did so was in September, also against Excelsior. Ryan scored his second goal of the season off a Joey Veerman cross, which marked his ninth assist. The final chord was for Dennis Man. The Romanian crowned a strong game with his fourth goal of the season, his third in the Eredivisie, and was rightly named Star of the Match thanks to his goal and assist.

High and low point

For Nicolas Verkooijen the game was extra special. The young Belgian made his official debut in the VriendenLoterij Eredivisie, having previously made minutes in the cup game with GVVV.

In contrast, the low point of the evening was the injury to Ricardo Pepi. The striker had to leave the field within half an hour after breaking his forearm at his goal. Pepi has since undergone successful surgery and is expected to be sidelined for about two months.

The jump comes after French publication La Lettre reported that Eli Lilly was prepared to pay €15 billion to buy Abivax, nearly double its current market capitalisation.

The report said no formal offer has yet been submitted to Abivax’s board, but that Eli Lilly is still in the race and is awaiting guidance from the French Finance Ministry on whether a potential deal would be subject to foreign investment controls.

While attending the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Abivax’s chief executive Marc de Garidel told Bloomberg News that big pharma could no longer overlook the company’s lead drug candidate, obefazimod, which he said may become “one of the most-used products in the next decade.”

The experimental oral drug is being developed to treat ulcerative colitis.

“We are concentrating on developing this drug, bring it to the market. That’s all that matters. The rumours, speculations, we have no control over those,’ Garidel told BiotechTV in a separate interview.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Justine Telliez said Abivax has emerged as “one of the most attractive late-stage M&A targets”in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following positive phase III induction data in ulcerative colitis.

In an acquisition, valuation would typically move above standalone levels as buyers apply a broader “control” lens, embedding a control premium and assigning incremental value to factors excluded from the base case, including execution synergies, lifecycle management and pipeline optionality, Telliez wrote.

UCP’s launch comes less than 14 weeks after OpenAI and Stripe announced their Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) – and directly brings on board a retailer (Shopify) that OpenAI had promised to onboard to its systems.

Like ACP, Google’s new standard can be implemented via REST APIs or MCP (Model Context Protocol). It can also be implemented via the A2A protocol.

At the National Retail Federation on January 11, Pichai said: “The industry needs a protocol that works at global scale and takes into account the nuances of commerce journeys, and this is a critical building block for it.”

What is the UCP standard?

The protocol facilitates interactions between agents or AI platforms acting on behalf of users, businesses selling goods and services, credential providers such as Google Wallet, and payment service providers (PSPs) like PayPal and Stripe, via a range of modular capabilities and standards

At launch, UCP supports checkout, identity linking and order management capabilities, building on existing standards including OAuth 2.0 and PCI-DSS, and with support for inter-agent protocols MCP and Google’s own A2A built-in.

A roadmap shared by Google says future capabilities will cover product discovery, support for multi-item checkout, loyalty benefits, and post-order management.

A phased rollout will see UCP first support payments in markets including India, Indonesia and Latin America. ""We are adapting the protocol to support broader regional use cases and localized payment interoperability,"" said Google.

A new agentic battleground

Commerce is proving to be a new battleground for agentic standards, with UCP Google’s second standard in the sector after it launched the Agent Payments Protocol (APP) to support financial transactions made by agents in 2025.

While APP was designed for payments companies, UCP appears to be a direct competitor to OpenAI’s ACP, launched in September 2025 with the support of fintech Stripe.

The world's two largest payment companies, Visa and Mastercard are also looking to power agentic commerce, launching their Intelligent Commerce and AgentPay platforms in summer 2025 to manage agent-led payments on their networks.

Writing late last year, analysts at London firm TTL LLP noted of agentic commerce and AI shopping that “the commercial implications are enormous. If AI agents become the primary gateway to shopping: Consumers may bypass traditional e-commerce websites altogether. Search volumes on platforms like Google could fall dramatically… New revenue models are emerging.

Philanthropy is evolving. It is becoming more strategic, more impactful, and more deeply personal. At Barclays Private Bank, we recently brought together philanthropists, charity leaders, and advisers to launch The Modern Philanthropist, a report based on specialist research into the motivations and behaviours of high-net-worth (HNW) donors. The event, held in London, provided a unique opportunity to explore the evolving nature of giving and the possibilities it creates for those who want to make a difference.

Understanding the motivations behind giving

Kicking off the event, Isabelle Hayhoe, Senior Philanthropy Adviser at Barclays Private Bank, explained that despite the significant – and growing – contributions of HNW philanthropists in the UK, there is still little clarity around what truly drives their generosity. To address this gap, Barclays commissioned research to uncover the motivations and behaviours shaping this vital form of giving. The result is The Modern Philanthropist, a report offering insights into how donors think, what prompts them to act, and how their approach is changing.

Cath Dovey CBE, Philanthropy Partner at New Philanthropy Capital and co-founder of the Beacon Collaborative, started the presentation by sharing a compelling picture of growth. In 2024, UK HNW individuals (HNWIs) donated an estimated £11.3 billion, with the median annual donation more than doubling since 2019 – rising from £5,500 to £12,000 in 2025 . Giving has outpaced both inflation and key market indices , suggesting real-terms growth driven by changing priorities rather than simply rising wealth.

Together, Cath Dovey and Isabelle Hayhoe explored what these trends mean for donors and charities alike. Their message was clear: philanthropy is becoming more intentional, and charities have a growing opportunity to engage high-net-worth individuals as partners in change through deeper understanding of the points of alignment in their goals, mission and motivation.

What the research reveals: Shifts in modern philanthropy

The report uncovered several themes shaping modern philanthropy. Firstly, wealth thresholds and liquidity events remain powerful triggers for major giving. While reaching £1–2 million in investible wealth is often the point at which donors start to make significant gifts, more than half have given sizeable amounts before hitting that milestone, often prompted by inheritance, business sales, or property profits. These findings highlight that the decision to give is highly individual, shaped by both a sense of financial security and key life events that provide donors with the means and motivation to act on their philanthropic intentions.

Giving is becoming more strategic. Donors now support an average of four causes, up from three in 2019, and many are formalising their approach: around one in three has set up a charitable trust, included giving in estate plans, or engaged a philanthropy adviser, while one in four has established a donor-advised fund. Yet knowledge gaps persist - a third of donors feel unclear about how charities operate, and many are deterred by the complexity of giving structures.

Impact all-round matters too. Two-thirds of HNWIs want their investments to generate positive social or environmental change alongside financial returns - a clear signal that philanthropy and impact investing are increasingly intertwined.

From insight to action: Why advice matters

Following a deep dive into report headlines, a panel of sector leaders joined Isabelle Hayhoe for a lively and insightful Q&A session. Fozia Irfan OBE (BBC Children in Need), Rory Brooks CBE (philanthropist and Charity Commission board member), Liam Eaglestone (Steve Morgan Foundation), and Roland Pearce (Barclays Corporate Bank) shared their perspectives on the opportunities and challenges facing philanthropy today.

Philanthropy is deeply personal, yet for many donors, the process can feel daunting. Questions about where to give, how to measure impact, and how to align charitable goals with broader financial plans often create uncertainty. In these moments, trusted advice becomes invaluable.

As Rory Brooks CBE observed, “Donors often feel isolated. They believe others understand complex giving, but they don’t.” That sense of isolation is common – and it’s why open dialogue matters. Conversations with a philanthropic adviser can turn complexity into clarity. They help donors articulate intent, explore values, and design strategies that align giving with tax, estate planning, and investment objectives.

The research reinforces this point. Giving structures – such as charitable trusts, donor-advised funds, and impact investing – can help donors maximise the impact and effectiveness of their philanthropy when used appropriately. While 49% of donors give cash donations, many use two or more vehicles: 36% have a charitable trust, 26% a donor-advised fund, and 20% are part of a giving circle. These approaches aren’t right for everyone, and understanding remains low, but when used well, they can unlock greater impact for both donors and charities

The message is clear: philanthropy works best when it’s informed, intentional, and supported by expertise. Trusted advice doesn’t just simplify decisions – it amplifies the difference giving can make.

Beyond capital: The value of expertise

Philanthropy is not only about financial capital. It is about what donors bring beyond money - their knowledge, networks, and experience. Liam Eaglestone described how the Steve Morgan Foundation uses business expertise to help charities build resilience and capacity. “Charities need both funds and professional experience,” he explained. “Donors can offer so much more than money.”

Roland Pearce echoed this point, highlighting the importance of infrastructure – data, technology, and systems that enable charities to measure and communicate impact effectively. “Good data is essential for understanding and improving outcomes,” he said. Without it, charities can struggle to demonstrate the difference they make, which in turn affects donor confidence.

The takeaway? When donors share their skills thoughtfully alongside their financial resources, they can help charities become stronger, more sustainable, and better equipped to deliver lasting impact.

Philanthropy as a human endeavour

For Fozia Irfan OBE, philanthropy is ultimately about people. “Philanthropy is not an act of doing but a state of being. When people give, it is an act of love.” She spoke about the power of storytelling and the importance of seeing the individuals behind the causes. Today’s donors - particularly younger generations - are more vocal, sophisticated, and focused on impact than ever before.

As Isabelle Hayhoe reflected, “Good fundraising is about the donor saying they are excited – how can I help? It should be about alignment, not persuasion.” That sense of synergy, between donor intent and charitable purpose, is what creates meaningful, lasting change.

Looking forward: Collaboration and lasting impact

The event closed with a call for greater collaboration and innovation. Both donors and charities must remain alert to risks such as mission creep, where organisations adapt too far to donor priorities. The consensus was clear: partnership between donors, advisers, and charities has never been more important.

As Cath Dovey summed up, “Philanthropy is a learning journey. There are many approaches, and donors are becoming more confident and knowledgeable.”

Economic growth update

HM Treasury responds to House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee criticisms

On 17 December 2025, the House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee (Committee) published a letter from HM Treasury (HMT).

The letter responds to criticisms made by the Committee in October 2025 regarding the government's engagement with the Committee's second report on the FCA and PRA secondary objective of facilitating the UK economy's growth and international competitiveness, which we covered in our November 2025 update.

In its letter, HMT provides additional information on the key issues highlighted by the Committee.

Facilitating economic growth. The response sets out the details of the evidence-based approach used by HMT and the regulators to support economic growth and steps being taken by the government to build the evidence base. These include a ""frank and comprehensive"" assessment of the sector's past performance and the development of a bespoke methodology to produce financial services clusters to help focus future policy to ensure it supports the wider economy. The response also outlines what the government is doing to support SME financing and proposals to require regulators to take account of the government's remit letter when determining long-term strategies.

Growth metrics. The government does not intend to undertake a further review of the FCA and PRA growth metrics.

Performance metrics. The government believes the right balance has been struck in the new timelines for regulators to determine authorisation applications and will bring forward legislation to change the statutory deadlines when parliamentary time allows.

International comparisons. The government acknowledges that international comparison on the cost of regulation would be beneficial but highlights some of the difficulties in making such comparisons (including the absence of collected data on the costs of regulation across jurisdictions and the lack of accepted uniform metrics for measuring regulatory performance) and that there are other factors that influence UK competitiveness aside from regulatory costs including strengthening trade, investment and partnerships ""between nations with shared interests.""

The letter concludes by noting that HMT will give a further progress update in summer 2026.

FCA and PRA update to government on economic growth work

On 9 December 2025, the FCA and PRA published letters sent to the government providing an update on their respective work to support the government's UK economic growth objective.

The FCA provided an overview of its work during 2025 and highlights plans to support growth in 2026, including:

Unlocking capital investment and liquidity. The FCA intends to reform rules for venture capital and alternative investment fund managers and consult on the pension charge cap so consumers are not disincentivised from investments due to higher performance fees.

Accelerating digital innovation to enhance productivity. The FCA intends to oversee the launch of variable recurring payments to give people more control of regular payments and drive competition, finalise digital assets rules and progress UK-issued sterling stablecoins, and set the delivery plan for open finance, prioritising SME lending.

Reducing regulatory burden. The FCA intends to further overhaul mortgage rules to enable more people to get on the housing ladder and unlock housing wealth in later life and finalise reforms to the redress system including providing clarity on fair motor finance compensation.

Making it easier for firms to start up and grow. The FCA intends to propose removal of the seven-day research waiting period to reduce delays in IPO application and prepare to allow some early-stage firms to conduct regulated business before full authorisation upon the passing of legislation.

Improving exports and inward investment. The FCA intends to establish a presence in Singapore and deepen integration with the USA. Our December 2025 update discusses the initial announcement of the FCA to establish a presence in Singapore through a strategic partnership with the AI Monetary Authority of Singapore.

The FCA also intends to adapt its supervisory approach, with more tailoring to firms' size and type, and prioritise enforcement of the most egregious harms. It calls for the government to provide clearer articulation of its risk appetite to assist with the implementation of its innovation and growth plans.

FSB report on non-bank financial intermediation

On 16 December 2025, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its annual Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2025.

The report, which includes the annual FSB monitoring exercise, describes broad trends in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) across 29 jurisdictions that account for over 90% of global GDP.

The main findings include:

In 2024, the NBFI sector grew 9.4%, double the pace of the banking sector (4.7%), increasing its share of total global financial assets to 51% (US$256.8 trillion).

All NBFI subsectors grew in 2024. The sector 'other financial intermediaries' (money market funds, hedge funds, other investment funds, trust companies, and structured finance vehicles) was the fastest growing sub-sector, growing by 11% over the year, to US$169.4 trillion.

Pension fund and insurance corporation assets grew 7% and 6%, respectively.

The narrow measure of the NBFI sector, consisting of entities involved in credit intermediation activities that may pose bank-like financial stability risks, increased 12% to US$76.3 trillion.

Most vulnerability metrics for entities within the narrow measure of the NBFI remained broadly stable. Fixed income and mixed funds showed high degrees of liquidity transformation, while finance companies, broker-dealers, and structured finance vehicles displayed high levels of leverage.

ESMA publishes market report on crowdfunding in the EU 2025

On 22 December 2025, ESMA published its market report on crowdfunding within the EU, which provides an overview of the state of the EU crowdfunding market, based on data received from national competent authorities under the EU Crowdfunding Regulation.

By the end of 2024, across the EU, 181 crowdfunding service providers raised over EUR4 billion of crowdfunding, with 21 Member States hosting at least one active provider. Loan-based projects were most prevalent, making up over half (58%) of crowdfunding in 2024, followed by debt-based projects at 23% and equity-based amounting to 12%. Debt-based crowdfunding differs from loan-based crowdfunding in that it involves transferable securities.

Similar to the previous report, the majority of crowdfunding investors focused on the retail industry, with 88% being classified as retail investors during 2024.

The top five countries in terms of capital raised were France (EUR1.45 billion), the Netherlands (EUR 1 billion), Spain (EUR0.45 billion), Italy (EUR0.29 billion) and Lithuania (EUR0.28 billion). Among the top five countries, France was the only country to have predominantly debt-based crowdfunding, amounting to 50% of funding raised, with loan-based crowdfunding amounting to 23% of funding raised. In contrast, loan-based crowdfunding was the most common type in the Netherlands (81%), Spain (60%), Italy (50%) and Lithuania (96%).

FCA launches review of bespoke market risk rules for non-banks

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published an engagement paper on the possible introduction of bespoke market risk rules for non-bank trading firms.

The primary focus will be a review of the current requirements in sections 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 of the Prudential sourcebook for MiFID Investment Firms (MIFIDPRU) and the corresponding sections of the UK Capital Requirements Regulation (UK CRR).

Chapter 3 identifies a range of possible approaches to setting capital requirements for market risk. The FCA is seeking stakeholder engagement, to narrow the options for more detailed consideration. The possible approaches presented are:

Amend the existing standardised approach. Amend the current K-NPR calculation (a capital requirement based on net position risk) and incorporate requirements within the FCA Handbook, or allow firms to scale down K-NPR calculations via a simple discount factor.

A margin-based approach. Extend the current K-CMG approach (based on the third highest daily total margin over three months) to uncleared over-the-counter derivatives using historic margins or apply it to cash products using derived margins from futures contracts.

An internally modelled approach. Amend the current internal model approach to make it more proportionate and risk-sensitive or use other risk management techniques such as variance-covariance matrices, Monte Carlo simulations, or scenario analyses to set regulatory capital.

A net capital rule (NCR) approach. Adopt an NCR approach based on firms maintaining specified minimum levels of net liquid assets.

Repurposing K-TCD for exposure to price risk. Investment firms that deal in their own name may also have to calculate a separate capital requirement to protect against the default of a trading counterparty (K-TCD). This includes the firm having to calculate a transaction’s exposure value to capture the replacement cost of an asset or contract and, for a derivative, its potential future exposure. These basic concepts could be repurposed to capture risk currently addressed by K-NPR. Replacement cost and potential future exposure can reflect current market risk of a given position.

A weighted liquid exposure method. Develop a methodology where firms assess the time required to close an exposure without moving market prices, with capital charges applied to the overall weighted liquidity profile.

The FCA intends to conduct a roundtable in January 2026 prior to the deadline for responses on 10 February 2026. It aims to publish a consultation paper later in 2026 and a policy statement in 2027.

FCA policy statement on tackling non-financial misconduct in financial services

On 12 December 2025, the FCA published a policy statement, amending its guidance in the Code of Conduct (COCON) to explain in what circumstances non-financial misconduct (NFM) could amount to a breach of the conduct rules. The policy statement also amends the guidance in the Fit and Proper test for Employees and Senior Personnel sourcebook (FIT) to explain how NFM forms part of FIT.

The amendments are intended to make it easier for firms within the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, to consistently interpret and apply the rules and follows the introduction of a new rule in COCON in July 2025, which amends the scope of COCON as it applies to non-banks (see our July 2025 update). Updates to the guidance include:

New examples and flow diagrams within the Handbook are intended to help firms apply COCON consistently, in particular, the rules in COCON 1. A decision tree is included to help firms decide if NFM amounts to a rule breach.

The guidance has been revised, where possible, to further align with relevant provisions in employment and equality law. This includes an example suggested by a respondent to demonstrate that the purpose of the conduct is as important as its effect. This shows how an individual can breach COCON even if their hostile and intimidatory communication is intercepted before it reaches the intended subject.

Clarification that managers’ accountability is relative to their knowledge and authority. The amended guidance will make it clearer that the FCA would not expect a manager to be held responsible for failing to stop NFM if they could not reasonably have known about it, and the FCA would not consider it reasonable to hold them responsible if they did not have authority to act in the particular case.

Withdrawal and/or amendment of examples and factors that risked imposing disproportionate burdens. This includes deleting existing guidance that gave a misleading impression of individual SMF managers’ disclosure obligations and publishing new guidance at COCON 1.3.3G.

Clarification that firms are not expected to investigate trivial or implausible allegations or breach privacy law when assessing fitness and propriety.

The FCA emphasises that no guidance can cover every scenario and firms will always need to exercise their own judgement.

The changes are set out in the Non-Financial Misconduct (No 2) Instrument 2025 (FCA 2025/60) and, together with the rule change in COCON, will come into force on 1 September 2026.

Financial Services Regulatory Forum publishes ninth regulatory initiatives grid

On 11 December 2025, the Financial Services Regulatory Initiatives Forum (FSRIF) published its ninth regulatory initiatives grid (Grid). The members of the FSRIF are the Bank of England, the PRA, the FCA, the Payment Systems Regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, The Pensions Regulator, and the FRC. HM Treasury (HMT) is an observer member.

The ninth edition sets out 124 live initiatives, a 13% reduction compared with the eighth edition published in April 2025. The Annex to the Grid contains a list of initiatives that have been completed or stopped.

Initiatives added to the Grid since the previous edition are:

Multi-sector. The PRA is due to consult on its framework for the prudential treatment of firms' exposure to crypto assets in Q4 2026. Stakeholder engagement and key milestones are expected in H1 2027.

Investment management. The FCA will review data collection for asset managers and funds. Stakeholder engagement is expected between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

Banking, credit and lending. The FCA expects to publish the findings from the review of high-cost short-term credit price cap in Q3 2026. The FCA plans to consult on its retail banking disclosure rule review in 2026.

Banking, credit and lending. The FCA plans to consult on its review of the retail banking disclosure rule in 2026.

Payment services. HMT expects to publish its response to the September 2024 consultation on a streamlined approach to payment systems regulation in the next four months.

State of suptech report

On 11 December 2025, Cambridge SupTech Lab, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Cambridge Judge Business School, and Digital Transformation Solutions published the State of SupTech Report 2025 (Report).

The Report provides analysis and insights from 312 financial authorities across 172 countries and six continents and is a global benchmark on supervisory technology (suptech).

Key findings of the Report include:

Adoption. Global suptech adoption has accelerated with 197 agencies across 140 countries deploying suptech, more than three times the 2022 adoption figures. Financial authorities in advanced economies have greater deployment compared to their peers in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), highlighting a global capability gap shaped by strategy and governance, skills, infrastructure, and budget constraints.

Suptech value recognition. Recognition of the value of adopting supervisory technologies has increased, with 18% of agencies rating suptech applications as very effective, 33.5% rating applications as moderately effective and 34% as somewhat effective.

Modernisation and AI. Technology adoption shows steady modernisation with continued reliance on foundational tools. AI maturity remains low, with 26% of authorities within the initial exploration stages and only 7% report widespread deployment, with advanced economies significantly ahead (24% compared with less than 1% in EMDEs).

Barriers. The principal barriers have shifted from purely technical issues to operational and human factors. Poor data quality and talent shortages are constraining design, with deployment, costs, and limited internal IT capacity impacting implementation. For AI specifically, data protection and privacy concerns remain paramount, alongside staff skills gaps and technical integration challenges.

Enablers and barrier removal. Authorities with coherent strategies report smoother implementation, higher data quality, and broader deployment, demonstrating the critical link between integrated planning and success. Agencies are actively addressing barriers to adoption through external training, internal training, bilateral partnerships, and peer-learning forums. Development is being led by internal IT departments and business units, with targeted external support from vendors and consultants. Procurement remains formal and structured, dominated by RFPs and tenders, though innovation methods like tech sprints and regulatory sandboxes are emerging, particularly in advanced economies.

The Report closes by observing that while there has been a growth in implementation, to realise the full value of suptech requires ""… more than incremental tool deployment"". It concludes that what is needed is ""… institutional readiness, strategic clarity, and collective action"" including stronger co-ordination across jurisdictions.

FCA publishes new webpage on risk warnings for mainstream investments

On 11 December 2025, the FCA launched its new webpage on risk warnings for mainstream investments. The webpage sets out the expectations the FCA has of firms in promoting investment products and highlights common misconceptions about risk warnings.

The key expectations of the FCA are:

Financial promotions must meet the requirements under the Consumer Duty, in particular, they must be clear, fair and not misleading for the consumer.

Promotion of investment products must comply with key rules under COBS, including that such promotions are fair, clear and not misleading (COBS 4/2/1R(1)) and give a balanced impression of the benefits and risks of an investment product or service (COBS 4.5.2R(2) or COBS 4.5A.3R(2)(b)).

When designing communications, the firm should put themselves in the consumer’s shoes with focus being on what consumers would want or need to know. Where appropriate, this includes testing communications.

A list of consideration questions to be asked by firms when planning promotions are provided on the webpage.

Common misconceptions highlighted are:

FCA update on new cryptoasset regulatory regime

On 8 January 2025, the FCA launched a webpage to provide information on the new UK cryptoasset regulatory regime and how firms should prepare.

Key points to note include:

Commencement of regime and application gateway. The FCA confirmed that the new regime is expected to come into force on 25 October 2027. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 (Regulations) (currently awaiting parliamentary approval) enable the FCA to set a period ahead of the commencement of the regime for businesses to submit applications to the FCA, and this is expected to open in September 2026.

Authorisation. Cryptoasset businesses will need to be authorised by the FCA to do business in the UK and demonstrate that they meet the required standards. Firms that are already authorised by the FCA to undertake other regulated activities will need to have their existing permissions varied before the commencement of the new regime. The FCA's Authorisations team is holding a webinar on 29 January 2026 to introduce the new regime and outline its expectations when assessing authorisation applications. Registration for the webinar can be completed here.

Transitional provision for existing cryptoasset firms. The Regulations provide a transitional provision for existing cryptoasset firms that are unsuccessful in securing authorisation to run-off their UK business in an orderly way and exit the UK market.

FCA launches three consultations on core elements of cryptoasset regulatory regime

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published three consultation papers (CPs) on core elements of its regulatory regime for cryptoassets.

CP25/40 covers proposed rules and guidance for firms conducting regulated cryptoasset activities such as trading platforms, intermediaries (including cryptoasset lending and borrowing), staking, and decentralised finance.

CP25/41 covers proposed rules and guidance based on the designated activities regime (see above) for the offering to the public of qualifying cryptoassets that are or will be admitted to trading on a UK qualifying cryptoasset trading platform (CATP), the admission of qualifying cryptoassets to trading on CATPs, disclosure obligations relating to admissions to trading and the issuance of UK-issued qualifying stablecoins, and requirements to prevent, detect and disrupt market abuse in cryptoasset markets.

CP25/42 sets out the proposed prudential rules and guidance for in-scope cryptoasset firms. It builds on CP25/15, which we discussed in an earlier update.

A detailed review of the CPs is provided in our article here.

The CPs were published a day after the draft Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 (Regulations) were laid before parliament – see our article here for further detail. The Regulations must now be approved by both Houses of Parliament.

FCA publishes cryptoassets consumer research

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published the sixth edition of its cryptoassets consumer research note.

Key findings of the research include:

Awareness and holdings. Whilst the proportion of UK adults holding cryptoassets declined compared to last year, overall awareness of cryptoassets among the general public remains very high at 91%, with awareness of stablecoins among cryptoasset users continuing to climb, rising to 58% in 2025 from 53% in 2024. The typical value held by investors increased, with more people moving away from small holdings and instead making larger investments.

Centralised exchanges remain the most popular route to purchase. Centralised exchanges remain the most popular method to buy cryptoassets, increasing four percentage points to 73%.

Call for regulation. Among cryptoasset users, 25% would be more likely to invest if greater regulation was applied to cryptocurrencies in the UK.

An additional research note on the impact of cryptoasset regulation on consumer decision-making was published. The research note examines how the availability of information about the regulatory status of cryptoassets and the protections that regulation may provide impacts consumers’ decisions and beliefs.

Notable findings include:

Providing information on regulation and related information significantly impacted consumer decision-making, understanding of the coverage of protections, and trust. For example, informing consumers that cryptoassets are regulated increased demand for cryptoassets.

Participants had a poor understanding of the potential protections under cryptoasset regulation. Providing additional information on protections helped but its impact was limited.

Providing additional information about cryptoassets and the protections that regulation might provide supported consumer understanding of protections and trust in cryptoassets.

However, many participants continued to misunderstand that they lacked certain protections, with the absence of additional information about the coverage of protections, making participants less trusting of the FCA.

Payment services and systems

PSR launches consultation on card scheme and processing fees

On 19 December 2025, the PSR launched a consultation following the March 2025 market review of card scheme and processing fees. The consultation proposes to implement two directions out of the four proposals included within its April 2025 remedies consultation.

The proposals the PSR intends to implement as remedies are:

Information, transparency and complexity remedy (ITC Remedy). This will ensure that acquirers and merchants through their contractual relationship, receive better information to understand the fees they are charged.

Pricing governance remedy (Pricing Governance Remedy). This will ensure that there is evidence behind pricing decisions and is intended to remedy the current absence of evidence showing how pricing decisions are made.

The consultation requests feedback on the form of the directions (draft ITC Remedy direction and draft Pricing Governance Remedy direction).

The PSR will introduce a remedy relating to regulatory financial reporting and expects to consult on a draft direction for such remedy by 31 March 2026. The fourth remedy proposed by the PSR in its April 2025 remedies consultation on the publication of schemes' information to increase transparency will not be implemented.

The deadline for responses is 17:00 on 13 February 2026.

FCA statement on contactless payment limits for PSPs

On 19 December 2025, the FCA confirmed that from 19 March 2026, banks and payment service providers (PSPs) will have flexibility to set their own limit for contactless payments.

The FCA understands that most banks and PSPs are likely to maintain existing contactless limits for the near future. If they do make changes, the FCA expects firms to communicate these to consumers under the Consumer Duty.

From 19 March 2026, Article 11 of the Strong Customer Authentication RTS (SCA RTS) will read:

""Article 11 Contactless payments at point of sale

Subject to compliance with Article 2, payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication where the payer initiates a contactless electronic payment transaction identified by the payment service provider as posing a low level of risk.""

The formal legal instrument making the changes to the SCA RTS, can be viewed here. Changes will also be made to the FCA's Approach Paper, with confirmation of the rule change included in the Appendix to the FCA's Handbook Notice (No 136, December 2025).

FCA and PSR joint response to HM Treasury payments regulation recommendations

On 17 December 2025, the FCA and PSR published a joint letter sent to HM Treasury (HMT) providing an update on their progress in responding to HMT's payments regulation recommendations.

Key progress updates provided are:

There has been significant enhancement of FCA and PSR co-ordination to address congestion in the regulatory landscape. Collaborative efforts highlighted were the consolidation of PSR functions into the FCA, working jointly with the CMA on digital wallets, and the revision of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority to establish principles for better co-operation.

Substantial progress has been made in the development of open banking and open finance. Initiatives highlighted include the establishment by the FCA of a new department incorporating both FCA and PSR capabilities, industry-led initiatives advancing commercial models for variable recurring payments, with 31 parties funding a group to facilitate the go-live of VRP phase 1 for lower-risk use cases.

The FCA launch of the smart data accelerator focusing on SME lending and mortgages. The FCA intends to publish a roadmap in early 2026 to establish regulatory foundations during 2027.

Consumer protection remains a priority, with significant focus on fighting financial crime and fraud prevention. The PSR's APP fraud reimbursement requirements, which came into effect in October 2024, resulted in 88% of money lost to in-scope scams being returned to victims, with 83% of claims closed within five business days. The regulators are investing in real-time data sharing, intelligence capabilities, and stronger risk management controls to combat fraud and money laundering. Additional measures include updating Strong Customer Authentication requirements to enable more agile regulation, monitoring financial inclusion as services shift online, and implementing a new public-private partnership model to deliver next-generation retail payments infrastructure that supports innovation, competitiveness and security while advancing the government's growth mission.

FCA progress update on Open Banking

On 16 December 2026, the FCA provided an update on the progress of Open Banking.

The number of open banking payments has grown by 53% year on year, with over 16 million users benefiting from the service (compared to 11 million as at November 2024). A key driver for this increase is the rise of variable recurring payments (VRPs), which account for 16% of all open banking payments. VRPs allow consumers and businesses to set up flexible, automated payments tailored to individual needs, offering greater control compared to traditional direct debits.

As part of the update, the FCA and PSR published a joint report on the development and rollout of commercial VRP (cVRP). Through a new organisation, the UK Payments Initiative (UKPI), funded by 31 parties across the sector, the current application of VRP will be extended to 'phase 1' use cases, which include utility payments, financial services payments, and payments to local and central government.

UKPI was incorporated on 16 December 2025. It has agreed fifteen guiding principles, which are set out in the report.

The first live payments under the UKPI scheme are expected to take place in Q1 2026. In time, cVRP will support further use cases such as grocery shopping and online purchase.

HMT is expected to introduce secondary legislation in 2026 under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. The introduction of the secondary legislation will give the FCA powers to set Open Banking rules and the FCA plans to consult on new rules before the end of 2026 for what's referred to as ""long-term regulatory framework."" Lessons learned from phase 1 of the cVRP will feed into the FCA's rules.

Final report on Independent Review of the Payment and Electronic Money Institution Insolvency Regulations 2021

On 16 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) published the final report on the Independent Review of the Payment and Electronic Money Institution Insolvency Regulations 2021. The final report sets out the findings of the review into the efficacy of the Payment and Electronic Money Special Administration Regime (PESAR). The independent review was initiated by the government in December 2024 (see our January 2025 update).

The final report found that the PESAR is not yet delivering on its core objectives. The procedural complexity, high costs, and reliance on court processes have led to delays and diminished outcomes for customers particularly those who are vulnerable or hold low-value accounts.

The review identified key issues with the PESAR:

Objective structure. The PESAR statutory objectives lack a clear hierarchy, and further clarity is needed to prioritise business rescue and customer transfers.

Court and cost burden. The requirement for court entry and approval of distribution plans is often disproportionate. The review proposes several measures to reduce the cost burden of PESAR proceedings, including providing firms and IPs with an out-of-court entry route to enter the PESAR without in-court approval, to reduce costs and delays, particularly for smaller institutions, and limiting court involvement by reserving court processes for the more complex and/or disputed cases.

Customer fund return. The absence of any FSCS protection is a gap that could be addressed as the industry matures to improve consumer outcomes. The review recommends considering the introduction of FSCS-style protection to enable rapid payouts and provide a robust safety net for customers.

Scalability and contingency planning. The PESAR has not yet been tested on large providers, and more focus may be needed to secure orderly transfers to a new provider or continuity arrangements so merchants can continue taking payments while a replacement is found. The review recommends the development of contingency strategies for the insolvency of major providers.

Market and legal efficiency. Targeted legislative refinements, clearer comfort mechanisms to IPs, and improved creditors' committee functionality are needed to reduce friction and encourage practitioner engagement.

HMT will consider the findings and recommendations of the final report and provide a response in due course.

EU MoU on access by non-bank PSPs to central bank operated payment systems

On 18 December 2025, the EBA published a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the EBA, ECB, NCBs, and NSAs on the co-operation framework for information sharing in support of the access of non-bank payment service providers (PSPs) to central bank operated payment systems.

The MoU operationalises the framework for co-operation and exchange of information between NSAs and NCBs, its primary objectives are to:

establish co-operation between NSAs and NCBs in the EEA for the exchange of information to support NCBs in their assessment of the compliance of NB-PSPs with requirements for granting access to central bank-operated payment systems in the EU

establish procedures in a cross-border scenario for the NCB operating the payment system in the host member state to notify the NSA of the home member state about the NB-PSP's application and the NCB's decision regarding its participation

harmonise the processes and procedures across the EEA for the exchange of information between NSAs and NCBs, by specifying the types of information to be shared, the timing and means of exchange.

To facilitate communication and exchange of information, all NSAs and NCBs will designate single points of contact and notify them to the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB). A standardised notification form for the exchange of information is set out in Annex 1 to the MoU.

The MoU comes into effect on the day following the date on which it was signed by the representatives of each authority.

AI

FATF horizon scan on AI and deepfakes

On 22 December 2025, the FATF published a horizon scan of current and potential Artificial Intelligence (AI) related risks and trends relevant to AML/CTF/CPF compliance.

Recommendations for best practice for enhancement of deep fake detection include the adoption of technological and support tools capable of identifying inconsistencies in video and audio content, enhancing multi layered verification, training for compliance teams working closely with technological service providers, and integrating AI into CDD, transaction monitoring, and investigative workflows.

Key indicators to monitor to assist in the detection of deepfakes in financial activity include suspicious patterns such as co-ordinated activity, rapid transactions to newly opened accounts, and immediate fund withdrawals following deposits. FIUs also monitor for incoherence, such as mismatches between IP addresses and customer profiles or use of a same device by different counterparts and unusually high transaction volumes.

Part two widens the scan to consider other emerging AI risks and trends, providing an overview of potential future risks for AML compliance presented by generative AI, discriminative/predictive AI, and fully automated laundering pipelines operated by AI agents.

EBA's AI Act mapping exercise outcomes published

On 17 December 2025, the EBA published a letter sent to the European Commission detailing the outcome of its mapping exercise on the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act).

The exercise focused on mapping the requirements involving high-risk AI systems under the AI Act against relevant provisions in EU banking and payments sectoral frameworks. In particular, the mapping exercise aimed at identifying and assessing areas of interaction between the AI Act and the EU sectoral legislation.

The outcomes of the mapping exercise are:

The AI Act recognises overlaps between some requirements on high-risk AI systems and EU financial sector law, with targeted derogations and synergies envisaged for such requirements.

The AI Act does not envisage targeted derogations or synergies for other requirements on high-risk AI systems, including human oversight, data governance and cyber security, for which the EBA has found that the EU financial services law already includes a wide range of requirements. Notable examples of existing sufficient requirements includes the extensive coverage of cyber security and business continuity requirements within the EU Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA) framework as required in the AI Act. Additionally, the EBA noted that CRR/CRD requirements already provide a comprehensive and technology-neutral governance and risk management framework that can be leveraged upon when supervising the use of AI tools.

The EBA concludes that the provisions included in the Annex to the letter provide a comprehensive overview of how EU financial services law already address relevant AI Act requirements.

EFAMA launches new and improved AI assessment tool

On 11 December 2025, The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) launched version 2 of its AI System Assessment Tool. The template assists firms in their assessment of AI use cases in line with the EU AI Act.

Updates to the tool include:

The introduction of a 'DORA-lite' version to help document and assess third party provided AI systems.

The introduction of enhanced functionalities and expanded data fields, focused on a more advanced analysis of business risks, technology considerations and internal governance.

A full copy of updated AI System Assessment Tool can be requested here.

EFAMA has published tutorial videos (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) to complement the AI-system Assessment Tool.

Operational resilience

ESAs advise on whether statutory auditors should be subject to DORA

On 17 December 2025, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) published a joint report (dated 4 December 2025) (Report) to the European Commission advising on whether statutory auditors should be subject to the EU Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA).

The implications of bringing statutory auditors and audit firms within the scope of DORA identified in the Report are:

Market perspective. Inclusion of statutory auditors and audit firms in the scope of DORA could raise fixed costs and reinforce concentration, limiting audit choice and conflicting with competition and administrative burden reduction objectives.

Auditees’ perspective. Extending DORA requirements to auditors could increase audit fees, with the added value of higher resilience safeguards unlikely to outweigh the cost impact for the audited entities.

Supervisory perspective. National audit oversight authorities would require significant training to supervise DORA compliance.

Implementation & governance perspective. Extending DORA would require adjustments to ICT-incident reporting flows, TLPT authority designation and the Oversight Framework.

Co-operation between authorities. Extending DORA requirements to auditors would raise questions on how to include the auditors’ supervisory authority within the ESAs decision making process.

Inclusion of service providers in the scope of DORA. Unlike many other essential service providers, auditors would be regulated under DORA while similar non-regulated providers would not, raising consistency concerns.

The Report concludes that the identified implications of the application of DORA to the statutory auditors and audit firms outweighs the potential benefits, and therefore, statutory auditors and audit firms should not be included within the scope of DORA at this stage.

Financial crime

FCA fines Nationwide Building Society for financial crime failings

On 11 December 2025, the FCA published the final notice issued to Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide), imposing a fine totalling £44,078,500 for inadequate financial crime systems and controls.

Between October 2016 and July 2021, a number of deficiencies were identified in Nationwide's AML monitoring systems and controls. In particular:

Weaknesses in Nationwide's AML systems and controls had a material impact on its ability to effectively monitor customer relationships. The systems for refreshing customer due diligence and carrying out customer risk assessment were ineffective for all personal current account customers.

Aside from customers already assessed as high risk, and in breach of its own policies, Nationwide had no process for undertaking either periodic or event-driven reviews of a substantial proportion of its customer relationships.

Nationwide was aware that some customers were using personal accounts for business activity, in breach of its terms and conditions. However, it did not offer business current accounts for SMEs at that time so did not have the right processes in place to manage financial crime risks from business activity.

Receipt of Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (JRS) funds into a personal current account is a strong indicator of business use. In total 33,678 JRS payments totalling £64.6 million were paid into 5,191 personal accounts at Nationwide. In one case, Nationwide failed to identify, despite opportunities, a customer using personal current accounts to receive fraudulent JRS payments. The customer received 24 payments totalling £27.3 million over 13 months, with £26.01 million of this deposited over eight days. HMRC recovered £26.5 million but approximately £800,000 remains unrecovered.

Nationwide progressed or implemented a number of workstreams aimed at remediating or uplifting weaknesses in AML monitoring deficiencies, including through an ongoing project aimed at ensuring compliance with the MLRs 2017. However, these workstreams did not address the weaknesses in a sufficiently effective or timely manner.

The FCA found that Nationwide had breached Principle 3, and SYSC rules 6.1.1R and 6.3.1R.

The fine was subject to a 30% stage 1 discount from £62,969,297, pursuant to the FCA's executive settlement procedures.

HM Treasury Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Supervision Report 2024-25

On 8 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) published its annual report on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervision.

Key updates in the report include:

Supervisory consolidation. Following analysis of consultation evidence, the government has decided to make the FCA the AML/CTF supervisor for professional services firms. A further consultation on the proposed framework for FCA supervision closed on 24 December 2025 (see our December 2025 and November 2025 updates for further detail).

FATF assessment preparation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has begun its fifth round of assessments of global efforts to tackle money laundering, and terrorist and proliferation financing. As part of this, the UK will undergo an in-depth evaluation by its peers, culminating in a Mutual Evaluation Report, which will be published in 2028.

Notable supervisory statistics for the 2024/25 period include:

Registration activity. A total of 12,888 applications from businesses for AML/CTF supervision were received with 933 of those rejected.

Risk categorisation. Approximately 9% of the supervised population were categorised as high-risk. This is broadly in line with prior years of 2023-24 (9%) and 2022-23 (10%).

Direct supervision activity. There were a total of 7,991 direct supervision actions (desk-based reviews and onsite visits) conducted across all 25 supervisors. This represents 8% of supervised firms being subject to direct supervision action in 2024-25, compared to 10% in 2023-24.

Suspicious activity reports (SARs). 1,412 firms were asked to share SARs with their supervisor, with 798 of those being assessed by a supervisor for quality. Of those, 62 were assessed as inadequate.

Enforcement fines. The total sum of fines across all 25 supervisors was £59.5 million, compared to £41.5 million in 2023-24. Across all supervisors, £52.5 million of fines were issued to high-risk businesses, £5.5 million of fines were issued to medium-risk businesses, and £1.5 million of fines to low-risk businesses.

Formal and informal actions. Across all 25 supervisors, 976 formal actions and 731 informal actions were taken against high-risk businesses, 307 formal actions and 555 informal actions were taken against medium-risk businesses, and 235 formal actions and 619 informal actions were taken against low-risk businesses.

Published enforcement actions. In the 2024-25 reporting period, the 25 supervisors published a total of 1,100 of their enforcement actions online.

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.
The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

The move comes as part of the Stargate Project announced in January 2025.

This direct capital infusion is designed to accelerate the expansion of data centre and energy infrastructure to meet surging demand for advanced AI computing power—a sector increasingly seen as foundational to future economic growth.

The investment builds upon a much broader, previously pledged $500bn commitment made public at the White House earlier this year.

OpenAI has selected SB Energy to construct and manage its 1.2GW data centre in Milam County, Texas, which was previously announced.

The site will serve as a central component of OpenAI’s infrastructure expansion plans.

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.

Construction on these initial sites has commenced, with service dates expected from 2026 onwards.

The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

This model integrates OpenAI’s design specifications for first-party data centres with SB Energy’s experience in project execution and integrated energy supply to establish scalable infrastructure capable of supporting large-scale AI operations.

OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman said: “Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data centre infrastructure, and energy development and OpenAI’s deep domain expertise in data centre engineering.

“The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimised AI data centres.”

SB Energy’s Milam County project is forecasted to generate significant employment in the area during the construction phase.

The company states that it has designed the facility with measures intended to reduce water usage and plans to add new generating capacity dedicated to powering the site.

This approach seeks to address both operational needs and local grid stability.

To support its growing portfolio of data centres, SB Energy recently completed the acquisition of Studio 151, a company specialising in construction management, procurement, engineering, and operations across more than 20 previous data centre campuses.

The acquisition is intended to strengthen SB Energy’s ability to oversee complex projects internally as demand for data processing continues to rise.

SB Energy co-CEO Rich Hossfeld said: “SB Energy’s strategic partnership with OpenAI accelerates our delivery of advanced AI data centre campuses and associated energy infrastructure at the scale required to advance Stargate and secure America’s AI future.”

Earlier investment rounds have also contributed capital to support SB Energy’s growth trajectory.

In 2025, Ares Infrastructure Opportunities funds invested $800m in redeemable preferred equity, marking their third financing round with SB Energy since 2020.

As part of this expanded relationship, SB Energy will adopt OpenAI products internally by integrating APIs and deploying tools such as ChatGPT for employee use.",https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/OpenAI.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 06:00:44.141794

The latest KPMG and Recruitment & Employment Confederation UK report on jobs, compiled by S&P Global, showed the permanent placements index slipped to 44.3 points in December from 45.5 in November, signalling a sharper contraction.

Any reading below 50 points indicates a month-on-month decline.

Temporary billings also fell for a second consecutive month, though at a milder pace. The temporary billings index edged down to 47.6 points from 48.8, pointing to a modest reduction in demand for short-term staff.

KPMG said firms continued to exercise caution on recruitment after a prolonged period of elevated cost pressures and global economic uncertainty.

""The jobs market at the end of 2025 was still signalling caution,"" said Jon Holt, group chief executive and UK senior partner at KPMG. He added that many companies were pausing hiring and relying more on temporary staff, with restraint likely to persist into the new year until confidence improves.

The survey showed permanent placements have now declined for 39 consecutive months, with recruiters linking December's sharper fall to weak business confidence and concerns around costs.

All monitored English regions saw declines in permanent hiring except the Midlands, where placements rose slightly for the first time since May.

Demand for staff also softened further. The total vacancies index slipped to 43.4 points in December from 43.9 in November, indicating a slightly quicker fall in vacancies at the end of the year.

KPMG and REC noted official data from the Office for National Statistics, which showed vacancies were broadly stable in the three months to November at 729,000, though still 8.3% below pre-pandemic levels.

The total staff availability index stood at 66.3 points in December, only marginally lower than November's 66.5, marking one of the strongest upturns in labour supply since the pandemic.

The permanent salaries index rose to its highest level in seven months, indicating a faster increase in starting salaries, though still below the long-run average.

Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said December data can be difficult to interpret but noted some tentative signs of stabilisation in the second half of 2025.

""With placements falling at a slower pace than the 2025 average in December there is some hope that we are seeing a December dip, rather than a change in the trend,"" he said.

The survey data were collected between December 4 and 17, covering responses from around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Walmart and Wing said over the weekend that they would bring the latter’s on-demand drone delivery to an additional 150 Walmart stores beginning this year and running through 2027.","Amazon is no stranger to this kind of reverse-engineering, given its brick-and-mortar Fresh, Go, and Whole Foods stores. But a new report detailing that the company plans to build a 225,000 sq. ft. everything store—well, that’s just the natural evolution of things, isn’t it?

Two decades ago, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos acknowledged: “We are physical creatures and we like to move around in our environment.” And what better place to do that than a fully immersive suburban superstore?

Indonesia and Malaysia temporarily restrict Grok

Indonesia and Malaysia restricted access to the Grok over the weekend, making them the first countries to do so in response to the AI chatbot’s generation of sexual content.

The temporary block intends “to protect women, children, and the public from the risks of fake pornographic content generated using the artificial intelligence technology,"" said Meutya Hafid, Indonesia’s communication and digital affairs minister, in a statement.

Malaysia joined Indonesia in blocking the service, which is available through the social media service X as well as in a standalone app, until proper safeguards are implemented.

Elon Musk’s xAI was roundly denounced last week for allowing Grok users to generate undressed images of women and children.

On Friday, the company restricted image generation and alteration functions to paid subscribers.

The Southeast Asian nations weren’t the only countries to express concern about xAI’s practices. The Brits were unsparing about Grok’s missteps—U.K. tech secretary Liz Kendall called them “an insult and totally unacceptable”—and India wasn’t much kinder, ordering xAI to make changes and submit a report on them within 72 hours.

“Sorry for the inconvenience,” Grok posted on X about the national blocks. “xAI is actively working to address the issue. In the meantime, using a VPN might help bypass the restriction.” —AN

The Instagram breach that wasn’t (or was?)

A whole lot of Instagram users received a suspicious password reset email in recent days, suggesting that the Meta social media service was having cybersecurity issues.

Not true, the company said Saturday.

“We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,” it wrote in a statement. “There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure.”

Phew, right?

Not so fast, one U.S. cybersecurity company says.

Malwarebytes insists that, in fact, cybercriminals have successfully stolen private data for 17.5 million Instagram accounts—physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.—and made them “available for sale on the dark web.”

So what gives?

The word on the cyber street is that they’re both being truthful. Instagram may have indeed had a password reset email oopsie—but that has nothing to do with the very real data scrape (not breach!) in late 2024 that recently exposed users’ private information.

Keep your digital head on a swivel, folks. —AN

Walmart to add Wing to another 150 stores

Alphabet’s drone delivery service is spreading its wings a little wider.

Walmart and Wing said over the weekend that they would bring the latter’s on-demand drone delivery to an additional 150 Walmart stores beginning this year and running through 2027.

For the unfamiliar, Wing will bring many (but not all) items you’d find in a Walmart to your door in “as little as 30 minutes.”

Groceries or over-the-counter medicine, rain or shine—Wing will bring the goods. (Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these drones. OK, maybe a little snow will ground them after all.)

The companies currently operate their service in Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Seven months ago, they announced that they’d add drone delivery service in Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa.

More U.S. metros are reportedly on tap, including Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Louis. Once the expansion is complete, Wing says it will deliver Walmart goods from some 270 stores and “serve about 10% of the U.S. population.” —AN

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Health and wellness queries already account for a significant portion of ChatGPT usage. According to OpenAI, more than 230 million people globally ask health-related questions on the platform each week, based on de-identified conversation analysis. ChatGPT Health builds on this usage by enabling users to connect medical records and wellness applications to provide additional context for responses.

The feature allows users to securely link data from medical records and select wellness apps, including Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. With these connections, ChatGPT Health can assist users in interpreting test results, preparing for medical appointments, reviewing diet and fitness patterns, and understanding insurance options. OpenAI states that the service is intended to support everyday health understanding and is not designed for diagnosis or treatment.

ChatGPT Health operates as a separate space within ChatGPT, with additional privacy and security controls designed for sensitive health data. Health conversations, connected apps, and files are stored independently from other chats, with separate memory systems intended to keep health-related information compartmentalized. While ChatGPT may use limited contextual information from non-health conversations to improve relevance, OpenAI says health information does not flow back into standard chats.

OpenAI adds that conversations within ChatGPT Health are not used to train its foundation models. Users can view or delete health-related memories through the settings interface. If a health-related discussion begins outside the Health environment, users may be prompted to move the conversation into ChatGPT Health to access the additional protections.

The company says the feature was developed in collaboration with physicians across multiple regions. Over a two-year period, more than 260 physicians from 60 countries and a range of specialties reviewed AI-generated responses, providing feedback on more than 600,000 outputs across 30 areas of focus. This input informed how the system communicates health information, including when to recommend follow-up with healthcare professionals.

ChatGPT Health is being rolled out initially to a limited group of users for feedback and refinement. Users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are eligible to join a waitlist. OpenAI says it plans to expand access and make the feature broadly available on web and iOS in the coming weeks. Some medical record integrations and third-party apps are currently available only in the United States, and Apple Health integration requires iOS.",https://cioafrica.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/51f176-20250930-a-smartphone-displaying-the-logo-of-the-artificial-intelligence-openai-research-laboratory-2000.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:00:56.768006

Trelleborg AB does not ship phones, EVs or cloud subscriptions. Instead, it sits quietly inside the products and infrastructure that define modern industry: electric cars, offshore wind turbines, commercial aircraft, biopharma manufacturing, mining equipment and advanced logistics systems. Whenever something has to be sealed, insulated, damped, protected or made to last under brutal operating conditions, there is a good chance a Trelleborg solution is somewhere in the bill of materials.

This Swedish engineering group has spent decades turning advanced polymers and engineered materials into mission?critical components. Today, Trelleborg AB is effectively a global platform for sealing solutions, engineered systems and industrial protection – a position it has sharpened after divesting its conventional tyre business and aggressively doubling down on higher?margin, knowledge?intensive niches.

The strategic bet: in a world racing to electrify transport, build renewable energy capacity, automate factories and harden infrastructure, demand for reliable, high?performance sealing and polymer solutions will grow faster than the underlying industries. Trelleborg AB wants to own that layer – and monetize it with deep application know?how rather than simply selling commodity rubber parts.

Inside the Flagship: Trelleborg AB

Trelleborg AB today is organized around specialized business areas that translate polymer science into tailored, application?specific systems. The company’s core franchise is no longer tyres but advanced sealing solutions, engineered materials and protective systems that enable demanding customers to hit tougher regulations, safety standards and efficiency targets.

On the product level, Trelleborg AB’s flagship offering is not a single SKU but an ecosystem of high?performance solutions that cluster around three themes: sealing, damping and protection. Within that, several product families stand out as strategic flagships.

1. Trelleborg Sealing Solutions – from EV battery packs to biopharma lines

Trelleborg Sealing Solutions is arguably the crown jewel. It designs and manufactures precision seals, gaskets, O?rings, rotary seals and engineered polymer components that must survive extremes of pressure, temperature, friction and chemical exposure. These are the tiny parts that decide whether a hydraulic system leaks, a wind turbine gearbox lasts, or a drug production line avoids contamination.

Key features across this portfolio include:

Advanced material science: Proprietary elastomers, thermoplastics and composite materials tailored for conditions such as deep?sea pressure, aggressive chemicals, sterilization cycles or ultra?low friction environments.

Application?specific design: Seals and components are not sold as generic catalog items; they are co?designed with OEMs in sectors like aerospace, medical technology, food and beverage, and energy. The IP is as much in the application engineering as in the material recipe.

Digital design tools: Trelleborg offers online calculators, material selectors and design simulators to engineers, embedding itself early in the design cycle. This consultative model raises switching costs and helps the company shape specifications.

Where this becomes especially visible is in fast?growing segments such as electric vehicles and biopharma. In EVs, Trelleborg AB provides seals for battery housings, thermal management systems and drivetrains where reliability and fire safety are non?negotiable. In life sciences and biopharma, its high?purity, regulatory?compliant seals and tubing support sterile processing and clean?in?place systems.

2. Trelleborg Industrial Solutions – infrastructure, offshore and energy

Trelleborg’s industrial and marine solutions bring the same polymer sophistication to large?scale infrastructure and energy projects. Here, the product set ranges from marine fenders and docking systems to tunnel gaskets, offshore oil and gas solutions and vibration isolation systems for heavy equipment.

Typical flagship?grade offerings include:

Marine fender systems: Engineered rubber fenders and docking solutions that protect ports and vessels, optimized for energy absorption, durability and environmental performance.

Tunnel sealing and water management: Gaskets and waterproofing systems for metro, road and water tunnels, designed to last decades under varying pressure and chemical exposure.

Vibration and noise control: Anti?vibration mounts, bearings and isolation systems that protect buildings, machines and vehicles from wear and structural damage.

These products benefit directly from the global push for resilient infrastructure and renewable energy. Offshore wind jacket foundations, for instance, require complex sealing and protection solutions that can endure constant motion, saltwater and high mechanical loads. That is where Trelleborg’s materials lab and field experience converge.

3. New frontiers: electrification, sustainability and lightweighting

What makes Trelleborg AB particularly relevant right now is how deliberately it has pivoted its product roadmap toward electrification, sustainability and lightweighting – three mega?trends that cut across almost every heavy industry.

Across its portfolio, the company is investing in:

Low?friction, energy?efficient seals that cut power losses in hydraulic systems and drivetrains.

Lightweight composite and polymer components that replace metal in aerospace and automotive, improving range and fuel efficiency.

Environmentally improved materials, reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), increasing recyclability and achieving compliance with ever?stricter environmental regulation.

Solutions for e?mobility and renewable energy, where sealing and insulation performance determine safety, uptime and warranty risk.

Put simply, Trelleborg AB is transforming from an industrial supplier of rubber parts into a knowledge?heavy technology company built on materials science, application engineering and regulatory expertise. That combination has become its de?facto unique selling proposition – and it is what makes the business much harder to disrupt than its humble components suggest.

Market Rivals: Trelleborg Aktie vs. The Competition

In sealing, vibration control and advanced polymer components, Trelleborg faces a set of highly capable rivals. Unlike in consumer tech, the competition here is fragmented, specialized and heavily influenced by regional strengths and long?term customer relationships.

Three competitor ecosystems stand out: Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, Parker Hannifin’s Engineered Materials and SKF’s sealing and polymer solutions portfolio.

Freudenberg Sealing Technologies vs. Trelleborg Sealing Solutions

Compared directly to Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, Trelleborg Sealing Solutions competes for many of the same OEM and Tier?1 automotive, industrial and energy accounts. Freudenberg brings deep expertise in elastomer technology and a strong presence in automotive powertrain and industrial seals.

Strengths of Freudenberg Sealing Technologies:

Longstanding relationships with global automotive OEMs.

Strong presence in radial shaft seals and powertrain components.

Broad geographic manufacturing base.

Where Trelleborg AB pushes back:

Broader penetration outside classic internal combustion platforms, especially in electric vehicles, aerospace and life sciences.

Stronger emphasis on co?engineering and digital design tools for customers.

A more focused corporate profile after decoupling from the tyre business, making sealing a centerpiece rather than one unit among many.

In non?automotive markets – for example in biopharma processing or offshore wind – Trelleborg often looks less like a direct head?to?head rival and more like a specialist partner that brings specific materials and application expertise.

Parker Hannifin Engineered Materials vs. Trelleborg AB

Parker Hannifin, through its Engineered Materials Group and Parker Seals, is another heavyweight in high?performance sealing and polymer solutions. Its Parker Sealing & Shielding product family competes directly with Trelleborg Sealing Solutions in aerospace, defense, semiconductors and industrial automation.

Compared directly to Parker Seals and Engineered Materials, Trelleborg AB usually operates with a leaner, more focused industrial portfolio. Parker brings system?level breadth: it not only sells seals but also fluid connectors, motion systems and complete subsystems.

Parker’s advantages include:

Deep integration with hydraulic, pneumatic and motion control systems.

Ability to bundle components into larger subsystem contracts.

Strong footprint in North American industrial markets.

Trelleborg AB’s counterpositioning:

A more specialized focus on materials science and sealing, often giving it an edge in extreme environment applications.

Lower apparent complexity for customers who want best?in?class components rather than fully integrated systems.

Fewer internal conflicts when collaborating with third?party system integrators, since Trelleborg is not trying to own the entire system stack.

In practice, large OEMs and infrastructure developers often dual?source between Parker and Trelleborg, but Trelleborg can win on the basis of niche technical performance, lifecycle cost and customization.

SKF Sealing Solutions vs. Trelleborg AB

SKF is best known for bearings, but its SKF Sealing Solutions and engineered polymer offerings directly challenge Trelleborg AB in rotating equipment, industrial machinery and heavy vehicles.

Compared directly to SKF Sealing Solutions, Trelleborg AB diverges sharply in strategy:

SKF uses seals to complement its bearing systems, optimizing performance of the full mechanical assembly.

Trelleborg offers sealing solutions as a standalone, platform?level business that spans many more applications beyond rotating equipment.

In markets such as wind turbines or heavy industrial machinery, SKF might present a highly integrated bearings?plus?seals package, while Trelleborg positions its offer as vendor?neutral, focusing purely on maximizing sealing performance, uptime and maintenance intervals.

The net effect: where competitors often embed sealing inside broader mechanical or motion portfolios, Trelleborg AB is deliberately carving out a specialist identity as a high?end polymer technology partner across multiple industries.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Trelleborg AB’s real product is not any single gasket or fender, but a defensible combination of advanced materials, application expertise, global reach and niche dominance. Several competitive advantages stand out.

1. Deep specialization in demanding niches

While many industrial giants chase volume, Trelleborg AB systematically targets segments where failure is catastrophically expensive and reliability is priced at a premium: offshore energy, aerospace, medical and biopharma equipment, tunneling and high?end industrial automation.

In those spaces, the purchasing logic is not “who is cheapest” but “who understands my application, can co?design with my engineers and will still support this platform ten years from now.” Trelleborg’s long history in sealing and protection, combined with sector?specific teams, gives it an edge in these conversations.

2. Materials science as core IP

Many competitors can mold rubber or machine plastics. The differentiation for Trelleborg AB lies in the chemistry: proprietary elastomer and thermoplastic formulations, composite structures and surface treatments tuned to specific combinations of temperature, pressure, friction and chemical exposure.

This makes the performance of Trelleborg AB’s solutions difficult to replicate. Even if a rival matches the geometry of a seal, it may not be able to match lifetime performance, friction behavior or compatibility with specific process media. Over thousands of operating hours, that difference translates into fewer leaks, less downtime and longer maintenance intervals – a compelling value proposition for operators.

3. Embedded early in the design cycle

By offering design tools, simulation support and co?engineering capabilities, Trelleborg AB gets involved early in customer projects. Once the seal or polymer solution is “designed in,” switching suppliers becomes expensive, risky and time?consuming for the OEM.

This early engagement model is one of the most powerful competitive moats in the B2B components world. It also allows Trelleborg to shape specifications and nudge customers toward higher?value, higher?margin solutions that only a handful of vendors can deliver.

4. Sustainability aligned with customer pressure

Industrial buyers are under intense pressure to decarbonize and reduce environmental impact. Trelleborg AB’s move toward lighter, energy?efficient and more environmentally friendly materials is not simply brand polish; it is becoming a technical requirement to qualify for future projects.

By converting sustainability from a compliance checkbox into a product feature – better lifecycle performance, reduced energy use, fewer leaks and failures – Trelleborg can command premium pricing and win tenders where regulation and ESG metrics matter as much as upfront cost.

5. A cleaner, more focused corporate story

After exiting the traditional tyre business, Trelleborg AB has a tighter strategic narrative: a focused engineered?polymers company built around sealing, damping and protection. Internally, that frees up capital and management attention to invest in the technology and markets that matter most. Externally, it makes it easier for customers and investors to understand what the company is about – and why its margins should look more like a technology?driven industrial than a commodity manufacturer.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Trelleborg Aktie (ISIN SE0000114837) reflects this shift from broad industrial conglomerate to focused technology?enabled niche leader. As of the latest available market data checked via multiple financial sources (including major real?time quote platforms), Trelleborg AB trades on the Stockholm exchange with a valuation profile that increasingly prices in its higher?margin, specialist positioning.

At the time of the most recent quotes retrieved, the stock was trading around its current range with data consistent across at least two independent financial providers. Where intraday data was not available, pricing referred to the last closing level, clearly marked as such by those sources. That price embeds the market’s view on how successfully Trelleborg AB is transforming its portfolio and executing on growth in areas such as sealing solutions for electrification, offshore energy protection systems and life?science processing equipment.

The relationship between the product strategy and Trelleborg Aktie’s performance runs along three key axes:

Margin mix improvement: As the company exits lower?margin, more commoditized segments and invests in advanced sealing and engineered systems, its product mix tilts toward offerings where materials science and application knowledge justify higher gross margins. That supports a valuation closer to technology?driven industrial peers than to basic materials players.

Exposure to structural growth sectors: By aligning product development with long?term themes – such as electric mobility, renewable energy infrastructure, biopharma and high?spec industrial automation – Trelleborg AB is effectively decoupling part of its growth profile from the classic cyclicality of heavy industry. Investors buying Trelleborg Aktie are paying not just for GDP?linked volume but for structurally expanding end markets.

Resilience via niche dominance: Because its products are deeply embedded and often specified into critical systems, Trelleborg enjoys relatively sticky revenue and strong pricing power. Those dynamics tend to support more stable free cash flow across cycles – a feature that equity markets reward with higher multiples when the strategy is credible and execution consistent.

In analyst commentary and investor materials, Trelleborg AB consistently highlights its focus on “selected segments” where it can achieve leading positions globally. That approach is directly tied to the performance of Trelleborg Aktie: each incremental win in a specialized sealing or protection niche tends to be disproportionately accretive to profitability and perceived quality of earnings.

There is still execution risk. The transition away from traditional tyre and commodity products puts more pressure on R&D, on maintaining talent in materials science and on consistently winning high?specification projects against formidable competitors like Freudenberg, Parker Hannifin and SKF. But if Trelleborg AB continues to convert its polymer science and co?engineering capabilities into sticky, value?added product lines, the stock remains tightly coupled to a story of gradual multiple expansion and disciplined, niche?driven growth.

Crucially, investors are not just buying cyclical exposure to industrial capex. They are buying a high?tech, materials?driven infrastructure layer that quietly sits under electric cars, offshore wind farms, metro tunnels and sterile manufacturing plants. That is the real product Trelleborg AB is building – and the reason its stock has increasingly been viewed through a technology?adjacent, rather than purely commodity?industrial, lens.

In an era where the most important technologies often disappear into the hardware and infrastructure we take for granted, Trelleborg AB is a reminder that the future is not only coded in software. Sometimes it is molded, extruded and vulcanized into silent components that never draw attention – unless they fail. Trelleborg’s business, and the trajectory of Trelleborg Aktie, is built on ensuring they do not.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405018_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:01:12.173593

If Rubin and physical AI themes have you thinking beyond a single name, this could be a good moment to scan other that sit across the broader AI story.

So with Rubin in full swing, partnerships across autos, industrials and media, and NVIDIA trading at $184.86 with mixed recent returns but very large 5 year gains, are you looking at an overlooked entry point or a market that has already priced in years of AI growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 46.4% Undervalued

According to RobertoAllende, the narrative fair value for NVIDIA at US$345.07 sits well above the last close of US$184.86, setting up a wide valuation gap.

NVIDIA's latest quarterly earnings report, released this week, showcases a company that has successfully navigated one of the most challenging questions in modern tech investing: How do you justify a multi-trillion dollar valuation in an era of AI hype? The answer, it turns out, lies in execution. Record Performance Driven by Blackwell NVIDIA reported Q3 FY2026 revenue of $57.0 billion, marking a 62% increase year-over-year and a 22% sequential gain from the previous quarter. The company's Data Center segment, which now represents the overwhelming majority of revenue, reached $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago.

Want to see what is behind that valuation gap? The narrative leans on heavyweight revenue, thick margins and a future earnings multiple that assumes sustained high growth.

Result: Fair Value of US$345.07 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this hinges on hyperscalers keeping AI spending high, and on competitors and custom chips not eating into NVIDIA’s margins or customer concentration.

Another View: Our DCF Says Overvalued

RobertoAllende’s narrative points to a fair value of US$345.07 and calls NVIDIA undervalued, but our DCF model lands in a very different place. With a fair value estimate of US$162.43 versus the current US$184.86, it flags the shares as overvalued instead.

That gap suggests the market might already be baking in a lot of future AI success. The question for you is simple: do you lean toward the richer narrative assumptions or the more restrained cash flow math?

But here’s the real talk: is Uber just a daily life essential... or a sneaky stock you should’ve bought yesterday?

Because while you were doomscrolling, Uber’s share price has been on a roller coaster that looks like a meme stock – big rallies, brutal dips, and nonstop headlines around profitability, regulation, and AI-powered everything.

You already know the app. But do you actually know what’s happening with the stock behind it – Uber Technologies Aktie, ISIN US90353T1007?

Let’s break it down: hype, numbers, rivals, and whether Uber is a cop or drop for your portfolio.

The Hype is Real: Uber Technologies on TikTok and Beyond

Uber is more than a ride now – it’s a full-on content category. Creators are dropping:

“I drove Uber for a week – here’s how much I actually made.”

“I only ate Uber Eats for 7 days – my wallet cried.”

Hot takes on whether Uber is the next big tech stock or a burnout waiting to happen.

On TikTok and YouTube, Uber content is all over:

Drivers flexing payouts, or exposing how bad peak hours really are.

Riders ranting about surge prices and celebrating cheap off-peak rides.

Finance creators breaking down whether Uber stock is a long-term hold or a red flag.

The clout level? High. This isn’t some quiet boomer stock. It’s a name everyone recognizes, uses, and argues about. Which is exactly why it keeps trending every time the share price pops or drops.

The Business Side: Uber Technologies Aktie

Time for money talk. You know the brand. But what about the stock – Uber Technologies, ISIN US90353T1007?

Stock data status: Real-time quotes require live market access. As of the latest available public data from major finance portals, markets may be closed or prices may be delayed. That means you should always confirm the current price yourself before making a move.

Here’s how to check it in two taps:

Search for “Uber stock” or ticker UBER on Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or your broker app.

Look for the latest quote, the day’s move in %, and the 52-week range to see if you’re buying high or catching a dip.

Why are investors locked in on this name?

Massive scale: Rides, food, grocery, and freight – Uber is basically a logistics layer on your phone.

Profitability push: After years of burning cash, it’s been pivoting hard toward actually making money instead of just chasing growth.

Brand power: It’s a verb. That kind of mindshare is rare – and Wall Street knows it.

The real flex: Uber has shifted its story from “we’ll make money one day” to “we’re working on efficiency and margins now.” That switch is what usually turns a hype stock into a serious long-term play – if they deliver.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Uber a game-changer or overhyped? Let’s hit the three big pillars that actually matter.

1. The Product You Touch Every Week

Uber is no longer just “tap car, get car.” You’ve got:

Uber Rides: Classic car, UberX, Uber Comfort, shared rides where available.

Uber Eats: Food, snacks, grocery, convenience runs when you don’t want to move.

Memberships and passes: Sub-style features with fee cuts and perks for power users.

For you as a user, it’s a must-have app. When your train gets canceled or you’re starving at midnight, you’re not opening a spreadsheet – you’re opening Uber. That kind of dependence is exactly what makes investors look twice.

2. The Money Machine Under the Hood

Is Uber “worth the hype” financially? That depends on what you’re chasing.

If you want instant stability, Uber is still not a sleepy dividend stock. It’s a high-energy, high-sensitivity tech play.

If you’re okay with volatility, Uber is more like a long ride with surge pricing: big moves up, big moves down, and serious reward if you catch the timing.

The company has been leaning hard into profitability and efficiency, cutting losses in some regions and doubling down where it actually wins.

Real talk: this is not a “set it and forget it” utility stock. It’s a story stock that’s aging into something more mature – and that transition is where traders either make bank or panic sell.

3. The Risk Side Nobody Likes to Talk About

Uber is powerful, but not invincible. Big risks:

Regulation drama: Cities and countries keep fighting over how to classify drivers, what benefits they get, and how gig work should be regulated.

Driver supply: If drivers bounce to better-paying gigs, wait times and prices go up – and users complain fast.

Competition pressure: Other apps want the same riders, same restaurants, same drivers – and they’re not shy about discounts.

If regulators go hard, costs go up. If competition gets brutal, promos eat into profits. That tug-of-war is baked into the stock price – and it’s why you see those wild swings on big news days.

Uber Technologies vs. The Competition

Let’s talk rivalry. Ride-hailing and delivery is a clout war, and Uber is in the middle of it.

Uber vs. Lyft (Rides)

Brand: Uber is the global name. Lyft is more US-focused, more niche.

Scale: Uber wins. More cities, more drivers, more use cases.

App usage: In a lot of markets, people only have Uber installed. That’s brutal for rivals.

Clout winner on rides: Uber. Bigger, louder, more embedded in your life.

Uber Eats vs. DoorDash and Others (Food & Grocery)

DoorDash is huge in food delivery in the US, especially in the suburbs.

Uber Eats leans into urban zones, cross-sells users from rides, and adds grocery and convenience.

Both blast out promos, free deliveries, and subs to get you hooked.

Who wins? Depends on where you live, but in pure brand-layer terms, Uber has a secret weapon: one app for move me and feed me. That ecosystem play hits different.

The Real Battle: Super-App Status

Uber is quietly chasing “super-app” energy in the West – rides, food, packages, maybe more over time. While in some regions other platforms dominate, Uber is one of the few US-listed names trying to be your default logistics app.

In the clout war, Uber wins on:

Name recognition

Global reach

Everyday utility

The trade-off? With great clout comes great scrutiny – from regulators, drivers, and investors who now expect real profits, not just vibes.

Real Talk: Price, Performance, and Hype

You’re probably wondering: “Okay, but is it a no-brainer at the current price?”

Here’s how to think about it, without needing a finance degree:

Check the chart: Look at 1-year and 5-year performance of UBER on any finance app. If it’s near the top of its 52-week range, you may be paying up for good news already priced in.

Look for pullbacks: When the stock drops on market-wide selloffs but the business story hasn’t changed much, that’s when long-term believers usually get interested.

Match it to your risk level: If you freak out on every 5% dip, this might not be your comfort stock.

Uber is not some hidden gem no one’s heard of. It’s a giant, visible, over-analyzed name. That means less “secret upside” but more liquidity and attention. News hits fast. Price moves fast. You have to be ready for that.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is Uber Technologies a must-have or an overhyped relic from the first wave of app unicorns?

If you’re a user, Uber is basically a game-changer in daily life. It gives you time back, bails you out when transit fails, and lets you turn hunger into a notification. On pure lifestyle impact? Definitely worth the hype.

If you’re an investor, it’s more nuanced:

Uber has serious brand power and scale.

It is pushing toward better margins and profitability, which is a major unlock for long-term value.

But it comes with real risk: regulation, competition, and those attention-grabbing price swings.

Cop or drop?

Cop (for some): If you’re into big, recognizable tech names, can handle volatility, and think Uber will stay the default app for rides and food for years, it can be a long-term hold candidate.

Drop (or avoid): If you hate watching your portfolio swing or you want boring, predictable stocks, Uber is probably too extra for your taste.

Bottom line: Uber Technologies is still worth the hype as a business, but not a blind no-brainer at any price. Treat it like what it is – a powerful, world-changing platform that still lives in the high-risk, high-drama side of the market.

Obviously brands want the shine of legitimate Hollywood entertainment.
Zac Ryder, cofounder and co-chief creative officer of Modern Arts, says this feature is going to be a game-changer for brand entertainment.
LVMH’s entertainment division, 22 Montaigne, for example, is developing projects with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, as well as Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment.
Many believed brand entertainment was just a glorified long commercial.","We’ve had branded entertainment since Procter & Gamble invented soap operas back in the 1930s. But today, brands are forced to diversify the ways in which they gain and hold our attention. It’s no longer as viable or effective to depend on traditional paid media tools.

Innovative marketers are increasingly investing in content and experiences that attract and engage audiences rather than interrupt and annoy them. And the shift is driving results. Brands of all stripes talk about “brand entertainment,” but it’s the exceptions that truly create actual entertainment.

I’ve spent a lot of time this past year writing and talking on the Brand New World podcast about the variety of ways different brands are doing this right. From WhatsApp working with Modern Arts on a Netflix doc about the Mercedes F1 team, to Dick’s Sporting Goods formally establishing an internal entertainment studio that has already won Sports Emmys for We Could Be King in 2015 and The Turnaround in 2024, to the unprecedented deal struck between AB InBev and Netflix. The latter, signed in November, puts the global brewer’s major beer brands front and center in Netflix’s push into live sports, as well as giving it early access to placement and integration in Netflix shows and movies.

Obviously brands want the shine of legitimate Hollywood entertainment. But production costs and other financial pressures have made working with brands a much more attractive prospect for Hollywood too. So I wanted to check back in with the executives behind some of these projects to find out what they anticipate the biggest developments will be in 2026.

The most significant drivers of these developments stem from the evolving platforms, fueled by audience preferences and behavior, as well as the economic realities driving brands and Hollywood into each other’s arms more often and in more varied ways.

Marketers—and audiences, for that matter—are going to see some big changes coming to screens, both big and small. Read on for what to expect.

Shifting platforms

Meta announced on December 16 that it would begin testing its Instagram for TV app in the U.S. on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices. Zac Ryder, cofounder and co-chief creative officer of Modern Arts, says this feature is going to be a game-changer for brand entertainment. Brands as varied as UPS, Bud Light, and Sephora have been building audiences on Instagram Reels and Stories, while other brands are jumping into the micro-drama trend of serialized, bite-size soap operas in vertical video.

Ryder says this shift means brand content on the platform will continue to look even more like entertainment, getting longer and more ambitious to better align with TV viewing behavior. Ultimately, this will further blur the lines between entertainment and social.

Ryder says that as a result we’ll start to see more big swings featuring A-list storytellers and talent this year. “This will be especially true for brands who are already very invested in IG and have spent years building their followers. And of course, if brands are going to start dropping more ambitious work on IG, they’ll drop it on YouTube as well,” he says. “In order to compete for brand dollars, streamers will need to become even better partners to brands, all of which will create even more energy in this space and raise the bar even higher.”

A growing number of people are watching YouTube (and soon, Instagram Reels) on their TVs. Meanwhile, streamers like Netflix and Disney+ are increasingly utilizing brand partnerships to keep subscriber prices competitive. Many of my sources believe these changing dynamics of how we watch and engage with entertainment will drive where brands can find the best opportunities.

“I suspect we’ll see more next-generation partnerships like those we’ve been involved with this past year, especially as the Warner Bros. thing sorts itself out,” says Jae Goodman, cofounder and CEO of Superconnector Studios. “I bet Skydance/Paramount, Disney, Amazon, Comcast/NBCU will all come to market with brands as true partners in surprising, innovative, mutually beneficial, and I bet very effective ways.”

A new strategy

Goodman helped broker the Netflix-AB InBev deal and has also helped giants like Nike and LVMH set up their entertainment strategies. He says the long-standing trajectory of how brands and Hollywood do business has fundamentally changed.

Typically, it’s TV networks and streamers selling ad space to media agencies, then creative agencies filling the order. Film studios and distributors sell partnerships to brands, then licensing and promotional agencies get creative with the intellectual property.

“Brands are now entering the market with real entertainment strategies,” Goodman says. “And brands are leading the conversation with entertainment entities by asking, ‘What if we wanted to achieve XYZ and then figure out the structure and cost?’ We refer to it as idea flow before deal flow.”

This past year, the Martin Agency worked with Subway Takes creator Kareem Rahma on “UPS Business Trips.” Martin’s chief brand officer, Elizabeth Paul, believes branded entertainment is growing up and moving from bloated bandwagons with hundreds of brand sponsors (see: Wicked) to fewer projects with a more focused audience.

UPS is a major brand that could easily jump on the blockbuster movie bandwagon or make a Super Bowl ad. Instead, “UPS Business Trips” was a relatively small, Subway Takes-inspired series in which Rahma and UPS drivers visit small-business customers. According to the agency, it had more than 100 million views across platforms, and generated 1,000% return on ad spend.

“For those who truly believe in the space, brand entertainment will stop being treated as a campaign format and start being managed as a portfolio,” says Paul, who suggests that the best brands will start thinking like studios, not marketing departments.

We’ve seen this most recently with Dick’s Sporting Goods’s new in-house studio division, Cookie Jar & a Dream Studios. Dick’s CMO Emily Silver told me back in September that this move will see the brand be more aggressive in the number of films and pieces of content it releases, as well as help the brand build more of a name for itself in the entertainment industry to attract different writers and projects.

“It gives us the opportunity to put a little more structure and framework around what content we want to produce and where we want to lean in to help build for the long term,” she said at the time.

New economics

The most significant factor in the pace of brand entertainment’s evolution is the business imperative from both sides to make the economics work. North American box office revenue for 2025 was more than 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels. And in the first half of 2025, major streamers ordered 24% fewer first-run and renewed scripted titles than the same period in 2024.

As production costs have skyrocketed, and the ability to get entertainment projects off the ground more difficult, Hollywood’s typically cool condescension toward marketers has thawed to the point of giddy embrace. Cynically, even if Hollywood sees brands as logo-plastered ATMs, brands see an opportunity to exploit this need for cash to do cool things that are actual entertainment.

“Last year, economic pressure forced marketers to be really choiceful with their media plans, which forced intentionality,” says Paul. “As brands got more selective, the most successful collaborations meant fewer swings with clearer creative intent. The result wasn’t louder brand entertainment, but more considered work—projects that respected fandom, embraced specificity, and trusted audiences to meet brands halfway.”

Paul cites the Martin Agency’s work on Bud Light’s Armchair Quarterback last year, a Netflix partnership starring Peyton Manning that parodies the second season of the streamer’s show Quarterback. Armchair Quarterback attracted more than 100 million social impressions, thanks in no small part to tapping into the fandom of Quarterback by working with the show, its producers—Manning’s Omaha Productions—and Netflix.

However, she reiterates that this can’t be a simple “exchange of relevance for cash. This is about forging true strategic partnerships that delight fans and move markets.”

Talent magnet

The relationship between Hollywood and brands has evolved significantly over the past year. Brand partnerships and content are not embarrassing for studios or streamers anymore, in part because of the aforementioned economics, but also because the quality is higher and the value is clear.

WhatsApp’s film The Seat, for example, cost about as much as it would to make and buy ad time for a 60-second commercial. But it also was high enough quality to stand on its own on Netflix. This is a virtuous cycle: The better the quality, the higher caliber of talent is attracted to subsequent projects, which in turn should continue to boost the caliber of these projects.

Ryder says a growing number of A-list showrunners, writers, directors, and creators have been reaching out to learn more about the brand world in hopes of finding a project to work on together.

LVMH’s entertainment division, 22 Montaigne, for example, is developing projects with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, as well as Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment.

“When we started making these kinds of brand projects 10 years ago, everyone on the talent side was so suspicious,” Ryder says. Many believed brand entertainment was just a glorified long commercial. That has changed as more high-quality films have dropped. “It’s a bit like a Michelin chef trying a killer food truck and realizing that could be a new outlet for their cooking,” he says. “There are just a lot more delicious food trucks out there now.”",https://fastcompanyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Branded-entertainment-will-just--scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 03:59:36.882686

BMO Capital downgraded Adobe from Outperform to Market Perform, citing increased competition in the creative market, particularly impacting smaller businesses, students, and freelancers.
Similarly, Jefferies downgraded Adobe from Buy to Hold due to competitive pressures from AI-enhanced alternatives targeting casual users.
KeyBanc also downgraded Adobe to Underweight, setting a price target of $310, following the company’s recent earnings report.
Additionally, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $400 while maintaining an Outperform rating, acknowledging Adobe’s better-than-expected revenue performance.","Investing.com - Goldman Sachs has downgraded to a Sell rating from Buy, setting a price target of $290.00, which represents a potential 14% downside. This target stands in contrast to InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, which suggests Adobe may be undervalued at its current price of $333.95. The stock has experienced a 17.73% decline over the past year.

The rating change comes as Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges assumes coverage of the software company, applying a 15x P/E multiple to Adobe’s SNTM (Q5-Q8) earnings, representing approximately a 50% discount to peers with a median P/E multiple of 29x. Adobe currently trades at a P/E ratio of 19.96 with a notably low PEG ratio of 0.56, according to InvestingPro data, which tracks over 1,400 US equities with comprehensive Pro Research Reports.

Goldman Sachs notes that Adobe offers lower revenue growth of 10% NTM compared to peers at 11% and lower EPS growth of 10% NTM versus peers at 18%, justifying the bottom quartile PEG valuation. InvestingPro data confirms Adobe’s revenue growth at 10.53% for the last twelve months, while the company maintains impressive gross profit margins of 89.27%.

The investment bank’s analysis considers a broad comparison group of technology companies with over $100 billion in enterprise value that have similar business models and financial profiles to Adobe and can be valued on GAAP P/E.

Goldman Sachs specifically highlights concerns about potential scenarios where Adobe’s EPS growth could face further pressure if the company increases investments in AI initiatives, or if revenue growth falls below 10% due to reduced pricing leverage amid proliferation of AI tools and increased competitive pressure. Despite these concerns, analysts project Adobe’s EPS to reach $22.69 in fiscal year 2026, suggesting continued profitability.

In other recent news, Adobe has reported strong financial results, surpassing both consensus estimates and its own guidance. The company delivered a solid quarter, with Bernstein noting that Adobe’s performance exceeded expectations, leading to a minor adjustment of its stock price target to $506. Despite these positive results, several investment firms have expressed concerns about competitive pressures affecting Adobe. BMO Capital downgraded Adobe from Outperform to Market Perform, citing increased competition in the creative market, particularly impacting smaller businesses, students, and freelancers. Similarly, Jefferies downgraded Adobe from Buy to Hold due to competitive pressures from AI-enhanced alternatives targeting casual users. KeyBanc also downgraded Adobe to Underweight, setting a price target of $310, following the company’s recent earnings report. Additionally, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $400 while maintaining an Outperform rating, acknowledging Adobe’s better-than-expected revenue performance. These recent developments highlight the mixed sentiment among analysts regarding Adobe’s future prospects amidst growing market competition.

Functional fabrications For all the hype around fashion at the Olympics, brands are still prioritizing fit, fabric and functionality.","The Winter Olympics and Paralympics will take place from Feb. 6-22 in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. Compared to the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics are typically smaller, largely due to high infrastructure costs and climate restraints. Around 2,900 athletes will compete in 2026, compared to 10,500 athletes in 2024. But the merchandise and marketing opportunities for brands are still massive, considering the buzz around sports, the billions of viewers and the allure of a “Big Four” city like Milan. In fact, partnerships tend to lead to sales; Anta reported a rise in revenue when sponsoring the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. This year, NBC said ad slots for the Winter Olympics sold out with “unprecedented demand,” luring more than 100 new advertisers.

“The Olympics are, hands down, one of the most powerful sports platforms in the world,” Harry Poole, svp at the marketing agency Excel Sports Management, told Modern Retail. Poole started his career representing Olympic athletes before shifting to the marketing side. “When you think about global connectivity and cultural relevance, [the Olympics] is a movement that inspires generations,” Poole said. “And the market for it this year is fantastic, when you think about Milan and fashion and what that means to the world.”

Milan is known for its luxury houses like Prada, its ready-to-wear styles and its quality craftsmanship, especially around leather goods. The city is also home to Milan Fashion Week, as well as the fashion district Quadrilatero della Moda. Aesthetics and design, then, play a major role in this year’s Olympics and Paralympics. For instance, this year’s official victory ceremony uniforms stemmed from a contest among three fashion design schools. The new torch design sports a sleek, minimalist look and a larger flame. Even the official motto of the Games is “IT’s your vibe.”

Fashion players, for their part, have spent months hyping up their Olympics products and partnerships. Per a December press release, Ralph Lauren’s Opening Ceremony uniform for Team U.S.A. includes a “statement winter-white wool coat,” while its Closing Ceremony uniform “draws inspiration from vintage ski racing kits.” “We look forward to … bringing our heritage of sport and style to life at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics,” Patrice Louvet, president of Ralph Lauren, said on an earnings call in November. The company’s nine-part TikTok series around the collection and its athletes has garnered more than a quarter of a million views.

Meanwhile, Lululemon’s uniforms for Canada feature topographic map prints and maple leaf designs. The brand recently posted an Instagram video captioned, “We’re not just from Canada, we’re cut from the cold.” “All of us at Lululemon are incredibly proud to support Team Canada on the world’s largest sporting stage with product designed for athletes, and with athletes,” CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.

Functional fabrications

For all the hype around fashion at the Olympics, brands are still prioritizing fit, fabric and functionality. After all, wearing an eye-catching uniform at the Olympics and Paralympics is one thing. It’s another to ensure the products are optimized for performance.

Nike, which sponsors the podium for Team U.S.A., will debut its Therma-FIT Air Milano jacket at the Winter Olympics. It has called the jacket “the brand’s most technically engineered garment of its kind.” The jacket allows athletes to regulate their temperature by inflating or deflating air within compartments. “Every detail was engineered to let athletes tune their own comfort and fit,” Amie Achtymichuk, lead apparel development innovator, said in a statement.

Apparel brands are creating distinct technology for non-athletes, too, as the healthcare apparel brand Figs demonstrates. 2026 is the first Winter Olympics that Figs, known for its scrubs, will outfit members of the U.S. medical team, or the medical professionals assisting the athletes. “Our goal is really to give them a podium of their own,” Figs CEO and co-founder Trina Spear told Modern Retail.

Figs first outfitted the U.S. medical team in 2024 at the Summer Olympics in Paris. It will do so again in 2028 at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. But Figs had to make changes this year when it came to developing scrubs, jackets and other gear. It ended up developing a new fabrication, known as FIBREx, that’s optimized for alpine conditions like colder temperatures and wind.

“We’re really leveling up from what we did in Paris,” Spear said. “In Paris, we were mainly inside, in sporting facilities, … [but] for winter, we’re on a ski mountain. We designed and developed really warm and technical products that are also really comfortable. … You need a product that’s going to support you in a 12-hour shift or [allow you to] support an athlete across many hours.”

Meanwhile, Dagsmejan, a sleepwear company, is giving members of the Swiss National Ice Hockey Team pajamas and sleep masks to wear at night. For athletes, proper recovery, especially during sleep, is “as much a part of training as nutrition,” said Dagsmejan CEO Catarina Dahlin. Dahlin developed Dagsmejan with her husband, in consultation with partners like the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. The company says its sleepwear uses breathable, natural fibers and focuses on temperature regulation.

As Dahlin sees it, Dagsmejan’s fabrications are perfect for helping ice hockey players wind down after a stressful day. “The matches often take place quite late, [under] very bright light and [with] high energy,” Dahlin told Modern Retail. “After that, you have to try to unwind and go to bed. But you’re also in a bed you’re not used to, and you may not be able to control the air conditioning. How well you recover really impacts how well you can perform and react when it matters.” Dagsmejan has supported the Swiss National Ice Hockey Team since 2021, and both have posted about the partnership on social media.

A lifestyle play

Not all fashion companies involved with the Olympics are developing technical fabrics for those on the ground in Italy. Companies can activate around the events in multiple ways, including through licensing agreements for gear like hats and sweatshirts. These items allow fans of teams and events to show their spirit — and they help boost sales for brands, too.

Some fashion brands are focusing more on the consumer angle. Chubbies, which makes swim trunks and board shorts, rolled out a lifestyle collection for fans to wear at home. The line — which includes performance polos, hoodies and lined swim trunks — is part of a licensing agreement with Team U.S.A.

Team U.S.A. gave Chubbies design guidelines, but the brand could still present its point of view, Tyde Kaneshiro, senior product manager of special projects at Chubbies, told Modern Retail. Chubbies ended up developing a print modeled after intricate snowflake photography. “In a lot of our seasonal development, we look to the runway for trend and color inspiration,” said Kevin Dopp, Chubbies’s senior design director. “But, in this particular [case], we looked at art as inspiration.”

The final designs have red, white and blue to reflect the colors of Team U.S.A. “It doesn’t look generic and feels very us,” Kaneshiro said. The brand is pairing the pieces with a humorous marketing campaign. An Instagram video shows a model in a studio, pretending to ski, while getting “fake snow thrown at him” from a fan, said Ashley Spencer, director of marketing at Chubbies. “We’re championing the vibe of the Olympics in a Chubbies-spun way,” she added.

Also in January, J.Crew rolled out a lifestyle collection with U.S. Ski & Snowboard as part of a partnership that will last three years. The pieces include knitwear, shirts and accessories for women, men and kids. “Our inaugural collection underscores J.Crew’s ability to connect timeless American style with the cultural significance of sport on a global stage,” chairman Kevin Ulrich said in a statement. J.Crew’s marketing campaign around the collection features pro athletes throwing snowballs and relaxing on chaise lounges.

Meanwhile, Skims released the fourth iteration of its official Team U.S.A. capsule, complete with loungewear, sleepwear and intimates. Per Skims, the collection has “rest and recovery in mind” and features “graphics that take their cues from team uniforms.” “It’s comfortable, functional and captures the pride I feel in representing Team U.S.A.,” Olympian Madison Chock said in a statement.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/J-Crew-Ski.png,N,,2026-01-12 01:59:45.549934

On Friday, Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced a bill aimed at curbing government employees involvement in politically-related event contracts.","Prediction markets let people wager on anything from a basketball game to the outcome of a presidential election — and recently, the downfall of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The latter is drawing renewed scrutiny into this murky world of speculative, 24/7 transactions. Last week, an anonymous trader pocketed more than $400,000 after betting that Maduro would soon be out of office.

The bulk of the trader’s bids on the platform Polymarket were made mere hours before President Donald Trump announced the surprise nighttime raid that led to Maduro’s capture, fueling online suspicions of potential insider trading because of the timing of the wagers and the trader’s narrow activity on the platform. Others argued that the risk of getting caught was too big, and that previous speculation about Maduro’s future could have led to such transactions.

Polymarket did not respond to requests for comment.

The commercial use of prediction markets has skyrocketed in recent years, opening the door for people to wage their money on the likelihood of a growing list of future events. But despite some eye-catching windfalls, traders still lose money everyday. And in terms of government oversight in the U.S., the trades are categorized differently than traditional forms of gambling — raising questions about transparency and risk.

Here's what we know:

How prediction markets work

The scope of topics involved in prediction markets can range immensely — from escalation in geopolitical conflicts, to pop culture moments and even the fate of conspiracy theories. Recently, there’s been a surge of wages on elections and sports games. But some users have also bet millions on things like a rumored — and ultimately unrealized — “secret finale” for the Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” whether the U.S. government will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life and how much billionaire Elon Musk might post on social media this month.

In industry-speak, what someone buys or sells in a prediction market is called an “event contract.” They're typically advertised as “yes” or “no” wagers. And the price of one fluctuates between $0 and $1, reflecting what traders are collectively willing to pay based on a 0% to 100% chance of whether they think an event will occur.

The more likely traders think an event will occur, the more expensive that contract will become. And as those odds change over time, users can cash out early to make incremental profits, or try to avoid higher losses on what they’ve already invested.

Proponents of prediction markets argue putting money on the line leads to better forecasts. Experts like Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University, think there’s value in monitoring these platforms for potential news — pointing to prediction markets’ past success with some election outcomes, including the 2024 presidential race.

Still, it's never a “crystal ball,” he noted, and prediction markets can be wrong, too.

Who is behind all of the trading is also pretty murky. While the companies running the platforms collect personal information of their users in order to verify identities and payments, most people can trade under anonymous pseudonyms online — making it difficult for the public to know who is profiting off many event contracts. In theory, people investing their money may be closely following certain events, but others could just be randomly guessing.

Critics stress that the ease and speed of joining these 24/7 wagers leads to financial losses everyday, particularly harming users who may already struggle with gambling. The space also broadens possibilities for potential insider trading.

The major players

Polymarket is one of the largest prediction markets in the world, where its users can fund event contracts through cryptocurrency, debit or credit cards and bank transfers.

Restrictions vary by country, but in the U.S., the reach of these markets has expanded rapidly over recent years, coinciding with shifting policies out of Washington. Former President Joe Biden was aggressive in cracking down on prediction markets and following a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket was barred from operating in the country.

That changed under Trump late last year, when Polymarket announced it would be returning to the U.S. after receiving clearance from the commission. American-based users can now join a platform “waitlist.”

Meanwhile, Polymarket’s top competitor, Kalshi, has been a federally-regulated exchange since 2020. The platform offers similar ways to buy and sell event contracts as Polymarket — and it currently allows event contracts on elections and sports nationwide. Kalshi won court approval just weeks before the 2024 election to let Americans put money on upcoming political races and began to host sports trading about a year ago.

The space is now crowded with other big names. Sports betting giants DraftKings and FanDuel both launched prediction platforms last month. Online broker Robinhood is widening its own offerings. Trump’s social media site Truth Social has also promised to offer an in-platform prediction market through a partnership with Crypto.com — and one of the president’s sons, Donald Trump Jr., holds advisory roles at both Polymarket and Kalshi.

“The train has left the station on these event contracts, they’re not going away,” said Melinda Roth, a visiting associate professor at Washington and Lee University’s School of Law.

Loose regulation

Because they’re positioned as selling event contracts, prediction markets are regulated by the CFTC. That means they can avoid state-level restrictions or bans in place for traditional gambling and sports betting today.

“It’s a huge loophole,” said Karl Lockhart, an assistant professor of law at DePaul University who has studied this space. “You just have to comply with one set of regulations, rather than (rules from) each state around the country.”

Sports betting is taking center stage. There are a handful of big states — like California and Texas, for example — where sports betting is still illegal, but people can now wager on games, athlete trades and more through event contracts.

A growing number of states and tribes are suing to stop this. And lawyers expect litigation to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, as added regulations from the Trump administration seem unlikely.

Federal law bars event contracts related to gaming as well as war, terrorism and assassinations, Roth said, which could put some prediction market trades on shaky ground, at least in the U.S. But users might still find ways to buy certain contracts while traveling abroad or connecting to different VPNs.

Whether the CFTC will take any of that on has yet to be seen. But the agency, which did not respond to request for comment, has already taken steps away from enforcement.

Despite overseeing trillions of dollars for the overall U.S. derivatives market, the CFTC is also much smaller than the Securities and Exchange Commission. And at the same time event contracts are growing rapidly on prediction market platforms, there have been additional cuts to the CFTC's workforce and a wave of leadership departures under Trump's second term. Only one of five commissioner slots operating the agency is currently filled.

Still, other lawmakers calling for a stronger crack down on potential insider trading in prediction markets — particularly following suspicion around last week’s Maduro trade on Polymarket. On Friday, Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced a bill aimed at curbing government employees involvement in politically-related event contracts.

The bill has already gotten support from Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour — who on LinkedIn maintained that insider trading has always been banned on his company's platform but that more needs to be done to crack down on unregulated prediction markets.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/853e1c3a-51b0-4ebc-8d31-fa95c3a84824/20260111T141504/853e1c3a-51b0-4ebc-8d31-fa95c3a84824.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 02:58:24.764158

Stolt-Nielsen is a Norwegian business executive serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors at Stolt-Nielsen Limited, a global transportation and logistics company specializing in chemicals, gases, and aquaculture, since September 2023.[1] He previously held the position of Chief Executive Officer at the company from 2000 to 2023, overseeing its expansion and strategic initiatives in maritime and related sectors.[1] A graduate of Hofstra University with a BS in Business and Finance from 1990, Stolt-Nielsen joined the Stolt-Nielsen organization in 1990, initially working in Greenwich, Connecticut, before relocating to Shanghai in 1994 to establish the company's representative office there.[1] Stolt-Nielsen's career trajectory within the family-founded enterprise includes pivotal roles such as President of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000 and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Stolt Offshore S.A. from September 2002 to March 2003, during which he navigated key operational and market challenges in the offshore energy sector.[1] Beyond Stolt-Nielsen Limited, where he has been a Director since 1996, he currently chairs the Board of Avenir LNG Limited, a joint venture focused on small-scale LNG distribution, and serves as a Director at Golar LNG Limited, a leading provider of LNG infrastructure and shipping solutions.[1][2] His leadership has been instrumental in fostering long-term value creation, including growth into sustainable energy and aquaculture ventures.[3] As a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees at Stolt-Nielsen Limited, he continues to influence governance and strategic oversight in the maritime industry.[1]

Early life and education

Family background

Niels Gregers Stolt-Nielsen was born on January 23, 1965, in Norway. He is the son of Jacob Stolt-Nielsen (1931–2015), who founded Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1959 as a pioneering venture in specialized shipping.[4] The Stolt-Nielsen family traces its heritage to third-generation shipownership in Norway, with roots in Haugesund where Jacob grew up immersed in maritime activities, including running the family herring business as a teenager.[4] The family has played a pivotal role in global shipping, particularly through innovations in parcel tankers designed for safe transport of bulk liquids such as chemicals and edible oils, establishing industry standards without venturing into general cargo operations.[4] Raised in this influential shipping dynasty, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen experienced early exposure to the family business environment, shaped by Norway's coastal heritage and the harbor views that inspired generations of Stolt-Nielsens. The family continues to hold a controlling interest in Stolt-Nielsen Limited, underscoring their enduring legacy in the sector.[4]

Academic pursuits

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen pursued his higher education in the United States, enrolling at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. He graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Business and Finance.[1][5] His choice to study in the United States, far from his native Norway, reflected the international orientation of his family's shipping legacy, providing exposure to a dynamic business environment centered in New York.[4]

Career at Stolt-Nielsen Limited

Initial roles and international expansion

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen joined Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1990, immediately after graduating from Hofstra University with a BS in Business and Finance, beginning his career as a shipbroker at the company's office in Greenwich, Connecticut.[1] In this initial role, he focused on chartering and brokerage activities within the bulk liquid transportation sector, leveraging his finance background to support Stolt Tankers' operations in the U.S. market.[1] By the early 1990s, Stolt-Nielsen advanced to the position of round-voyage manager, where he oversaw the planning and execution of shipping routes for chemical and product tankers, contributing to operational efficiency amid growing global trade demands. This progression highlighted his early aptitude for logistics coordination, setting the stage for broader international responsibilities.[6] In 1994, Stolt-Nielsen played a pivotal role in the company's international expansion by relocating to China to establish and lead Stolt-Nielsen Limited's first representative office in Shanghai.[1] This initiative marked a strategic entry into the Asian market, facilitating local partnerships and market intelligence for Stolt Tankers' growing presence in the region, which was undergoing rapid economic liberalization.[7] His efforts in organizing the office underscored the company's commitment to global outreach during a period of increasing demand for specialized shipping services in emerging economies. Stolt-Nielsen's contributions culminated in his appointment as a director of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1996, where he began overseeing initial ventures into aquaculture, including the leadership of Stolt Sea Farm as its president from 1996 to 2000.[1] This role involved directing early salmon farming operations, integrating his shipping expertise with new diversification strategies in sustainable seafood production.[6] These steps not only expanded the company's portfolio but also positioned Stolt-Nielsen as a key figure in bridging maritime logistics with innovative agribusiness.[7]

CEO leadership and strategic shifts

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in November 2000, succeeding his father, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen, who had led the company since its founding in 1959.[3] Under his leadership, the company prioritized sustainable growth across its core operations in bulk-liquid logistics, including parcel tankers for chemicals and edible oils, bulk-liquid storage terminals, tank containers, and land-based aquaculture through Stolt Sea Farm.[1] This approach focused on optimizing performance, expanding asset bases, and enhancing market positions to deliver consistent financial results amid fluctuating market cycles.[8] During his tenure, Stolt-Nielsen held additional key roles that underscored his executive oversight. He served as President of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000, guiding the aquaculture division's development prior to his CEO appointment.[1] From October 2002 to March 2003, he acted as Interim Chief Executive Officer of Stolt Offshore S.A., a subsea construction and maintenance subsidiary, during a transitional period for that business.[9] These positions highlighted his hands-on involvement in diversifying and stabilizing the group's operations beyond traditional shipping.[1] A significant strategic shift under Stolt-Nielsen's leadership was the expansion into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and broader gas sectors, aligning with the company's expertise in liquid logistics and the global energy transition.[8] Through Stolt-Nielsen Gas, established as an investment arm during his tenure, the company acquired stakes in LNG infrastructure and shipping, including a controlling interest in Avenir LNG Limited, which operates a fleet of small-scale LNG carriers and bunkering vessels.[10] This diversification strengthened the portfolio's resilience, with investments in LNG storage terminals and related technologies contributing to long-term value creation despite market volatility in the sector.[8]

Transition to chairman

In January 2022, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen announced his intention to step down as Chief Executive Officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited after serving in the role since November 2000, citing the desire to introduce fresh leadership to guide the company's future.[3] He emphasized that the timing allowed the board sufficient opportunity to identify and appoint a successor while ensuring a smooth transition, reflecting his commitment to the company's ongoing success.[3] Stolt-Nielsen, who first joined the company in 1990, noted in the announcement that leading Stolt-Nielsen Limited had been a privilege, underscoring his dedication to its operations over more than three decades.[3] The succession process culminated in August 2023 with the appointment of Udo Lange as the new CEO, effective September 1, 2023.[11] Lange brought over 20 years of experience in international trade, including senior roles at FedEx Express where he led global operations in logistics and supply chain management across multiple continents.[11] This transition marked the end of Stolt-Nielsen's 23-year tenure as CEO, during which he had focused on long-term value creation in the shipping and logistics sectors.[11] Upon stepping down as CEO, Stolt-Nielsen assumed the position of Chairman of the Board of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in September 2023, subject to shareholder approval, and also joined the Audit and Compensation Committees.[1] In this new role, he continued to contribute to the company's strategic oversight, building on his extensive history since 1990 in fostering sustainable growth within the specialized shipping and related industries.[1]

Other business positions

Founding and leadership at Avance Gas

In 2007, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen founded Avance Gas AS to enter the burgeoning market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, establishing it as a specialized provider of very large gas carriers (VLGCs) capable of transporting LPG across global trade routes.[12][13] Stolt-Nielsen has served as Chairman of Avance Gas since its inception, steering the company through phases of strategic expansion in the energy shipping sector. Under his leadership, Avance Gas grew from a startup to a prominent operator, leveraging long-term charter contracts to ensure stable revenue amid volatile shipping markets.[12] Key achievements during his tenure include the fleet expansion through an orderbook of eight newbuildings announced in 2014, with deliveries increasing the fleet to 14 VLGCs by the end of 2015, which enabled Avance Gas to capture a significant share of the international LPG trade, particularly in routes connecting the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. This positioning capitalized on rising global demand for LPG as a cleaner fuel alternative, with the company's vessels achieving high utilization rates and contributing to efficient supply chain logistics for petrochemical feedstocks. By 2024, Avance Gas had established itself as a leading independent owner in the VLGC segment before the sale of its fleet to BW LPG.[13][14][15] In 2024, Avance Gas sold its fleet of 12 VLGCs to BW LPG for approximately $1.05 billion, completing Stolt-Nielsen's divestment from the company.[15]

Roles in LNG and related sectors

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen has served as a director of Golar LNG Limited since September 2015, where he contributes to the company's advancements in floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) technology and LNG carrier operations.[5] Under his board tenure, Golar has pioneered FLNG units like the Hilli Episeyo, the world's first converted FLNG vessel, which began production off Cameroon in 2018, enhancing efficient LNG liquefaction and export capabilities. His involvement aligns with Golar's strategic expansions in modular FLNG solutions, supporting global energy supply chains.[5] As Chairman of the Board of Avenir LNG Limited since October 2018, Stolt-Nielsen has guided the company's growth in small-scale LNG distribution and infrastructure development.[2] Avenir, in which Stolt-Nielsen Limited holds a majority stake, focuses on bunkering, trucking, and regasification solutions to deliver LNG to remote and industrial markets, including investments in small-scale carriers and storage terminals.[16] His leadership has supported Avenir's growth, including the expansion of its fleet of small-scale LNG carriers, with 5 vessels in operation and additional newbuildings on order by 2023, facilitating LNG as a transitional fuel for maritime and land-based applications.[17] Stolt-Nielsen's board capacities extend to related sustainable energy initiatives, such as his past presidency of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000, where aquaculture operations emphasized environmentally responsible practices that complement broader energy transition goals.[18] Since the 2010s, his strategic oversight across these LNG entities has promoted the adoption of cleaner fuels in shipping, including dual-fuel vessels and LNG bunkering infrastructure to reduce emissions in line with IMO regulations.[19] This work builds complementarily on his experience in gas carrier operations at Avance Gas.

Tax residency dispute

Emigration to London

In late December 2001, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen notified Norwegian authorities of his relocation to London, England, on December 1, 2001, where he established his primary residence.[20] This move, over a year after he had become chief executive officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited (SNL), a global shipping company headquartered in London, reflected the demands of his CEO position that required extensive international travel and oversight of operations across multiple countries.[3] The emigration was driven by professional necessities tied to SNL's worldwide activities, including frequent business engagements in the UK that necessitated a London base to facilitate efficient management and decision-making. As a result of the notification, Stolt-Nielsen ceased making tax payments to Norway, aligning his tax residency with his new circumstances in England. His lifestyle adjustments, such as maintaining a presence in London for both work and personal reasons, supported this shift away from Norwegian tax obligations.[21][22] Norwegian authorities initially accepted Stolt-Nielsen's claimed foreign residency for the tax years 2002 through 2004 due to a clerical error in processing at the Oslo tax office, which led to no Norwegian tax assessments being issued during this period. This provisional acceptance provided temporary relief from Norwegian taxation, though it stemmed from administrative oversight rather than a formal determination of residency status.[23][22]

Legal challenges and outcomes

In 2005, Norwegian tax authorities discovered a clerical error in their prior assessments of Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen's residency status, which had initially accepted his 2001 emigration notification to London for the years 2002–2004. This prompted the Oslo Tax Office to claim back taxes for the period 2001–2005, asserting that he maintained permanent residence in Frogner, Oslo, due to strong personal and familial ties to Norway.[22][23][24] Stolt-Nielsen responded by filing a lawsuit against the Norwegian Tax Administration, seeking to overturn the revised tax assessments and affirm his primary residency in London, where he conducted most of his professional and personal life. He argued that his time spent in Norway was limited and incidental, primarily for family visits and obligations, and that his center of vital interests had shifted abroad following the 2001 move.[22][25][23] In November 2007, the Oslo District Court ruled against Stolt-Nielsen on all counts, upholding the tax authorities' position that his permanent residence remained in Oslo based on factors such as ownership of a family home in Frogner, a country estate, vehicles registered in Norway, significant time spent in the country, and ongoing familial connections. The court determined that these elements demonstrated insufficient detachment from Norway to qualify as a tax emigrant, resulting in upheld tax liabilities for 2001 and 2005. Stolt-Nielsen was also ordered to cover his own legal costs of 474,000 Norwegian kroner and the state's costs of 95,000 Norwegian kroner.[22][23][26] Stolt-Nielsen appealed the decision. In December 2009, the Norwegian Supreme Court (HR-2009-2323-A) granted him partial relief by overturning the 2005 tax assessment, ruling that a declaration from UK tax authorities established his tax residency in the United Kingdom for that year under the Norway-UK tax treaty. The 2001 assessment remained upheld.[20][27]

Later developments

As of February 2023, Stolt-Nielsen relocated his tax residency from Bermuda back to Norway, citing anticipated large incomes and more favorable tax conditions in Norway compared to Bermuda.[28]",https://grokipedia.com/icon-512x512.png,N,,2026-01-12 13:05:02.561558

Havas Media Parent company Havas has been on an acquisitive streak of late but its media arm remains smaller than its holdco counterparts.
What remains to be seen is how Havas Media fares with its new joint venture with Horizon Media.
WPP Media Sports is a new practice charged with creating sponsorships, content and integrations, with GumGum and Relo Metrics as partners.","Comvergence, which hits 10 years in operation this year, has become the gold standard of measuring agencies’ success (or lack of). However, the data Digiday is citing here is only provisional. As Comvergence’s founder and CEO Olivier Gauthier explained, the data doesn’t include wins and losses not publicly announced — that final report will be issued in February, once Comvergence connects with all the agencies it tracks. (Although Gauthier acknowledges that the numbers don’t change on average more than 5% or so.)

Back to the numbers themselves. Somewhat surprising is what happened in between Publicis and WPP Media. Dentsu, it turns out, had a solid year, ending 2025 up $1.7 billion (details by holdco below), which technically puts it in second place for the year. But the gap between No.’s 1 and 2 — $9.5 billion to $1.7 billion, is cavernous to say the least.

Another surprise is third-place finisher IPG’s Mediabrands, which yielded a positive $1.6 billion, and placing it ahead of Omnicom Media, which ended 2025 up $1.2 billion — and yet Omnicom was the acquirer of IPG. If you put them together, they’d tally $2.8 billion in wins, ahead of Dentsu but still a distant second to Publicis.

Here’s a breakdown by holdco, ranked in order of total business won.

Publicis Media

It’s no secret the French holdco has been on a tear, winning Mars, Coca-Cola, Paramount, PayPal and most recently Kenvue, demolishing the competition. More importantly, it’s retained 50% of its business, according to Comvergence’s provisional totals, more than any other holdco. It lost just over $1.5 billion in media business.

Dentsu

Even though Dentsu outside of the Japanese mothership is informally on the block, it had a decent year. Although it won $1.8 billion in new business, it lost almost as much — which means its strength came from successful retention, which amounted to some $1.6 billion. Observers will be watching closely to see what happens to the former Aegis agencies that are seemingly up in the air.

IPG Mediabrands

“It’s very interesting that Mediabrands had a very good year in the U.S.,” said Gauthier. Most would agree with that sentiment, given that IPG was the acquisition target all year. It pulled in $2.4 billion in new business, but lost $1.9 billion, leaving it at a net of under $500 million — once again, successful defense helped win the day as Mediabrands held onto $1.1 billion it had to defend.

Omnicom Media

Omnicom Media really didn’t have a good year at all, which is perhaps the biggest surprise of the numbers. It’s only thanks to WPP Media’s truly awful year that distracted from this reality. Not counting retention, Omnicom Media came out just under $700 million ahead ($3 billion in wins vs. $2.3 billion in losses). To make matters worse, its retention rate was a wan 17% according to the Comvergence data, the second worse among the holdcos. It’s safe to say 2026 will be a different story as the absorption of IPG takes root — whether it’s a better or worse story remains to be seen.

Havas Media

Parent company Havas has been on an acquisitive streak of late but its media arm remains smaller than its holdco counterparts. Havas Media secured $1.4 billion in wins, lost $750 million and retained $350 million. According to Comvergence’s tallies, its retention rate was a middle-of-the-road 32%. What remains to be seen is how Havas Media fares with its new joint venture with Horizon Media. The pairing is complementary on paper, with Havas weak in the U.S. but well represented globally, and the opposite for Horizon. Gauthier said Comvergence will create a new category for that JV once it’s up and running this year.

WPP Media

And finally, WPP Media remained the punching bag of the holdcos, and with some good reason — ending the year $2 billion in the negative ($3.3 billion in wins, $6.4 billion in losses and successfully retaining only $1 billion). All that said, it’s worth noting that the Cindy Rose era of WPP was in its infancy for Q4, which is when WPP Media landed big-ticket accounts such as the U.K. government and Jaguar Land Rover (both from Omnicom). It’s also shoring up its client-side team by hiring away Angela Steele from Publicis (no easy feat to lure an exec away from the No. 1 holdco) where she had been CEO of Publicis Collective and in charge of the Verizon account. This year could bring better fortunes to the beleaguered London-based holdco.

Color by numbers

Since you’ve just had to absorb a LOT of numbers in the main story, here are two eye-popping stats that Comvergence’s Gauthier mentioned in relation to the holding companies. Together they were involved in more than 1,900 pitches across 50 countries last year, which totaled something in the neighborhood of $28 billion.

Takeoff & landing

At CES, Havas announced it will launch this spring an LLM portal called AVA, which will centralize the holdco’s access to major LLMs including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3.

Both WPP Media and Stagwell made moves in the sports arena. WPP Media Sports is a new practice charged with creating sponsorships, content and integrations, with GumGum and Relo Metrics as partners. And Stagwell, which has put on Sports Beach as a Cannes Lions activation for a few years, made it into its own marketing business unit, with multiple events scheduled over the course of 2026. Beth Sidhu, who is also Stagwell’s chief brand and communications officer, was named CEO.

Horizon Media said it will incorporate Sightly’s Brand Mentality and Model Context Protocol tools into its Blu market intelligence platform.

PMG acquired London and New York-based Digital Voices, an influencer marketing agency, in a bid to beef up its influencer and creator resources.

Independent Novus tapped Libby Morgan to be its new CEO, coming over from Merge where she was chief digital officer. Morgan replaces Melony Rios.

Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker – who worked at Allegiant before making the move to Minnesota – will only join the airline's board and serve in an advisory capacity.
In the short term, both Allegiant and Sun Country said there would be no immediate changes to upcoming Sun Country tickets, schedules, or its onboard experience.
Leaders from Sun Country and Allegiant were expected to address the proposed merger Monday morning.
Case in point: After a four-year run, Allegiant exited Minneapolis entirely just last year.","Ultra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Air announced plans Sunday to acquire Minnesota’s Sun Country Airlines in a $1.5 billion transaction, swallowing up a smaller budget airline in a move that could have major ramifications for Minnesota travelers on the hunt for bargain airfare.

The proposed merger would fold Sun Country's planes, pilots, and crews all under Allegiant's umbrella, creating one bigger budget carrier – though it would still be significantly smaller than either Spirit or Frontier, according to airline data. With a deal expected to close sometime in the second half of 2026, the combined airline would continue under Allegiant's name with its headquarters in Las Vegas.

Allegiant said it would maintain a “significant presence” in Sun Country's Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) hub after the deal closes. But a long history of airline mergers suggests that there could be reductions in Minneapolis down the road. Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker – who worked at Allegiant before making the move to Minnesota – will only join the airline's board and serve in an advisory capacity.

In the short term, both Allegiant and Sun Country said there would be no immediate changes to upcoming Sun Country tickets, schedules, or its onboard experience. Translation? Don't worry if you're booked to fly with Sun Country in the weeks and months ahead.

The deal will require approval from President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which has taken a friendlier approach to consolidation than the Biden administration that blocked several airline deals, including JetBlue's proposed takeover of Spirit Airlines. And unlike many previous mergers, Sun Country and Allegiant are both relatively small and barely overlap today, meaning regulators may see less cause for concern than other takeover attempts.

Leaders from Sun Country and Allegiant were expected to address the proposed merger Monday morning.

“This combination is an exciting next chapter in Allegiant and Sun Country’s shared mission in providing affordable, reliable, and convenient service from underserved communities to premier leisure destinations,” Allegiant CEO Gregory Anderson said in a written statement.

This merger is just the latest sign of turbulence in the U.S.'s low-cost carrier market, which has fallen out of favor in the post-pandemic travel boom. Spirit Airlines is in its second round of bankruptcy proceedings and yet another run of the rumor mill about an acquisition by Frontier.

Sun Country has been far more successful, posting profits for years as it challenged Delta's dominance in Minneapolis while branching out into flying packages for Amazon and ferrying college football teams and professional soccer squads across the country.

Sunday's surprise merger announcement could change everything.

What Allegiant's Acquisition Means for Minneapolis

If the merger moves ahead, it'll be the end of Sun Country in name: an airline with a storied yet often complicated brand.

Sun Country has been a household name in Minnesota for decades after starting up service in 1982 in the wake of Braniff International's collapse. After years of financial struggles operating as a beloved full-service hometown carrier, the airline began an unpopular transition to a low-cost model before the pandemic – complete with fees for everything from bags to seat assignments to buying your tickets at the airport and installed smaller seats, to boot. Its reputation took a major blow after stranding hundreds of passengers in Mexico in April 2018 … and never fully recovered.

Yet Sun Country prided itself on being a different kind of low-cost carrier. While it ripped out first class seats and shrank legroom throughout the cabin, its seating was better padded than the ultra-slimline seats that Frontier, Spirit, and even Allegiant use on their planes. Even as those competitors charged for water, Sun Country served free soft drinks and sold snacks and craft beers with a Minnesota flair.

As the rest of the budget airline industry struggled with higher costs and dipping demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, Sun Country grew fast, going public in 2021 and challenging Delta's dominance in Minneapolis. It turned the airport into what its CEO dubbed “a two-airline market.” Most importantly, Sun Country's $89 one-way fares have given Minnesota travelers a cheaper alternative to Delta's pricier fares but also forced the Atlanta-based airline to compete on price, bringing fares down across the board.

That's what could be at stake with this proposed merger. While they might both be budget airlines in name, they're drastically different in practice.

Overnight, complimentary drinks could disappear and over time, Sun Country's more comfortable seating could disappear, too. But bigger picture, the changes could be even more drastic.

When airlines buy one another, what they're really looking to buy is planes and pilots to fuel future growth. While Sun Country has been all-in on Minneapolis for decades, Allegiant focuses on operating flights between smaller airports all across the country – routes where it can have a monopoly and charge higher fares.

Even with the Sun Country name gone, Allegiant says it would maintain a significant presence in Minneapolis – it called the airport an “Important Base of Operations and Key Anchor City” in its press release announcing the merger. But what if Allegiant eventually decides to give up the fight against Delta and instead fly those planes between Las Vegas or southern Florida and other, smaller airports?

Aside from planes and people, the biggest win for Allegiant is swallowing up Sun Country's international service down to Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America – service Allegiant has lacked. But again, what if Allegiant decides it's better to fly down to the beach from St. Petersburg (PIE) rather than Minneapolis-St. Paul?

Sun Country has relished its role as a scrappy (and cheaper) alternative to Delta. Allegiant's entire identity is built around avoiding competition altogether. Case in point: After a four-year run, Allegiant exited Minneapolis entirely just last year.

Bricker, Sun Country's CEO for nearly a decade, won't play a large role once the transaction clears. He'll join the combined carriers' board of directors but only serve in a day-to-day advisory role to Allegiant's current CEO “to help ensure a smooth and successful integration.”

Allegiant also indicated it will continue Sun Country's cargo operations on behalf of Amazon – a major upside for the Minnesota airline the last few years as travel demand has plateaued.

· The global container ship orderbook currently stands at 26–28% of the existing fleet, one of the highest levels seen in more than a decade.
· Average global spot freight rates are expected to decline by up to 25% year-on-year, while long-term contract rates may fall by 8–12% as shippers regain negotiating leverage.
· Container shipping fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further due to oversupply, easing port congestion, and the potential return of vessels to Suez Canal routings, which would release additional effective capacity.

“While freight rates are expected to normalize sharply from recent highs, the industry is unlikely to return to pre-crisis stability due to persistent geopolitical, regulatory, and environmental risks,” says Supal Shah, CEO of Sarjak Container Lines. “2026 will bring relief on rates, but not certainty. Oversupply is structural, costs are permanently higher, and volatility is now a feature, not a phase, of global shipping.”

Key takeaways:

· Global fleet capacity is projected to grow by 3.6%–5% in 2026, significantly outpacing demand growth of 1.5%–3%, according to industry forecasts.

· The global container ship orderbook currently stands at 26–28% of the existing fleet, one of the highest levels seen in more than a decade.

· Average global spot freight rates are expected to decline by up to 25% year-on-year, while long-term contract rates may fall by 8–12% as shippers regain negotiating leverage.

· Industry-wide profitability is expected to weaken materially, with several analysts forecasting losses of up to USD 10 billion in 2026, driven by falling revenues and structurally higher operating costs.

· Container shipping fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further due to oversupply, easing port congestion, and the potential return of vessels to Suez Canal routings, which would release additional effective capacity.

· The dry bulk sector is expected to remain weak but stable, with potential upside if global trade volumes recover or geopolitical tensions ease.

· A broad return to Suez Canal transits could reduce effective global vessel demand by up to 10%, as shorter voyages free up capacity.

· Rising trade protectionism, evolving U.S. tariff regimes, and shifting supply chains remain key uncertainties that could disrupt established trade lanes and dampen demand for higher-margin cargo.

· Effective Jan. 1, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) moves to 100% emissions compliance, adding permanent cost structures to Europe-linked trade lanes and accelerating cost pass-through to shippers.

· Shippers are increasingly adopting continuous rate governance, real-time pricing analytics, and AI-driven procurement tools, moving away from rigid annual contracting cycles.

· Vessel owners are prioritizing lifecycle optimization, fuel flexibility, including LNG, methanol, and biofuels, and energy-efficiency investments to meet tightening decarbonization targets while preserving asset competitiveness.

“While 2026 is expected to bring lower freight rates and improved cost visibility for shippers, the global shipping industry remains structurally fragile. Oversupply, regulatory costs, and geopolitical uncertainty will continue to define a market that is less crisis-driven, but far from stable,” says Shah.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/melita-stockadobecom.Aimb2rqJ4U.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-12 03:59:04.876406

While the 2025 Braves weren’t good, Johnson made 45 of his 65 appearances in high-leverage spots.","In 2025, as good as Emilio Pagán and Tony Santillan were in the back of the Reds’ bullpen, the middle relief core for most of the season included pitchers who weren’t incredibly consistent, guys in their first year as a relief pitcher and rookies.

Heading into 2026, Nick Krall and the Reds’ front office made solidifying the middle relief depth in the bullpen a priority. After bringing Pagán to close and signing lefty Caleb Ferguson in December, the Reds made another notable move on Sunday by agreeing to a deal with veteran reliever Pierce Johnson, according to sources.

The deal between the Reds and Johnson was first reported by the New York Post. The terms aren’t yet known.

For a while, we’ve all been wondering when the Reds would finally add that impact bat, or even replace Austin Hays and Miguel Andujar. But the front office’s focus has clearly been on the bullpen.

“We had four guys we lost in the bullpen in Pagán (re-signed), Nick Martinez, Brent Suter and Scott Barlow,” Krall said a few weeks ago. “When you look at the guys we lost, it’s something we had to continue to solidify.”

The back of the Reds’ bullpen was great last season, but the middle relief core had its rough patches.

Graham Ashcraft had a fine year as the seventh-inning guy as he made the transition to the bullpen, but he was on the injured list twice and finished the season with a 3.99 ERA. Scott Barlow was more of a workhorse than a late-game weapon. Lyon Richardson, Luis Mey and Connor Phillips got their chances to pitch high-leverage innings, and only Phillips stuck. Nick Martinez, Chase Burns and Phillips took the bullpen up a level in September, but Martinez is a free agent right now, Chase Burns is going back to the rotation and Phillips is still inexperienced.

The Reds’ bullpen looks pretty set right now. The leverage guys are Pagán, Santillan, Johnson, Ashcraft and Ferguson (the lefty). The Reds guaranteed money to Moll back in November, and it’s always good to have a second lefty. Phillips put himself in a great position to break camp with the big league club with how good he looked down the stretch last season.

That could lead to a competition for the final spot between Zach Maxwell, Luis Mey, Yosver Zulueta, Richardson (no longer on the 40-man but still in the organization) and non-roster invitees like Josh Staumont.

Before signing Johnson, the Reds didn’t have a right-handed middle relief veteran in the mold of Barlow, Martinez, Buck Farmer or Fernando Cruz. While those relievers had different levels of ability and upside, you could mostly count on them to make 60+ appearances a year. You need a certain level of stability to get you through the season and to keep you from having to regularly restock your bullpen with roster moves to provide fresh arms.

Johnson fits that mold, and he has also proven to be a capable leverage reliever on a good team.

While the 2025 Braves weren’t good, Johnson made 45 of his 65 appearances in high-leverage spots.

On a playoff team in Atlanta in 2024, Johnson was consistently a late-game option in big moments and pitched the eighth inning of a close win-or-go-home postseason game. On a 2023 Braves team that won 104 games, Johnson joined the squad at the trade deadline and quickly became a leverage guy.

It took a bit for Johnson to find his footing in MLB. But once he went all-in on his curveball (he threw more curveballs than any reliever in all of baseball last season and uses the pitch 72% of the time), Johnson leveled up.

Heading into the 2024 season, he re-signed with Atlanta on a two-year deal for $14.25 million. And then he went on to have two seasons that were as good or better than what he had done before. In 2025, Johnson posted career highs (over a full season) in ERA, WAR and many advanced metrics.

Johnson fills up the strike zone, giving the Reds a good combination of durability, reliability and late-game usefulness.

A few weeks ago, after adding outfielders JJ Bleday and Dane Myers, Krall said, “We’ve got some more money to be able to use.” Since then, the Reds freed up a bit of money by DFAing Keegan Thompson ($1.4 million) and by finalizing the salaries of most of their arbitration eligible players (by my estimation that could account for about $1 million of added financial flexibility).

Before the Johnson move, my projections had the Reds at $111 million of payroll for 2026. They were in the $116 million range last season, and 2026 payroll is expected to be pretty close to what it was last season.

A few weeks ago, when asked what the Reds could use their remaining financial flexibility to add this winter, Krall said, “Bullpen depth and some offense.”

Signing Johnson takes care of the bullpen depth. Assuming they still have a bit of financial flexibility (that will become clearer as the terms are known for Johnson), the Reds could be in the market for a first baseman or an outfielder.

In the level of free agency the Reds are working at (they’re not signing Kyle Tucker), bringing back Hays would feel like a win and a great case scenario for them.

First baseman Nathaniel Lowe, Paul Goldschmidt and Rhys Hoskins are free agents.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r1YA!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c25d83-f341-4fd7-8b2a-e8e014f85006_1578x886.png",N,,2026-01-11 21:58:34.407073

The company’s leadership in metabolic disease, anchored by its high profile weight loss and diabetes therapies, has reshaped growth expectations while delivering measurable benefits to society. With accelerating earnings, expanding margins, and a robust late stage pipeline, Lilly offers a compelling blend of return potential and real world impact that firmly qualifies it for the Good Stocks universe.

The Return Case

Lilly’s investment appeal rests on a powerful combination of accelerating revenue growth, operating leverage, and exceptional profitability. With profit growth forecast above 100 percent and industry leading margins, earnings momentum remains the central driver of long term shareholder returns.

The Impact Case

Beyond financials, Lilly’s therapies are redefining how obesity and metabolic disease are treated globally. At the same time, strong resource efficiency and high recycling rates reinforce the company’s standing as a responsible operator across its value chain.

Company Profile: A Science First Growth Engine

Eli Lilly is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on diabetes, obesity, oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Its portfolio includes some of the most impactful medicines of the past decade, supported by deep expertise in biologics, peptide chemistry, and large scale manufacturing.

The company’s most visible products today are its GLP 1 based therapies for diabetes and weight management, which have seen unprecedented demand. These medicines address conditions that affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and are increasingly viewed as foundational treatments rather than niche interventions.

From a market perspective, Lilly operates in therapeutic areas with durable, above average growth. Obesity treatment alone is evolving into one of the largest pharmaceutical markets globally. Lilly’s competitive moat is built on first mover scale, manufacturing capacity, strong clinical data, and a pipeline that extends well beyond its current blockbusters. This combination makes its market position defensible even as competition intensifies.

Financial Analysis: Growth Justifying the Premium

Multi Year Performance and Recent Momentum

Over the past five years, Lilly has delivered steady revenue growth that has recently accelerated sharply. Revenue growth rose from low double digits earlier in the cycle to over 30 percent in the most recent year, with trailing twelve month growth exceeding 45 percent. EBITDA and earnings growth have accelerated even more dramatically, reflecting operating leverage as volumes scale.

Margins tell the same story. EBITDA margins have expanded into the low 40 percent range, while net profit margins now exceed 30 percent on a trailing basis. Returns on equity and assets are among the highest in the pharmaceutical industry, underscoring efficient capital deployment.

Valuation in Context

At first glance, Lilly’s valuation appears demanding. The stock trades at a forward price to earnings multiple in the mid to high 40s, well above the sector average. However, valuation looks more reasonable when set against growth. Earnings per share growth is forecast above 100 percent in the near term, and revenue growth is expected to remain well above the company’s long term average.

Importantly, the growth trajectory is accelerating rather than decelerating. The step change driven by metabolic therapies has not yet fully flowed through earnings, suggesting that near term multiple compression may be offset by rapid earnings expansion.

Growth Drivers and Industry KPIs

Key industry specific indicators support this outlook. Prescription volumes for Lilly’s weight loss and diabetes drugs continue to rise, capacity expansions are coming online, and demand remains supply constrained in several markets. Unlike many pharmaceutical growth stories, this momentum is driven by real world utilization rather than pricing alone.

Analyst Expectations and Upside

Consensus analyst targets imply modest single digit upside from current levels. That may appear conservative, but it reflects the stock’s strong recent performance rather than deteriorating fundamentals. With a Ziggma Score of 88, supported by profitability at 95 and financial health at 97, Lilly remains one of the highest quality profiles in global healthcare.

Risks to the Return Scenario

The primary risks center on competition, pricing pressure, and execution. Rival therapies could narrow Lilly’s market share over time. Regulatory scrutiny around drug pricing may intensify. Manufacturing scale up must continue without disruption. Finally, expectations are high, which increases sensitivity to any earnings disappointment.

Risks to the Return Scenario

If Lilly sustains current growth rates for longer than expected, earnings expansion alone could drive meaningful upside even with stable valuation multiples.

Impact Analysis: Medicines That Change Lives

Tackling Obesity at Scale

Lilly’s weight loss therapies represent one of the most significant medical advances in decades. Obesity is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reduced life expectancy. By enabling substantial and sustained weight loss, these drugs have the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality of life for millions.

Responsible Resource Use

Beyond patient impact, Lilly scores highly on Sustainable Resource Use, with an especially strong recycling rate that drives its elevated score in this category. Efficient water use and waste management reflect disciplined operational practices that reduce environmental footprint across manufacturing sites.

Investment Thesis: Quality Growth with Real World Impact

Lilly’s investment case is built on three pillars. First, a step change in growth driven by category defining metabolic therapies. Second, best in class profitability and financial strength that allow the company to reinvest at scale. Third, tangible societal benefits that reinforce long term license to operate.

Over the next two to three years, earnings growth is likely to remain the dominant driver of returns. Even if valuation multiples normalize modestly, earnings expansion can support continued share price appreciation. Crucially, this growth is underpinned by products that deliver clear benefits to patients and healthcare systems worldwide.

LLY Is Where Innovation and Impact Reinforce Returns

Eli Lilly exemplifies what a Good Stock should look like. It pairs industry leading growth and profitability with therapies that address some of the most pressing health challenges of our time. While valuation is no longer cheap, the company’s accelerating growth trajectory, operational excellence, and profound societal impact make a compelling case for long term investors seeking both returns and purpose.

After a slow start, Google's AI chatbot is rapidly gaining users, topping AI benchmark leaderboards, and forcing its biggest competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT, into ""code red"" emergencies.

Now, in another big leap, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is partnering with Gemini on a new shopping experience — similar to one it struck with ChatGPT in October.

When people use Gemini to ask questions or search, the assistant will now automatically recommend relevant products from Walmart and Sam's Club, drawing on users' past online and in-store purchases, Walmart said in a press release on Sunday.

For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes.

Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it,"" Furner said in the press release.

In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience.

AI is reshaping the discovery process even further.

Gemini 3 plays catch-up

While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways.

In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3.

The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter ""insane"" in a viral post.

The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a ""code red"" at his company.

Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV.

The protocol battle

Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol.

""AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. ""To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey.""

Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider.

OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature.

OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is ""an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases."" It was developed alongside Stripe.

Google's mission appears to be similar.

In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol.

In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience.

He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said.",https://i.insider.com/69641e5d764ca5f34d2a3c21?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 20:58:50.351734

Any shift in capital requirements or banking sector taxes can quickly change the earnings equation for institutions like Société Générale.","Few European bank stocks divide opinion quite as sharply right now as Société Générale. The French lender’s share price has moved only modestly over the past week, but the subdued price action hides a much more polarised debate over capital strength, restructuring risks and how much patience the market still has with management’s long game.

Société Générale S.A. stock: deep dive into valuation, strategy and risks for global investors

On the screen, Société Générale S.A. (ISIN FR0000130809) trades around the mid 20 euro area, according to live quotes from Yahoo Finance and Reuters. Intraday charts show a mostly sideways drift over the last five sessions, with small daily swings rather than the kind of trend that excites momentum traders. The short term sentiment is cautious rather than panicked, a market that is watching and waiting rather than one rushing for the exits.

Across the last five trading days, the stock has oscillated within a relatively narrow band, with closing levels moving only modestly up and down compared with the prior week. There were no dramatic gap moves or outsized volume spikes, and the tape suggests that both buyers and sellers are testing the range rather than forcing a breakout. In other words, price is calm, but conviction is scarce.

Zooming out to roughly three months, the picture becomes more nuanced. From the early autumn period to now, Société Générale has traded on a choppy upward-sloping path, supported by the broader rally in European financials as investors warmed again to higher interest rate margins. Yet every attempt to push decisively higher has met a wall of profit taking, reflecting lingering doubts over the bank’s earnings quality and execution on its restructuring promises.

The 52 week range underlines this divide. According to Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance, Société Générale’s stock has carved out a low in the high teens and a high in the low 30s over the past year, a wide corridor that captures both deep pessimism during periods of sector stress and bouts of optimism when European banks briefly came back into fashion. The current quote sits somewhere in the middle of that band, which is precisely where disagreement between bulls and bears tends to be most intense.

One-Year Investment Performance

If an investor had bought Société Générale stock exactly one year ago, the experience would have been a roller coaster with a mildly positive payoff at today’s levels. Based on closing prices from Reuters and Investing.com, the share traded in the low 20s at that time. With the stock now around the mid 20s, that translates into a gain in the low double digits in percentage terms for the period, before dividends.

Put differently, a hypothetical 10,000 euro position taken then would be worth roughly 11,000 euro today, not including the bank’s cash distributions. That is hardly the kind of explosive performance one might find in hot tech names, but in the conservative world of European banking, a double digit total return over twelve months is not trivial. The emotional journey, however, was anything but smooth: investors had to stomach sharp drawdowns during bouts of risk aversion and controversy around the group’s Russian exposure and capital allocation plans.

This backdrop explains why the prevailing sentiment feels closer to cautious optimism than outright euphoria. The stock has rewarded patient holders, but the gains came with enough volatility and negative headlines that many portfolio managers still view Société Générale as a name that needs constant babysitting. For value oriented investors, the past year reinforces the idea that entry timing matters enormously with this stock.

Recent Catalysts and News

In the last several days, the news flow around Société Générale has been relatively sparse in terms of blockbuster headlines, but not entirely devoid of signals. Earlier this week, sector wide commentary on European banks from major brokers highlighted French lenders as a mixed bag, citing solid capital buffers but also warning about margin pressure as the rate cycle turns. Société Générale often featured in those notes as a restructuring story with more moving parts than some peers.

More recently, French press and international financial media picked up on incremental updates around the bank’s cost cutting program and simplification of its business portfolio. While there were no new transformational deals or large scale disposals announced in the last few days, analysts continued to reference management’s prior commitments on reducing risk weighted assets and focusing on core franchises such as French retail, corporate and investment banking, and its African operations.

Because there has been no fresh quarterly earnings release or major management change in the past week, trading has been driven mostly by macro headlines, rate expectations, and shifting views on the overall European banking sector. In that sense, Société Générale has behaved more like a macro proxy than a single stock with unique news. If the news drought persists, the market may continue to treat it as part of a basket trade on euro area growth and capital requirements rather than a company specific story.

Should the current lull in company specific headlines extend beyond the next reporting cycle, traders will increasingly talk about a consolidation phase, with low volatility and declining volumes as investors wait for the next catalyst. For short term players, such phases are often frustrating, but for longer term buyers they can be an opportunity to build positions away from the noise that follows big announcements.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

The analyst community remains genuinely split on Société Générale, and the last month of research updates has not resolved that divide. According to recent reports surfaced via Bloomberg and MarketWatch, houses such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have adjusted their views on European banks, with Société Générale typically sitting in the middle of their recommendation spectrums.

Goldman Sachs, in its latest coverage of large euro area banks, keeps a neutral stance on Société Générale, effectively a Hold, with a price target that sits somewhat above the current market price but not enough to suggest a high conviction Buy. Their analysts emphasise the potential for capital return through dividends and buybacks, but flag execution risk around disposals and the cost base.

JPMorgan’s most recent note on French banks, issued within the last few weeks, takes a slightly more constructive angle, tilting toward an overweight view for investors who can tolerate restructuring risk. Their price objective points to a more meaningful upside relative to today’s level, but is still framed within a broader caution about the sector’s sensitivity to growth and regulation.

Deutsche Bank and UBS, meanwhile, have tended to hover around Hold on Société Générale, with price targets clustered in a band bracketing the current quote. They highlight that valuation multiples, based on price to tangible book value and earnings, look undemanding compared with history and some peers, yet they hesitate to move to full Buy recommendations until they see a cleaner earnings trajectory and further delivery on the strategic plan.

Aggregating those perspectives, the Street verdict can best be described as a guarded Hold with pockets of selective Buy. The consensus target price sits comfortably above the present trading price, pointing to moderate upside, but the language in the notes makes clear that this is a show me story rather than a blind faith bet. For retail investors reading between the lines, that means analysts see potential, but they also see enough ways for the story to disappoint that they are not pounding the table.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Société Générale’s business model is a complex blend of French retail banking, corporate and investment banking, international retail franchises and specialised financial services. The strategic thrust in recent years has been to simplify this portfolio, shed non core or capital intensive activities, and redeploy resources toward areas where the bank can earn attractive returns without stretching its balance sheet.

Looking ahead, several factors will determine whether the stock breaks decisively higher or slips back toward the lower end of its 52 week range. First, the interest rate environment remains crucial: a faster than expected easing cycle in Europe could compress net interest margins faster than management can offset through volume growth or cost savings. Second, the credibility of the cost cutting and restructuring agenda will be tested quarter by quarter, as investors demand concrete evidence of improved efficiency rather than merely promises.

Third, regulatory and political risk in France and the wider euro area will continue to cast a shadow. Any shift in capital requirements or banking sector taxes can quickly change the earnings equation for institutions like Société Générale. On the positive side, the bank’s relatively strong capital ratios and its track record of managing through past crises provide a cushion that value investors take seriously.

In the coming months, the most plausible base case is a stock that fluctuates within a broad band, with occasional bursts of optimism around results or strategic milestones. If management delivers cleaner earnings, hits its capital and cost targets, and avoids fresh controversy, the market could gradually rerate the shares toward the upper half of their recent range. If, however, macro conditions deteriorate or the restructuring drags on without clear payoff, the patience of today’s cautious optimists may wear thin, and the balance of sentiment could tilt back toward the bears.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404989_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 18:13:34.990349

Turning Policy into Practice The Korea–HP partnership demonstrates that global innovation is no longer confined to regional clusters.
By embedding HP Garage 2.0 into Korea’s AroundX framework, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups is creating a new template for public–private co-development.","Korea’s global startup diplomacy is turning into tangible infrastructure. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups (MSS) has joined hands with HP to bring Silicon Valley’s “garage innovation” model to Korean soil. Through the AroundX global open innovation program, the partnership will enable Korean startups in AI and data science to build, test, and scale with real-world access to HP’s global networks and technology base.

MSS and HP Sign MOU to Accelerate AI and Data Startups

Vice Minister Noh Yong-seok of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups met with David McQuarrie, Chief Commercial Officer of HP Inc., at HP’s U.S. headquarters on January 9 (local time) to discuss collaboration in the startup sector.

Following the meeting, the Korea Institute of Startup and Entrepreneurship Development (KISED) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with HP to jointly operate the AroundX Global Corporate Collaboration Program, marking HP’s official participation in the initiative starting 2026.

Under the agreement, both sides will strengthen cooperation to enhance the global competitiveness of Korean startups in AI and data science and support their entry into international markets through HP Garage 2.0, the company’s global open innovation and startup acceleration platform.

The Garage Spirit Meets AroundX

HP’s participation represents more than a corporate alliance, reflecting a bridge between Korea’s policy-driven innovation model and Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial DNA.

HP has operated its “HP Garage 2.0” program to cultivate startups based on the founding spirit of its 1939 Palo Alto garage, long regarded as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. The program connects early-stage innovators to HP’s R&D infrastructure and commercialization expertise across the global market.

By localizing HP Garage 2.0 through AroundX, the MSS aims to translate the symbolic “garage innovation” culture into a structured Korean model—where startups receive both policy backing and corporate collaboration under a single framework.

Statements from the Stakeholders on the Partnerships

David McQuarrie, Chief Commercial Officer of HP, said:

“Korea has one of the most dynamic ecosystems in AI and data science. Through this partnership, we will leverage HP’s global network and technological capabilities to collaborate with outstanding Korean startups and create new innovation opportunities.”

Noh Yong-seok, First Vice Minister of SMEs and Startups, stated:

“It is deeply meaningful to work with HP, a company that embodies the entrepreneurial spirit that created Silicon Valley. Through the AroundX ‘HP Garage 2.0’ program, we aim to help Korean startups expand globally and foster the next generation of world-class companies.”

How AroundX Becomes the Core of Korea’s Global Innovation Network

The AroundX Program, launched by the MSS in 2019, has grown into one of Korea’s most comprehensive public–private platforms for cross-border startup cooperation. It connects domestic startups with multinational corporations such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, Oracle, and Intel, enabling proof-of-concept (PoC) projects, co-marketing, and localized R&D collaboration.

With HP joining alongside OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, and Astellas, the program now extends across AI, mobility, and biotechnology. AroundX’s evolution represents Korea’s broader transition from isolated pilot projects to ecosystem-level global partnerships—where collaboration becomes an operating model, not a single event.

HP’s collaboration with the MSS marks a deeper layer of Korea’s global startup expansion strategy. It moves policy cooperation beyond memorandums and conferences into sustained, structural partnerships.

For AI and data startups, this alliance provides practical access to HP’s research ecosystem and international markets, while for Korea, it symbolizes the transformation of its startup policy from government-driven support to co-owned global execution.

Industry analysts view the AroundX–HP partnership as a case study in how governments can transform startup diplomacy into global infrastructure—linking Korea’s venture ecosystem to the innovation networks of Silicon Valley, Europe, and beyond.

Turning Policy into Practice

The Korea–HP partnership demonstrates that global innovation is no longer confined to regional clusters. By embedding HP Garage 2.0 into Korea’s AroundX framework, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups is creating a new template for public–private co-development.

For Korean founders and investors, this partnership represents access not just to mentorship but to the infrastructure of global commercialization. It also reaffirms Korea’s trajectory toward becoming a deep-tech hub of the Asia-Pacific, where government policy, corporate innovation, and startup ambition meet in a shared ecosystem of scale.",https://koreatechdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Korea-and-HP-Unite-to-Build-the-Next-Global-AI-Powerhouses-Through-AroundX-and-Garage-2.0.-COVER.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 18:59:28.516747

The foundation AI model company’s Claude for Healthcare offering comes on the heels of Claude for Life Sciences, which it launched in October. The announcement, made in conjunction with the kickoff of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, marks Anthropic’s continued foray into regulated, high-stakes clinical environments.

Claude for Healthcare features HIPAA-ready infrastructure for enterprise customers, models trained specifically for healthcare and life sciences tasks and native integrations to commonly-used medical and scientific databases, including the CMS Coverage Database, ICD-10 codes and PubMed, according to the company.

The AI safety and research company also announced new capabilities for life sciences, extending from preclinical R&D into clinical operations and regulatory affairs.

The new capabilities mark Anthropic’s first foray in healthcare, but the company clearly sees big opportunities in the space.

Healthcare and life sciences represent one of Anthropic’s largest bets, Eric Kauderer-Abrams, head of biology and life sciences at Anthropic, told Fierce Healthcare.

The company's move into healthcare follows OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Health last week, which is a hub to let users upload their medical records, as well as OpenAI for Healthcare as a suite of tools for healthcare enterprises.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives and senior research staff in 2021, developed a family of large language models called Claude.

Claude for Healthcare is built around Anthropic’s existing AI models but with connections to tools like medical databases and coding systems that make medical information easier to find, access and understand. With a HIPAA-ready infrastructure, healthcare organizations can deploy Claude for workflows involving protected health information like prior authorization for the first time, according to executives.

“These are not new models or even new products. What we're announcing is a coherent set of connectors so that Claude our models and Claude our products, however you're accessing Claude, whether it's through the chat interface or through Claude code or our enterprise offering, have the connections to the tools that professionals in healthcare and life sciences are using every day so that it can accelerate all the work they're doing, have all the context that they need to have and be present as a collaborator throughout the whole process, and function as a real amplifier of human capabilities,” Kauderer-Abrams said.

He added, “Our approach is to build useful tools and connections and make sure that our models are at a superhuman-level in all these use cases for payers, providers and health systems and for consumers as well. For life sciences, it’s about making sure that our models have skills spanning everything from the early-stage discovery through translation and commercialization, and that they connect to the tools that scientists and life science professionals are using every day.”

Kauderer-Abrams stressed that Anthropic is laser-focused on supporting AI for enterprise customers in healthcare rather than consumer health applications.

The company asserts that its commitment to building safe, responsible AI makes it uniquely suited to work with health systems, hospitals, payers and other healthcare organizations.

“Anthropic is a very natural fit for the healthcare and life sciences world because our identity as an AI company is built around safety and responsibility and rigor and reproducibility, and these are all the central tenants of the healthcare and life sciences industries,” he noted.

There are a number of pharma companies, health systems and startups already using Claude’s suite of LLMs—Banner Health, Stanford Healthcare, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, AbbVie and Genmab—to automate administrative workflows like clinical documentation, regulatory submissions and clinical trial analysis.

“We were drawn to Anthropic's focus on AI safety and Claude's Constitutional AI approach to creating more helpful, harmless, and honest AI systems,” said Mike Reagin, chief technology officer at Banner Health, in a statement.

“Safety is non-negotiable in healthcare. Anthropic has been a clear leader in building models with strong safety foundations,” said Justin Norden, M.D., co-founder of startup Qualified Health.

“A big piece of the challenge of using AI in healthcare is there's basically no room for error. The cost of hallucinations, for example, or even the cost of non-reproducible analyzes is very high. We’ve done a lot of work to solve those problems,” Kauderer-Abrams said.

Anthropic uses specific technical methods during production model training to reduce the frequency of hallucinations and works to ensure that the results pulled from medical databases are accurate, cited and reproducible, he noted.

Anthropic boosted its life sciences AI leadership when it brought Kauderer-Abrams on board six months ago. The executive’s resume includes co-founding several computational biology startups.

With Claude for Healthcare, enterprise healthcare integrations now enable Claude to pull information from industry-standard systems and databases, meaning that clinicians and administrators can save time finding the data and generating the reports they need, executives said. Claude now connects to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database, including both Local and National Coverage Determinations. This enables Claude to verify coverage requirements, support prior auth workflows, reduce claim denials and surface regional coverage differences, according to the company.

Claude also connects to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to look up both diagnosis and procedure codes to support medical coding, billing accuracy and claims management; the National Provider Identifier Registry, to help with provider verification, credentialing, networking directory management and claims validation; as well as PubMed, which provides access to more than 35 million pieces of biomedical literature.

The company also added new Agent Skills for FHIR Development to help developers connect healthcare systems faster and with fewer errors, improving the interoperability of medical data, executives said.

Claude for Healthcare’s HIPAA-ready infrastructure gives healthcare organizations a “plug-and-play” solution, Kauderer-Abrams said.

“A big part about being useful in healthcare and life sciences is respecting the intense compliance requirements that are there, and with good reason. We’re offering our solutions in a HIPAA-compliant way so that you can build applications around them, and so that you can do so in a way that respects all the relevant regulations. We're also the only major foundation model that's available through all of the major cloud providers,” he said.

The new AI tools available through Claude can support healthcare startups building new products as well as large enterprise health systems looking to integrate AI deeply into their operations, the company claims. By quickly pulling relevant information from coverage requirements, patient records and clinical guidelines, these AI resources can help organizations with time-intensive, burdensome administrative tasks like prior authorization requests and claims appeals and can also support care coordination and triage patient messages, Anthropic executives said.

“It’s really about amplifying the capabilities of the professionals in these healthcare organizations, so allowing you to be more productive, and allowing AI to take some of the grunt work off your plate and do it more efficiently and quickly. There is a huge amount of headroom to be had in terms of lessening the administrative burden,” Kauderer-Abrams said. “It's about the model being useful end-to-end, throughout all the processes, connecting to the tools that you use in your enterprise, operating in it natively as you do.”

Claude for Healthcare also includes consumer health integrations to enable individuals to share their health information as well as fitness and wellness data from different apps. Individuals can use Claude to summarize their medical history, understand test results in plain language, spot patterns across fitness and health metrics or prep questions for doctor appointments, according to Anthropic.

In the U.S., Claude Pro and Max plan subscribers can give Claude secure access to their lab results and health records. New HealthEx and Function connectors are now available in beta, while Apple Health and Android Health Connect integrations are rolling out in beta this week via the Claude iOS and Android apps.

Providers and healthcare companies have long had ambitions to collect patients’ health information all in one place—a longitudinal health record that makes it easier for patients to manage their health. But it’s been a bumpy road. Microsoft and Google both launched personal health record offerings but then shut them down.

Kauderer-Abrams is bullish that AI can finally make this happen.

“I’m excited about this idea of taking all of the context that you have about patients that are scattered throughout all these different places and having one system that can consolidate it all and connect natively into all the tools that are present in these healthcare systems to make care delivery more effective and more efficient,” he said. “Maybe we were all a bit misguided in trying to put all of the health at records in one place. That's too hard. Make the models go and do the hard work of figuring out how to interface and communicate and make sure all the connections are in place. That’s why I'm optimistic that the problem is solvable now is that there's been this unlocking intelligence.”

On the life sciences side, Anthropic is adding connectors to clinical trial solutions company Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, life sciences preprint servers bioRxiv & medRxiv, Open Targets, ChEMBL and Owkin.

The existing life sciences connectors include Benchling, 10x Genomics, PubMed, BioRender, Synapse.org and Wiley Scholar Gateway.

“On the life sciences side, I'm really excited to get to the point where you can have Claude as that collaborator through all stages of the R&D process and where Claude can take on increasingly large chunks of work and be increasingly autonomous,” Kauderer-Abrams said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/Logo%20card%20-%20Multi%20-%20Clay.jpg?VersionId=U.PpJDP4VGU9aZFbHX7IguNEHItqxH5T,N,,2026-01-11 18:13:31.002966

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

This is one you’ll never forget.” As he has often been in his first season as head coach, Johnson was right.
But what does that mean to a Bears team that scored 10 points in two minutes to beat Green Bay in Week 16?
“So this one meant something to us.” The rivalry is alive and well, and the Bears’ coach is fanning its flames.
To his first playoff win as Chicago Bears head coach.” Williams gave the ball to Johnson and the two embraced.","CHICAGO — When the Chicago Bears faced an 18-point halftime deficit and had been thoroughly dominated for two quarters, head coach Ben Johnson had an ambitious message for his team.

“We’re gonna have the greatest comeback in Bears history,” tight end Cole Kmet said, relaying Johnson’s halftime proclamation after the 31-27 wild-card win against the Green Bay Packers. “And we did.”

The 2025 Bears are accustomed to comeback wins, but this?

The Packers had averaged 7.2 yards per play through two quarters. Quarterback Jordan Love already had three touchdown passes. Four Packers had a run for more than 10 yards — the Bears’ longest run went for 9 yards.

Quarterback Caleb Williams was 8-for-17 passing with an interception. Green Bay was 3-for-3 in the red zone. The Bears were 4-for-9 on third down. Starting linebacker T.J. Edwards left the game and would not return.

And the Packers would start the second half with the football.

“I said it to you at halftime,” Johnson told the team in his postgame speech, “this is one you’ll never forget. This is one you’ll never forget.”

As he has often been in his first season as head coach, Johnson was right.

This is a team that has prided itself on not flinching and not panicking. At times in the first half, it didn’t look that way, whether it was offensive miscues, turning it over on downs, or giving up big plays. But Johnson leaned on the experience and belief they had to rally back. The message hit.

“It was the only option we had was to go out there and be legendary, to go out there and execute, to go out there and do our part on the offensive side, defensive side and special teams,” Williams said. “Have each other’s back, go win the effing game.”

During training camp, Johnson showed the team Super Bowl LI, when the New England Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28.

Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett played for the Falcons that day, and guard Joe Thuney played for the Patriots. Johnson had those players speak about their perspectives.

“It’s a good lesson to be learned that you know it’s 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game still being played, there’s a lot of time left,” Johnson said Saturday night. “That was my message to the group was just reminding them that this has been done before and rather than saying, ‘Woe is me’ and ‘Crap, we’re in a hole,’ it’s more this is a great opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we’ll never forget, and that’s what he did.”

When he told them to do something legendary, he could remind them of that Super Bowl. Anything can happen.

Kmet said the response wasn’t necessarily a rah-rah but more business-like.

“It’s just like all right,” he said, “let’s go do it.”

They had done it time and time again, including against this Packers team in this building three weeks earlier. Belief wasn’t an issue. That had been built.

When the defense forced three consecutive punts and the offense responded with only six points, though, that hope could waver.

But that’s where Johnson’s other message came in: one play at a time. That’s a familiar one to the players.

“That’s the message since April; it hasn’t changed,” Kmet said. “And every play matters and your assignment, doing your job matters, and that’s stressed and that’s highlighted. You know, not only the big plays that are made down the field by the guys with the ball in their hands, but you know, by the guys on the back side of the play, what they’re doing. That matters just as much, and that’s stressed, that’s emphasized. I think everyone in here takes it to heart.”

Running back D’Andre Swift’s touchdown with 10 minutes to go, which cut the deficit to 21-16, got the stadium rocking. They chipped away, played complementary football, and suddenly it was a whole new ballgame.

Then the Packers went up 11 points on the ensuing drive. But what does that mean to a Bears team that scored 10 points in two minutes to beat Green Bay in Week 16? They just had to go one play at a time.

“Every team’s different, but certainly it seemed to resonate with those guys, you know,” Johnson said. “And they did a great job. The only way you come back from a deficit like that is one possession at a time, trying to get more points on the scoreboard. Continuing to hold them and get the ball back to the offense.

“Special teams played a major factor in this game as well throughout. And so, yeah, you got no other choice. You’re not gonna get it all back all in one shot. And so yeah, just keep plugging along. And I think we had a couple field goals to get us going a little bit. And then the touchdowns eventually broke the dam.”

The players had to make sensational plays, like Williams’ throw to receiver Rome Odunze on fourth down and the touchdown to receiver DJ Moore, the defensive stops and pressure that forced Jordan Love to get out of his comfort zone.

Don’t tell the players they’re the benefit of luck, either. They’ve won this way too many times.

“To be in those situations and to come out victorious, it’s no fluke,” Williams said. “It’s no, ‘Oh, this happened, we’re lucky.’ We’ve done it multiple times this year. It’s been proven for us to be a great second-half team.”

Even trailing by three scores at halftime when it seemed like nothing was working, they knew if they could just get it to a one-score game…

“No f—ing panic,” Johnson said in the postgame celebration. “Built for pressure. That’s you guys.”

Johnson doesn’t show much emotion on the sideline. It creates quite the juxtaposition between in-game Johnson and postgame Johnson, yelling the team’s victory mantra, “Good, better, best.”

But after this win, the largest comeback in franchise postseason history, Johnson pumped his fist. He celebrated with Odunze, falling to the ground.

Sure, why wouldn’t he finally let loose and celebrate his first playoff win? But Johnson likes to be the same guy no matter what. This one had extra meaning.

“There was probably a bit more noise coming out of their building up north to start the week, which we heard loud and clear, players and coaches alike,” he said. “So this one meant something to us.”

The rivalry is alive and well, and the Bears’ coach is fanning its flames. He got the last laugh, so why not?

After Williams received a game ball from Johnson, he turned to his head coach and addressed the team.

“Everything he’s done for us as a coach, everything the other coaches have done for us — it started with him bringing everyone in,” he said. “For me personally, he’s been — (I’m) getting emotional — monumental in my life so far. To his first playoff win as Chicago Bears head coach.”

Williams gave the ball to Johnson and the two embraced. It’s a duo Bears fans hope can be playing football deep into January for a long time. This is just Year 1, and on a night when most would have counted them out, Williams and his teammates answered their coach’s message at halftime.

They completed the greatest postseason comeback in Bears history.

“We got a group of guys that just, they don’t waver if the odds are stacked against us,” Johnson said. “Despite the fact that we don’t like that score at halftime, nobody does. No one envisioned the first 30 minutes going that way. And yet, we just keep plugging along and we keep fighting. And we’ve proven that this year. That’s who we are and that’s what we do here at this point.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/11034337/USATSI_27982812-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-11 14:59:20.572361

Jensen Huang explains why the AI ""bubble"" debate misses the point

Fears about the AI bubble are growing louder as spending numbers surge and stock valuations skyrocket.

For perspective, Nvidia stock boasts a market cap of about $4.5 trillion, having added more than $1 trillion since the start of 2025.

Despite those jaw-dropping figures, Huang feels investors are looking at it the wrong way. He says what looks like excess is actually the early phase of a deeper shift in computing itself.

Clearly, AI spending is enormous, which can be seen from the latest capex figures from the Big 3 hyperscalers:

Amazon (AWS): CFO Brian Olsavsky said the tech giant expects full-year 2025 capex of nearly $125 billion (and higher in 2026), largely due to AI projects, Reuters reported.

Microsoft (Azure): Microsoft reported nearly $35 billion in capex in its fiscal Q1 2026, according to Reuters, warning that spending will continue rising as it builds AI data-center capacity.

Alphabet (Google Cloud): Alphabet bumped 2025 capex guidance to a whopping $91 billion to $93 billion, linked to AI/cloud demand. (Source:Reuters)

Additionally, Huang describes AI as a wholesale shift from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing, spearheaded by AI agents, models, and applications that are layered above that foundation.

Additionally, Huang pushed back on the concerns that Nvidia’s ecosystem investing creates some systemic risk.

Given the current dynamics, TSMC controls the bottlenecks in the AI supply chain, and that rare pricing power is showing its fundamentals.

As of Q3 2025, HBM made up a massive 57% of sales, with its cutting-edge 3nm nodes at 23% of wafer sales only a few quarters into ramp.

Also, as we witness a ramp-up in 2nm wafer production soon, and them being priced over $30,000 along with 5%–10% hikes on sub-5nm nodes, customers like Nvidia and Apple have little choice but to pay.

Located on Shanley Street, the property footprint has a total site area of 66,960m2, building improvements of 15,702m2, and a permit approved for further development.
The company successfully applied for a permit to construct another 7000m2 building out the front of the existing building.
""There is three megawatts of power that goes into the building and it has its own substation,"" Mr Noble said.

Located on Shanley Street, the property footprint has a total site area of 66,960m2, building improvements of 15,702m2, and a permit approved for further development.

Mike Noble, director at Garry Nash and Co Real Estate, said the property was bought by Bathla in Sydney in March 2022 with plans to build pod bathrooms out of Wangaratta.

The company successfully applied for a permit to construct another 7000m2 building out the front of the existing building.

The company bought up a portfolio of properties after Covid, however, when the building industry was impacted by the tough economy it decided to put multiple properties on the market, including Wangaratta.

""They got in there and tied up the building and carried out a lot of cosmetic improvements to parts of it that hadn't been used since Solectron were in there prior to Bruck,"" Mr Noble said.

He said a lot of the activity in regional areas is being driven by the broader regional economies rather than out of Melbourne.

However, when Garry Nash and Co first had it on the market and sold it previously there was a lot of activity from metropolitan occupiers.

""There is three megawatts of power that goes into the building and it has its own substation,"" Mr Noble said.

""It could be appealing to a lot of the occupancies in Melbourne that don't have a decent power supply for manufacturing or other operations.""

From a rental or occupancy cost perspective, regional areas are about half the price of metropolitan areas.

""Rent for the Shanley Street site would be around $80-$100 a square metre but it would be double that in Melbourne,"" Mr Noble said.

""Land tax is cheaper and there is still the 50 per cent stamp duty concession for commercial, industrial and extractive industry sales regionally and on this property it could equate to $200,000.""

To rebuild the property, Mr Noble said the cost would be about $30m and the owners would like $15m to basically cover their acquisition costs and what they've put into it.

He noted that it would be a challenge for an investor to buy it and secure tenants as there are almost 16,000m2 under roof, however if the operator had a purpose to use most of it, there is greater potential to lease out the remainder.

If an already operating business views the property as fit for purpose it would be ideal as Mr Noble said land is at a premium and even if you had the land you couldn't build what's there.

A RICH MANUFACTURING PAST

The building originated when IBM arrived in Wangaratta in 1976 with the intention of manufacturing electric typewriters and the facilities at the Shanley Street site were constructed in 1978-79 where the manufacture of personal computers began in 1983.

At the time it was only the third plant in the world to produce IBM PCs.

IBM sold the facility to Australia's privately held Bluegum Technology in November 1997, with the Wangaratta workforce continuing to manufacture computers under contract from IBM, followed in 1998 by a $250m contract from Alcatel.

In June 2000 however, the high-tech manufacturing plant passed into foreign hands, acquired by the US-listed electronics giant, Solectron Corporation.

In a devastating blow to the city, Solectron closed the manufacturing plant in 2001, resulting in the loss of 220 local jobs.

Bruck Group acquired the facilities some years later to use as an Australian base for Wilson Fabrics, prior to selling the site to its current owners in 2022.",https://images.wangarattachronicle.com.au/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1odz7l5ecxm5hmxya4p/0/shanleystbuildingsale_image001_58603-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2,N,,2026-01-11 14:14:20.017936

The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation's annual convention in New York. The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.

Google's new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers' inventory.

In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam's Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.

OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart's website except for fresh food.

Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.

Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.

San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.

The new experience — built by Walmart and accessible directly within Gemini using the Universal Commerce Protocol — addresses several key customer needs:

Great items, at great prices: Gemini will automatically include Walmart and Sam's Club in-store and online products when it's relevant. For example, when a customer asks for advice on camping equipment for the spring season, it will return items from the retailer's large inventory of products. And since people talk back-and-forth with Gemini, there are more opportunities to show relevant products and services throughout the conversation.

Personalization and familiarity: When customers discover items in Gemini, Walmart helps them move from inspiration to purchase in a seamless, trusted experience — all within the familiar Walmart and Sam's environments they know and love. When customers link their accounts, Walmart will recommend complementary items based on their past online and in-store purchases, combine their order with other items they've put in their Walmart or Sam's Club carts, and provide all the benefits of their Walmart+ and Sam's Club memberships.

Fast delivery: Customers and members can get in-store and club items delivered right where and when they want it, with hundreds of thousands of locally curated products delivered in under three hours and as fast as 30 minutes.

Born in Cranston, she was the beloved daughter of the late Vincenzo and Teresa (Fusco) Soscia, she was predeceased by her husband of 70 years, Arthur C. Micallef. Rosalie was the devoted mother of Arthur A. Micallef and his wife Beverly, Gregory E. Micallef, and Susan Micallef- Burke, and the proud matriarch of 5 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren. The youngest of 9 children, “PeeWee” grew up in a home filled with love and commotion, a much simpler era, in the heart of then rural Knightsville, with deeply rooted traditions. One in particular, the Feast of the Madonna Della Civita, was always, and remains still, an integral part of our family heritage. As an outstanding student at Cranston High School, she was nominated for two “superlatives”. Regulations allowed acceptance of only one, Rosalie chose “most athletic” over “most popular”. During World War II, as part of “the greatest generation”, while her husband flew in combat missions over Europe, Rosalie worked at the Fields Point Shipyard in Providence, now the site of Johnson & Wales Culinary Campus. As avid golfers, she and Arthur were founding members of the original Alpine Club, from its humble beginnings as a Social Club on Oaklawn Avenue in Cranston, now the location of the Immaculate Conception Church, to the elaborate Golf/ Country Club that it is today. With Rosalie’s inherent homemaking skills, the Micallef household was home to endless festivities from traditional Christmas and Family Sunday dinners to boisterous New Year’s parties- favored by Rosie and Art’s closest friends for “best food/ most fun”. In her late fifties, Rosalie decided to go to college and graduated from URI in 1981 with a degree in Communications. She utilized her education to advocate for everyday citizens while with the RI Attorney General’s Consumer Unit Division. Also, over many years, she and her husband traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. They enabled their entire family to enjoy “Italy with Gerard”, and over 30 summers of fun at Bonnett Shores Beach Club. Truly special were year-round getaways to their White Mountains New Hampshire home, which they generously opened up to family, friends, and neighbors. Lastly, and befittingly, Rosalie achieved her final goal: to pass peacefully in her home of over 80 years. So, here’s to “a life well lived”! We raise a glass to Rosie – a very dry martini. Salute! The Micallef family wishes to acknowledge, with great appreciation, the exceptional personal care Rosalie received especially from Victoria, her truly dearest friend and primary care giver for over 11 years, and also the more recent assistance from “angels” Carrie, Verna, Quella, and Amanda.

The idea of the US decoupling from China is flawed, the CEO of American tech giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has said, highlighting that the economic and technological ties binding Beijing and Washington remain far deeper than widely perceived.

The comment comes as the world’s two largest economies remain locked in a series of mutual accusations. Washington has repeatedly accused China of unfair practices such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer, while Beijing condemns US export controls as politicizing trade and warns that they disrupt global supply chains and harm all involved.

“The idea that floated around about US decoupling from China, I think, is flawed, and our dependency on each other is quite significant and it’s deeper than people think,” Huang said in a video interview with Time released earlier this week.

The executive also highlighted the global dependence of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector on “the brilliant students and the brilliant scientists of China.” Huang added that 50% of the world’s AI researchers are from the country or have Chinese roots.

The US Department of Commerce in September placed 32 foreign entities, including 23 Chinese firms, on its trade blacklist. Among them were two companies accused of using US equipment to help manufacture chips for SMIC, China’s top chipmaker.

The blacklisted companies were accused of what Washington sees as undermining fair trade practices and its national security interests. Beijing strongly opposed the move, calling the sanctions an abuse of export controls, and soon after launched anti-dumping and anti-discrimination investigations into US chip policies.

US export controls on advanced AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200, a China-specific AI chip, had been implemented under national security rules for years, effectively restricting shipments to China. In December 2025, US President Donald Trump reversed part of the previous ban and allowed exports of H200, a China-specific AI chip, to “approved” Chinese customers under a regulated licensing regime with a 25% fee to the US government.

Despite US approval, Chinese regulators initially paused or limited orders, citing the necessity to access rules and balance AI demand with support for domestic chip development. Earlier this month, media reports indicated that China is moving toward authorizing H200 imports, potentially with conditions restricting usage and domestic procurement.

An instant checkout function will allow customers to make purchases from some businesses and through a range of payment providers without leaving the Gemini chat they used to find products, according to Walmart and Google.

The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation’s annual convention in New York. The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.

“The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,” John Furner, Walmart’s incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.

Google’s new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers’ inventory.

In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam’s Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.

OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food.

Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer’s website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.

Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.

San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.

Google said the AI-assisted shopping features in Gemini only would be available to U.S. users initially but that it planned to expand internationally in the coming months.

Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.
The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes.
But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.","Wing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year.

The two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch.

The expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.

The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.

The announcement places the former Google X project firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.

The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.

Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.

Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It’s an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business.

“And so that is what I’m here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ywvle5Kwp1vgvDo3XvqfLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/0969698a0cfb05dcbb640eb64ebd0ed6,N,,2026-01-11 14:59:36.719771

The huge project is expected to cost a whopping $5 billion and will take years to complete.

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has completed a new use and land agreement (ULA) with its airlines, finalizing how they will be impacted by the expansion.

The major airport is set to almost double its capacity with 32 gates being added to the site that currently has 34.

Initial plans stated an increase by 20 gates which was then renegotiated.

To cater for the arrival, a major new concourse will be constructed.

Concourse B will host 26 of the new gates and will oversee domestic flights only.

The original concourse will be for international and domestic flights, according to Aviation Week.

Meanwhile, the six other new gates will be part of a small, standalone terminal – Concourse M.

“Concourse M will support construction phasing, accommodate new airline entrants and provide operational flexibility for irregular operations, including off-schedule and diverted flights,” airport execs said.

Under the finalized ULA with airlines, carriers will be assigned the new gates gradually over the next decade.

Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the airport’s leading carriers, are expected to benefit the most from the expansion.

They will control half of the airport’s total gates once the project is complete.

Other signatories of the ULA include United, American and Alaska Airlines, all of which have agreed to continue operations at the airport for at least the next ten years.

The entire project is expected to be completed by the early 2030s.

As well as the new gates, it also includes the construction of a tunnel connecting the concourses, taxiways, and upgrades to the existing concourse.

The ULA “reflects years of partnership, thoughtful negotiations and shared vision with our airline partners,” the airport’s CEO Ghizlane Badawi said.

“The program, and all associated projects, are funded through traditional airport development funding sources, such as airport cash reserves, current and future airport revenues, future revenue bond proceeds and FAA grants,” said airport execs.

“No local Austin taxpayer dollars are used to fund the airport’s expansion program.”",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/newspress-collage-qdu3lft9j-1767947907842.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1767929928&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2026-01-11 13:59:34.063321

Additionally, Delta passengers faced numerous setbacks at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. The disruptions left some Delta passengers stranded for days.

Right here on The Travel, affected users commented on disruptions faced at AMS.

One person wrote, ""I was one of those stuck in ATL. My layover was 14 hours!""

Another person commented, ""My daughter was stranded at Shiphol airport from Saturday to Tuesday. After 3 days of canceled flights Delta refunded her fare and told her there were no flights to rebook her on. Trains were also cancelled due to frozen switches. She had to uber to the port and take a 17-hr ferry to the UK. She had to book a new ticket from Heathrow. This has been unprecedented!""

Passengers fear these disruptions may only continue.

KLM has issued a statement in recent days regarding the fiasco that caused hundreds of flight cancellations.

Here's a closer look at KLM's statement, and how passengers are reacting.

KLM Apologized For The Recent Flight Disruptions At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol

Minister Robert Tieman is calling for a review of the flight disruptions at Schiphol Airport at the start of the year. Severe winter weather disrupted flights across the country. Issues persisted due to de-icing issues caused by KLM at the airport.

​​​​​​​

Marjan Rintel, KLM CEO, addressed the issue, stating that more needs to be done to inform travelers in the future if such disruptions take place.

“I understand that frustration. What we’re seeing is that people at Schiphol also need much more information than what’s in the app, what you get in email, or what you can find on your phone.”

Rintel added, “The problem, of course, is when you have to rebook 300,000 people and 70 percent of your flights are canceled because there is no capacity at the airport to fly, it’s very difficult to say: you’re going tomorrow, because tomorrow your flight might be canceled again. But what we’ve seen is that if you can’t provide that information, you still have to be there for all your passengers, to help them.”

Issues have persisted at AMS, with 245 flight departures delayed on Saturday, according to FlightAware. The delays affected 43% of departing flights from AMS.

Passengers in the United States are concerned that these issues may persist and that prominent carriers to the airport, such as Delta, may experience further setbacks.

The biggest issue for many passengers is that Delta may be powerless in these situations, while KLM has significant control over Delta flights.

Delta Air Lines' Passengers Fear That The Carrier Is Powerless Over Ongoing Disruptions At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol

Delta has seen many setbacks at Schiphol Airport this month.

​​​​​​​Among them includes restrictions on Delta Cargo products.

The cargo restrictions were in place until January 11.

Delta said in a statement, ”The restriction timeframe has been extended and is expected to remain in place through 11 January. This timeframe is subject to change based on operational conditions. “Delta Cargo will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as new information becomes available.”

Along with the cargo restrictions, Delta passengers experienced several setbacks in Amsterdam.

​​​​​​​One passenger reported that delays lasted up to 36 hours before finally finding another flight home.

""The real issue is/was the de-icing process. It takes hours for planes to get a slot in one of the 4 de-icing stations. This caused the pilots on two of the flights that I was on, to timeout and the flights to be cancelled. That happens on Sunday 4-th and Monday 5th. Yesterday I got another flight for the 6th. At 11 PM that flight gets cancelled.""

""So on the phone with Delta I see availability on the premium and delta one cabins which the agent denied to put me in. They give me a flight for the 7th, more then 36 hours,"" a stranded Delta passenger wrote a few days ago.

Other Delta passengers are alarmed by the disruptions, given that the carrier has minimal control and the international hub.

One person wrote, ""KLM handles everything for Delta in AMS. It's not the smoothest arrangement.""

Another user added, ""Everything happening at AMS right now is completely crazy and I think there’s little Delta can do. They rely on KLM for the ground operations there, and KLM is a mess.""

It remains to be seen what the rest of the month will look like, but for now, passengers are eager to see changes made at AMS.

Delta Air Lines Had The Most Flight Delays On Saturday

On Saturday, Delta Air Lines had the most delays, with 791. The carrier also had 12 cancelled flights.

According to FlightAware, there were 4,657 delays within, into or out of the United States on Saturday, along with 70 cancellations.

As for the other major U.S. airlines, American Airlines had 561 delays, while United had 419, impacting 16% of its flights.

On Sunday morning, Delta Air Lines had 76 delays and three cancelled flights.

The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.

With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with ""Instant Checkout,"" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.

Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" Furner said in a news release. ""We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.""

Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, described the deal with Google's Gemini as ""another step toward creating seamless shopping experiences for customers and members that are more intuitive and personal than ever before.""

Pichai said in the release that Google is excited to work with Walmart ""on a new open standard to make agentic commerce a reality.""

For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start on an AI chatbot instead of its own app or website — is changing the retailer's digital strategy.

""Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,"" he said.

Walmart leaders have also been vocal about the ways that AI will change the workforce and the roles of its employees, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.

Le groupe français, qui détient actuellement 19,8% du capital de Banco BPM, a déposé une demande d'autorisation l'an passé en vue d'acquérir, selon son communiqué, un nombre d'actions suffisant pour situer sa participation dans la banque italienne ""immédiatement au-dessus du seuil de 20%"".

Selon l'agence de presse italienne Ansa, les conditions fixées par la BCE concerneront la gouvernance, le groupe français devant limiter à sept le nombre de ses représentants au sein du conseil d'administration de Banco BPM afin d'éviter une ""prise de contrôle de fait"" et d'éviter les conflits d'intérêts.

Selon des informations d'Il Messaggero parues en septembre et confirmées à Reuters par plusieurs sources, Crédit Agricole examine avec Deutsche Bank et Rothschild une possible fusion de sa branche italienne avec Banco BPM, qui envisage quant à elle plusieurs options après l'échec de son rachat par Unicredit.

Une fois obtenu le feu vert de la BCE, Crédit agricole compte monter en deux étapes au capital de Banco BPM, à 24,9% puis 29,9%, rapporte le Corriere della Sera, selon qui ces opérations seraient achevées en avril, date à laquelle l'établissement italien doit approuver ses résultats 2025 et renouveler son conseil d'administration.

Between the lines, that final drive felt like ""do or die"" for the defense, in the words of veteran Grady Jarrett.
The it Odunze referred to is the largest postseason comeback in franchise history, the Bears' first playoff win since 2010, first postseason win over Green Bay since 1941, and most importantly for this Bears team, a culture-defining moment.
In the Bears' locker room after the game, there was a variety of opinions on the momentum-swinging play.
Santos' third and final field goal cut the deficit to 21-9 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter.","As the seemingly never-ending, 11-play Packers drive unfolded, other members of the Bears offense remained near the benches with coaches, attempting to remain focused in case they had to take the field once again. But with the future of their magical season in limbo, focusing on anything but those final plays felt impossible.

""I was like, 'Man, let's just win this game, defense, let's go do our thing,"" receiver Rome Odunze said. ""We were trying to go over some plays on the sideline, and I was half looking, half like, I'm trying to watch this game. I turned into a fan at that point.""

Between the lines, that final drive felt like ""do or die"" for the defense, in the words of veteran Grady Jarrett. For Montez Sweat, the opportunity to secure the incredible victory was invigorating.

""We understood what was at stake,"" Sweat said. ""We just had to end the game.""

While the Packers offense reached the Chicago 23-yard line, pressure from Sweat, Gervon Dexter Sr. and the relentless noise of the home crowd closed in on Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love in the final 20 seconds of regulation. On the final play of the game, the chaos culminated in a fumbled snap and a last-ditch pass attempt that fell incomplete off the hands of nickel back Kyler Gordon. With zeros on the clock, a flood of navy swarmed the field as Soldier Field shook.

""I ran onto the field and just felt relief,"" Odunze said. ""Like, 'Wow, we really did it.' Definitely a win that will go down in history, and we're not done.""

The it Odunze referred to is the largest postseason comeback in franchise history, the Bears' first playoff win since 2010, first postseason win over Green Bay since 1941, and most importantly for this Bears team, a culture-defining moment.

""It felt great to have my first playoff win with these guys,"" Williams said. ""It felt great being able to fight the way we did and come out victorious.""

The Bears' wild card win wasn't the result of one specific play or player, but rather the team regrouping at halftime while trailing 21-3 and committing to clawing back, one snap at a time. In the Bears' locker room after the game, there was a variety of opinions on the momentum-swinging play.

For safety Kevin Byard III, the game-changing moment actually happened in the locker room at halftime, courtesy of coach Ben Johnson.

""Ben was just talking to the group, talking about, 'Hey, we've got 30 minutes. Let's make this the most memorable game in Chicago Bears history.'

""We all know we're a resilient team. There's no quit in this team. The league knows that the Chicago Bears are gonna play 60 minutes no matter what the scenario is, no matter what the score is.""

Linebacker D'Marco Jackson, who took over play-calling responsibilities after T.J. Edwards left the game with an injury in the second quarter, pointed to the opening drive of the second half.

""That quick three-and-out, it set the tone,"" Jackson said. ""I feel like the atmosphere rose up and the offense fed off that and special teams too, just making plays. It was really just complementary football for everyone.""

Receiver Olamide Zaccheaus believes the game shifted with that possession as well as the 37-yard punt return by Devin Duvernay just before the end of the third quarter.

""Honestly, the energy specifically that the defense brought in the second half,"" Zaccheaus said, ""they went three-and-out on the first drive. The defense sparked it off for us. Them coming out with that energy, getting a stop early. And then we had the big returns by Duv, too. Those were big plays just to create momentum for us.""

Duvernay's return allowed the Bears to start their first drive of the fourth quarter in Green Bay territory, which ultimately led to a 51-yard field goal by kicker Cairo Santos, who, at that point, was responsible for all nine Bears points.

""Even though it didn't seem like field goals were going to help early in the second half, it's chipping away with those three points,"" Santos said. ""We always talk about every point matters. I take pride in executing and putting points on the board when our unit is called because we just know it's going to be important at the end of the game.

""We execute from the first kick to the last like we depend on it.""

Santos' third and final field goal cut the deficit to 21-9 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter. For the veteran kicker, seeing the scoreboard reset to ""15:00"" for the final time was the only momentum-changing moment that he needed to see.

""When we shift into the fourth quarter, that's always a momentum shift for this team,"" Santos said. ""When it's time to have everyone's best, the game clock turns into the fourth quarter, that's when the fire ignites in all of us. Would love to start the game better as a team, but if that's what it takes, we'll be there every game.""

Right tackle Darnell Wright identified three plays on the next Bears possession, which followed another three-and-out by the Packers, that changed the course of the game. First, the 22-yard and 21-yard receptions by Loveland down the left sideline that moved the Bears to the Packers' 12-yard line, followed by D'Andre Swift's 6-yard touchdown run.

""I'd say the biggest one was probably when Swift scored,"" Wright said. ""I feel like we just needed one, needed one score, six points, get on the board. And then big catches by Colston. Those right there created a little spark we needed. It let us see the end goal.

""When you're down two or three scores, you can't really see how it's going to turn out. But when you close that gap, you can see, 'Okay, one stop, touchdown. One stop, touchdown.'""

The Bears didn't reach the end zone until 10:12 remained in the game, but by that point, the tide had already turned. While they trailed 21-16, the scoreboard didn't matter. The home sideline had absorbed all the momentum and sustained it by using the crowd's energy to their advantage. No additional motivational words needed to be exchanged. The assignment was clear.

""I think we just keep giving each other opportunities,"" Santos said. ""Nothing needs to be said. It's just understood that we've got the talent, the coaching to put us in position to execute what we need to do to win the game. It's just understood.""

Not to be downplayed is Williams proceeding to lead back-to-back touchdown drives to put the Bears on top, despite the momentum shift having already been completed. First came an 8-yard dart to Zaccheaus and a subsequent two-point pass to Loveland, capping off a quick 10-play, 76-yard scoring drive. Then, following a missed field goal by Packers kicker Brandon McManus, Williams took the Bears 66 yards on six plays, ending the go-ahead drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to receiver DJ Moore.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/z7abkb4dlculjf4ioclx,N,,2026-01-11 11:59:58.766795

Translated by: Saoirse, Foresight News

Under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are prohibited from paying interest to stablecoin holders.

Currently, Coinbase Exchange is offering users a 3.35% reward for holding USDC on the platform. This is possible because the GENIUS Act only prohibits issuers from offering interest, but does not impose restrictions on distributors.

However, before the U.S. Senate's relevant committee reviewed the ""Crypto Market Structure Act"" on January 15 (aimed at systematizing cryptocurrency regulation), a full-scale debate had already erupted over whether the ""ban on stablecoin interest should be extended to the distribution stage.""

Strong opposition from the banking industry

The American Bankers Association (ABA) is the leading group advocating for a comprehensive ban on interest payments on stablecoins. In an open letter released on January 5, the association argued that the interest payment ban in the GENIUS Act should not apply only to issuers, but should be interpreted broadly and extended to affiliates. They are pushing to have this interpretation explicitly included in the ""Crypto Market Structure Act.""

The Underlying Reasons Behind the Banking Sector's Strong Opposition

The reason the banking industry is so eager to completely ban interest payments on stablecoins is actually very simple:

Concerned about outflow of bank deposits;

A decrease in deposits means a reduction in the ability to lend;

Stablecoins are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Ultimately, stablecoins are threatening the stable and highly profitable business model that has sustained banking for decades.

The Comeback of the Cryptocurrency Industry

In the eyes of the cryptocurrency industry, this move by the banking sector is a major issue. If the restrictions of the GENIUS Act are expanded through the proposed ""Cryptocurrency Market Structure Act"" due to banking sector lobbying, it would effectively rewrite and narrow the scope of the already-passed legislation. As expected, this action has sparked strong opposition from the crypto industry.

Coinbase's Position

Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's Chief Policy Officer, refuted this by citing relevant research indicating that stablecoins have not caused significant outflows from bank deposits. He also added a new argument to the debate by referencing news about the digital yuan offering interest on payments.

Paradigm's Viewpoint

Alexander Grieve, Vice President of Government Affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, offered another perspective. He argued that even if interest were allowed only on stablecoins used for payment purposes, this would effectively amount to an indirect ""holding tax"" on consumers.

How about the situation in China and South Korea?

Although China and South Korea are not as fast as some other Asian countries in advancing policies related to cryptocurrencies, both have recently introduced a series of new initiatives regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoin regulations. The differences in their policies regarding interest payments are particularly noteworthy:

China's central bank has decided to offer interest on digital yuan payments, treating it on par with regular bank deposits, in an effort to promote the adoption of the digital currency.

South Korea's policy direction is closer to that of the United States: it prohibits the issuer from paying interest, but does not explicitly prohibit distributors from doing so.

From a macro perspective, China's aggressive policy stance becomes easier to understand. The digital yuan is not a private stablecoin, but a legal digital currency directly issued by the central bank. Promoting the digital yuan can not only counterbalance the dominant positions of private platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, but also strengthen a financial system centered around the central bank.

Conclusion

New technologies give rise to new industries, and the emergence of these new industries often poses a threat to traditional ones.

Traditional financial institutions, represented by banks, are facing an irreversible trend toward the era of stablecoins. At this pivotal moment, resisting change brings more harm than good; embracing transformation and exploring new opportunities is a wiser choice.

In fact, the stablecoin industry presents significant opportunities even for existing market participants. Many banks have already begun to proactively position themselves:

BNY Mellon in New York, USA, is making moves to position itself in the custody of stablecoin reserves business;

Cross River Bank acts as an intermediary for Circle's USDC fiat on-ramp channel through application programming interfaces (APIs);

JPMorgan is also testing a tokenized deposit business.

Major card organizations also have a vested interest in this matter. As the scale of on-chain payments continues to expand, the business of traditional card organizations may face a decline. However, companies like Visa and Mastercard have not chosen to resist this trend; instead, they actively support stablecoin payment settlements, seeking new opportunities for development in line with the trend.

Asset management institutions are also entering the field. Funds such as BlackRock are actively promoting the tokenization of various investment funds.

If the banking industry's lobbying efforts ultimately succeed and a provision banning stablecoin interest payments is included in the ""Crypto Market Structure Act,"" the cryptocurrency industry will suffer a major setback.

As a professional in the cryptocurrency industry, I can only hope that the ""Crypto Market Structure Act"" will not include provisions that effectively undermine the ""GENIUS Act.""",https://assets.staticimg.com/cms/media/7feiEEHmJE61RECXMyp8rTcA5Qcsl0zSv6rz9NVjg.png,N,,2026-01-11 10:14:10.829928

La saison réinvente cette esthétique de la désinvolture, née sous les traits d’une très jeune Kate Moss immortalisée par la photographe Corinne Day dans les pages de The Face et i-D. Présents sur les sets, le hairstylist Eugene Souleiman et le make-up artist Dick Page avaient alors posé les jalons de la beauté grunge. Ils expliquent comment la réinventer aujourd’hui.

Retour aux racines

Statement anticonsumériste, réponse aux excès de glamour des 80’s, le grunge est une fulgurance de débrouillardise. “À l’époque, on partait en minibus avec Corinne Day et Naomi Campbell, sandwichs à la main, pour The Face. Je portais un petit sac à dos contenant quelques produits et des épingles à cheveux. On devait se montrer ingénieux”, se remémore Eugene Souleiman. Pour l’expert, c’est cet esprit qu’il faut conserver, car le grunge est un anti-style, “mais qui nécessite beaucoup de style pour être réussi”, précise-t-il. Une structure plus souple comme si la coupe avait repoussé naturellement, quelques racines qui rendent un blond plus nonchalant... L’allure doit être undone mais pas forcément anti-glamour.

Si l’entretien de la chevelure (coupe et couleur) s’allège un peu, tout réside dans le styling. La recette secrète du pro? “Mélangez un peu de conditioner sans rinçage à de l’eau et massez la mixture sur les racines. La chevelure gagne en volume et en texture, comme si vous aviez dansé toute la nuit”, dévoile-t-il. Aux plus pressées, le pro recommande le soin texturisant Hair Resort de Kevin Murphy à l’effet similaire.

About a girl

Même consigne côté pigments. Le teint est libre de tout sculpting, la bouche s’assombrit, le regard se délave. Crayons gras et rouges à lèvres s’appliquent sans pinceau et se fondent au doigt. “L’essentiel est d’accepter l’idée que rien ne doit être parfait ou trop travaillé”, insiste Dick Page, pionnier du no make-up make-up. Après des années d’overliner et de lip contour, le lipstick mat n’est jamais plus intéressant qu’après avoir vécu: smudgé, teinté, effet mordu... “Vous pouvez aussi carrément le remplacer par un crayon rouge brun, que vous glisserez dans votre poche et que vous appliquerez on the go sans miroir”, encourage le make-up artist, qui obtient des teintes parfaites en assourdissant ses rouges à lèvres d’un peu de crayon noir pour les yeux. “J’en ai un de L’Oréal Paris, un coup de cœur, qui est discontinué et que je trouve sur eBay.",https://www.harpersbazaar.fr/imgre/fit/~1~hbz~2026~01~08~a0cf75b1-8d04-45ad-86b8-96ca2a409ef0.jpg/1200x630/focus-point/441%2C580/when-i-wake-up-in-my-makeup-le-retour-du-grunge.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 11:03:26.408541

Last Week: Ottawa Charge 4, Vancouver Goldeneyes 2 The Charge looked fantastic in the first period.
The game had barely started when the Charge found themselves on the penalty kill.
The Charge got the first goal of the game - a tap-in by Savolainen off a great rush to the net.
The Week Ahead The Charge play their next game today at noon, and we'll have a full preview going up shortly, so I won't repeat things here.","We're so back.

Another week with just one game for the Charge, and oh boy was it a fun one! Ottawa just keeps on racking up wins despite their very poor start to the season.

The winning streak has been so good, in fact, that the Charge are now fifth in the league, tied with the Toronto Sceptres in points. A regulation win today would have them jump all the way up to third. I love the three point system.

Last Week: Ottawa Charge 4, Vancouver Goldeneyes 2

The Charge looked fantastic in the first period. They did a much better job of getting to the net than they usually do, and made shockingly few defensive mistakes.

The game had barely started when the Charge found themselves on the penalty kill. Thankfully, they killed it off without any problems and soon looked very much like the better team.

There was a scary moment early on where Kadirova threw a high hit on Abby Boreen, and Boreen was lying on the ice for a while. Thankfully, it looked like she just got the wind knocked out of her, and didn't miss a shift. That's not the first time Kadirova has thrown a dangerous hit, unfortunately. It feels like she's been having trouble adjusting to the physicality of the league all season, and after getting hit a few times early in the season it almost feels like she's overcorrected and is now throwing dangerous hits of her own. Hopefully she can figure things out soon.

The Charge got the first goal of the game - a tap-in by Savolainen off a great rush to the net.

That would do it for the first period. Ottawa looked like the better team but only had a 1 goal lead.

The second was still pretty good, but the game did start to look a bit more even. Kadirova had an absolutely ridiculous shift in the second period where she almost scored multiple times, but other than that the team didn't look particularly dangerous.

The Goldeneyes got another powerplay toward the end of the second, and it was absolutely wild. Manon McMahon almost got a shorthanded goal, and then Philips pulled off some unbelievable saves to keep the Goldeneyes off the scoresheet.

That ended up being a bit of a turning point. Vancouver really picked up the pace late in the second, but of course Philips turned them away.

There was another injury right at the end of the second, when Karvinen took a shot to the chest and was slow to get up. Thankfully she was also fine. We're getting close enough to the Olympics now that I'm sure fans of the national teams are worried about injuries, so I'm sure team Finland is glad she's alright.

The Charge got a powerplay right at the end of the second period that carried over into the third, but they didn't score on it despite some good pressure around the net.

It took about five minutes for Anna Meixner to bury a rebound to double Ottawa's lead. This is what happens when you actually get to the net.

Of course, the Goldeneyes couldn't make it easy on us. About halfway through the second period, Sophie Jaques, who should have been a Charge for life (yes I'm still hung up on the decision to pass her over in the inaugural draft), beat Philips to break the shutout and pull her team within one.

Things got weird at the very end of the game. First, Vancouver pulled their goaltender, obviously, but Brianne Jenner scored an empty netter to put the Charge up 3-1 with about a minute and a half left in the game (she had an opportunity to do a slap shot but unfortunately didn't take it). Then, pretty much as soon as the puck dropped again, Karvinen scored for Vancouver, so the Goldeneyes were back within one with just over a minute left. Finally, Rebecca Leslie scored for the Charge with the net empty, so we were back to leading by two, and the 4-2 score held.

Watching a team pull their goaltender in a one-goal game only to end up giving up two empty net goals gave me flashbacks to the DJ Smith era Sens. It's nice to be on the other end of one of those games.

Notable Performances

Savolainen had a fantastic game, especially offensively. It felt like she had the puck every time she was on the ice. Definitely her best game of the season, and that's saying something.

I really liked what I saw from Wozniewicz too. She was causing problems in the offensive zone all night.

Of course, I also need to mention Payton Hemp, who had two assists.

The Week Ahead

The Charge play their next game today at noon, and we'll have a full preview going up shortly, so I won't repeat things here.

After that, they head to Laval on Tuesday to take on la Victoire de Montréal. As someone who has attended every single game these two teams have played in Montreal, I can tell you right now that the Charge don't usually win these ones. Let's all hope they can turn things around, for my sanity if for no other reason.

The Victoire actually haven't been playing particularly well recently, with their top line being the main thing keeping them afloat. They're actually two points below the Charge in the standings, but they have two games in hand so it doesn't mean that much.

That one will be an Amazon Prime broadcast, with puck drop at 7pm EST.

ID7,Best Buy,2026-01-11 11:49:23+00:00,Yahoo Finance,AI is no 'business killer': Why Wall Street is buying software stocks in 2026 - Yahoo Finance,Francisco Velasquez,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-is-no-business-killer-why-wall-street-is-buying-software-stocks-in-2026-150016555.html,"Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a research note, observing the industry is now in its third year of the AI shift.
The biggest impact on the software industry thus far has been ""narrative and scared customers unwilling to commit,"" he added.
Luria's pick for 2026 is Commvault (CVLT), where he sees a massive 50%+ upside and a $220 price target driven by sustained momentum and a rebound in margins.
The business is a ""subscription acceleration story"" with an ROIC north of 100% and price target of $250.
He highlights ServiceNow (NOW), with a price target of $781, as a giant in the early stages of this transition; JFrog (FROG), in a mid-transition, with a price target of $65; and Snowflake (SNOW) as the gold standard for the fully consumption-driven model, with a price target of $220.","The death of software has been greatly exaggerated.

""If AI is going to kill a business, the signs would already be there,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a research note, observing the industry is now in its third year of the AI shift.

The biggest impact on the software industry thus far has been ""narrative and scared customers unwilling to commit,"" he added. The latter may be a factor that's starting to change, as companies come to realize ""neither they nor their software vendors have been run over"" by AI.

As this ""scared"" money returns to the market, analysts from DA Davidson, Piper Sandler, and Truist Securities identified names likely to lead the recovery. A common thread runs throughout the trio's picks: These companies provide the infrastructure upon which AI is built.

D.A. Davidson's top picks focus on specialized growth and infrastructure resilience. Luria's pick for 2026 is Commvault (CVLT), where he sees a massive 50%+ upside and a $220 price target driven by sustained momentum and a rebound in margins.

Other stocks to watch include Manhattan Associates (MANH), a supply chain and retail software company. The business is a ""subscription acceleration story"" with an ROIC north of 100% and price target of $250. Up next is marketing platform Zeta Global (ZETA), which is benefitting from the ""replacement of legacy marketing tech"" and carries a $29 target.

Rounding out the list are Box (BOX), which is gaining ground via ""Enterprise Advanced"" upgrades with a $45 target, and Datadog (DDOG), labeled the ""complete Observability platform"" for complex AI-driven environments with a $225 price target.

Parallel to Luria's list, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish is looking toward the ""Gen Z"" winners and infrastructure plays. Fish highlights Rubrik (RBRK) with a $75 price target for its completed SaaS transition; Nutanix (NTNX), priced at $50, as it gains share from VMware; and Axon (AXON), with a $563 price target, for its recurring model in public safety and drone integration.

Meanwhile, Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman writes that software skepticism often centers on ""seat and license-based pricing"" — the idea that if AI makes humans more efficient, companies will buy fewer software licenses. However, he argues that the industry is simply evolving, as the rise of agentic AI — autonomous bots performing tasks 24/7 — encourages a shift toward consumption-based pricing.

""As workflows move from human-initiated tasks to autonomous agents executing at scale, billing tied to usage becomes the most logical way to capture value,"" Tillman wrote, citing examples such as compute, data processing, and transactions. Unlike humans, AI agents don't sleep, meaning billable events can compound around the clock.

That shift favors vendors that can demonstrate daily ROI, invest heavily in R&D to expand use cases, and build transparent metering and governance tools, per Tillman.

He highlights ServiceNow (NOW), with a price target of $781, as a giant in the early stages of this transition; JFrog (FROG), in a mid-transition, with a price target of $65; and Snowflake (SNOW) as the gold standard for the fully consumption-driven model, with a price target of $220.

These companies are betting that as AI adoption ramps up, the volume of data processed and transactions executed will more than offset any decline in human seats.

In 2026, Wall Street isn't buying software because the hype is back in vogue; they're buying because the valuations are finally rational, customers are less paralyzed, and the ""business killers"" have yet to show up at the gate.

One of the main reasons Brooklyn has performed better than expected this season and its young players have looked more mature than their ages is due to the presence of the oldest player on the roster, Terance Mann.

Mann would have been the ninth-oldest player on the Clippers roster to put in perspective how young this team is and how young Mann is while being considered the primary veteran.
""I think he's learning how to be a young old man,"" Fernandez said after the loss to the Clippers.","A cardiac monitor measures a person's electrical activity in the heart and displays it as a waveform. Flatlining often spells the worst, while a jagged line signifies being alive.

In the world of the NBA, where the stakes aren't life or death, this illustration takes on a different meaning. If the Brooklyn Nets were hooked up to one of these monitors, they would most likely see the jagged line, showing signs of life and growth.

This season has had more peaks than expected thus far for the Nets, and while some fans may be disgruntled by the franchise's current ""no man's land"" positioning in the league standings, it's the proper way to tank. The youth are being developed, and they are being instilled with a competitive identity rather than one that focuses on a future draft pick.

One of the main reasons Brooklyn has performed better than expected this season and its young players have looked more mature than their ages is due to the presence of the oldest player on the roster, Terance Mann.

The Nets' most recent matchup was a 121-105 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, moving them to 11-24 in this campaign. Mann would have been the ninth-oldest player on the Clippers roster to put in perspective how young this team is and how young Mann is while being considered the primary veteran.

He is on the young side of 29 years old, and yet he has elevated the youngest team in the NBA in his eighth season in the league. Mann's veteran presence has mixed well with both players and coaches –– head coach Jordi Fernandez has noticed his skills.

""I think he's learning how to be a young old man,"" Fernandez said after the loss to the Clippers. ""We've put him in situations to be the vet, you know, in his late 20s, which is sometimes not extremely fair.""

Mann probably didn't expect so much of his role with Brooklyn to be centered around mentorship and leadership. He called his own number in the offseason, signaling for a breakout season, but he hasn't been in the most convenient situations to do so.

Oftentimes, when players get thrown into a vocal leadership role like Mann has been, it takes them time to adapt, but he's quickly adjusted to a new environment and found his way to help the team.

What is in the News

U.S. FDA clearance for the Hugo robotic assisted surgery system for urologic procedures, giving surgeons a modular, multi arm platform integrated with the Touch Surgery digital ecosystem and aimed at high volume operations such as prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy.

Broad U.S. commercial launch of the MiniMed 780G system using Abbott Instinct sensors, offering up to 15 day wear and automated insulin adjustments every five minutes as part of the Medtronic diabetes technology ecosystem.

Real world Diabetes Care analysis on MiniMed 780G, where users with recommended optimal settings recorded 76.3% time in range on missed bolus days, and more than 61% met three American Diabetes Association glycemic targets compared with 36.6% for other settings, based on Medtronic data.

Updated company guidance outlining approximately 5.5% revenue growth and EPS of US$5.62 to US$5.66 for 2026, expectations for 5.5% revenue growth and EPS of US$1.32 to US$1.34 in Q3 2026, and continued spending priorities. The guidance also notes the completion of a long running buyback program first announced in 2017, with 154,605,008 shares repurchased for US$14.3b, including 3,300,161 shares for US$308.7m between July 26 and October 24, 2025.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Medtronic

The fair value estimate is now US$111.05 per share, up slightly from about US$110.97, reflecting a very small upward tweak in the model.

The discount rate is now 8.78%, described as edging slightly lower from 8.78%, signaling a minimal adjustment in the required return used in the analysis.

Revenue growth is now 5.73%, trimmed slightly from 5.79% in the updated assumptions, which modestly reins in the top-line outlook in the model.

The net profit margin is now 15.73%, slightly higher than 15.71%, implying a marginally more optimistic view on profitability in future years.

The future P/E is now 28.31x, nudging slightly above the prior 28.29x assumption used in the comparative work, suggesting a very small shift in how the shares are being benchmarked against peers.

For millions living with diabetes, the biggest constraint isn’t just blood sugar levels. It’s hardware. Traditional insulin pumps tether users to tubes, bulky devices, and workflows that feel more like medical procedure than everyday life. Insulet, through its Omnipod platform, is trying to turn that paradigm on its head by making insulin delivery as invisible and automated as possible.

Instead of a belt clip and plastic tubing, Insulet offers a discreet, wearable insulin ""pod"" that sticks to the skin and talks wirelessly to a controller or smartphone. In an era where GLP-1 drugs are grabbing headlines and big tech is flirting with health hardware, Insulet is quietly building one of the most defensible ecosystems in diabetes technology: a patch-based, tubeless alternative to conventional pumps that has already pulled hundreds of thousands of patients away from syringes and tubes.

Insulet is not just another medtech supplier; it is a pure play on the future of automated insulin delivery and connected care. As payers and regulators push for better outcomes at lower cost, the company’s flagship Omnipod platform is becoming a strategic node linking patients, endocrinologists, and data-driven care models.

Get all details on Insulet here

Inside the Flagship: Insulet

When people say ""Insulet"" in the diabetes world, they almost always mean the company’s flagship product line: the Omnipod family of tubeless insulin pumps, today led by Omnipod 5. This is a wearable, patch-like pump designed for people with type 1 diabetes and some with insulin-requiring type 2. The core idea is simple but powerful: eliminate tubing, automate as much dosing as possible, and integrate tightly with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

The Omnipod system has three key components:

1. The Pod: A small, disposable, waterproof pod worn on the body for up to 72 hours. It holds insulin and houses a tiny cannula that automatically inserts under the skin when activated. There is no dangling tubing. Users can wear pods on the arm, abdomen, thigh, or lower back, making it easier to dress, exercise, and sleep without constantly negotiating around hardware.

2. The Brain (Controller or App): Earlier generations used a dedicated handheld Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). With Omnipod 5, Insulet moves further into app-driven control. The system can be managed using a compatible smartphone or Insulet-supplied controller, allowing dose adjustments, bolus delivery, and system monitoring directly from a familiar interface. That shift not only modernizes the experience but embeds Omnipod into the broader mobile health ecosystem.

3. Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) Algorithm: The most transformative layer is software. Omnipod 5 connects to the Dexcom G6 and now G7 CGM systems (in approved markets) and uses a predictive algorithm to modulate basal insulin delivery automatically. Every five minutes, the system looks at current glucose, trend data, and the user’s personalized targets to increase, decrease, or suspend insulin. The goal: flatten the highs and prevent the dangerous lows, with minimal user micromanagement.

This combination of disposable pod, connected controller, and adaptive algorithm gives Insulet a unique proposition. The company has positioned Omnipod 5 as the first and, for now, leading tubeless, fully integrated AID system commercialized at scale. For parents managing type 1 diabetes in children, that means fewer nighttime alarms and more time in range. For adults juggling work, exercise, and diet, it turns the pump from a visible medical device into a nearly invisible companion.

Insulet’s roadmap is also increasingly platform-centric. The company is building deeper integration with CGM partners like Dexcom, exploring more smartphone-native control, and pushing cloud connectivity to feed clinicians and care teams with granular, real-world data. As virtual clinics and remote endocrinology scale up, Omnipod’s always-on, always-connected profile becomes part of an emerging standard of care.

Market Rivals: Insulet Aktie vs. The Competition

In insulin delivery, Insulet competes primarily against two dominant categories: traditional tubed insulin pumps and multiple daily injections (MDI) augmented by smart pens or connected caps. On the pump side, the two most relevant rivals are Medtronic and Tandem Diabetes Care.

Medtronic MiniMed 780G: Medtronic’s MiniMed 780G is a traditional, tubed insulin pump integrated with the company’s Guardian 4 CGM. Like Omnipod 5, it offers closed-loop or ""advanced hybrid closed-loop"" functionality: an algorithm automatically adjusts basal insulin and can give automatic correction boluses. The 780G’s strengths are depth of algorithm experience, strong clinical validation, and Medtronic’s longstanding presence in hospital and endocrinology networks.

However, compared directly to Omnipod 5, the MiniMed 780G still depends on tubing and a belt- or pocket-worn pump. That introduces friction points: snagging on clothing, discomfort during sleep, and a more visible medical profile. Setup and maintenance can also feel more complex for newly diagnosed users. Medtronic has been working to close the usability gap, but Insulet’s tubeless design remains a differentiated experience that many patients prefer, especially children and active adults.

Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ: Tandem’s t:slim X2 is a sleek, touchscreen insulin pump paired with Dexcom CGMs and powered by its Control-IQ algorithm. Control-IQ dynamically adjusts basal insulin and can deliver automatic correction boluses, competing head-on with Omnipod 5 on time-in-range outcomes. Tandem is strong on user interface design and has built a loyal following through software updates that can be pushed to in-market pumps, extending device life.

Compared directly to Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ, Insulet’s Omnipod 5 trades the polished rechargeable pump hardware for disposable pods that are entirely off-body except for the adhesive site. That shift changes everything from wardrobe choices to exercise routines. While some users appreciate having a reusable, durable pump body with Tandem, others see Omnipod’s patch format as freeing them from visible medical hardware.

New Front: MDI and Smart Insulin Delivery

On another flank, Insulet is competing with the accelerating sophistication of MDI plus smart devices. Products like Novo Nordisk’s smart pens and companies offering dose-tracking caps aim to keep patients on injections while layering in data and coaching. These tools are often cheaper and less infrastructure-heavy than a pump, making them attractive to payers and some adults with type 2 diabetes.

But they stop short of what Insulet offers: real closed-loop automation. Smart pens can track and optimize, but they can’t adjust basal insulin every five minutes based on CGM data. For users who need intensive insulin therapy and want fewer manual decisions, the Omnipod model still offers a qualitatively different experience.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Insulet’s edge comes from a combination of hardware design, human-centered UX, and software-driven automation, rather than a single breakthrough component.

Tubeless as a True Lifestyle Feature

The most obvious differentiator is the lack of tubing. For many patients, this isn’t cosmetic; it’s behavioral. A tubeless pod is easier to wear while playing sports, sleeping, showering, or managing small children. It reduces the constant visual reminder of illness. Adoption data and patient communities consistently highlight this as the main reason users move from tubed pumps or injections to Omnipod and then stay.

Disposable Platform, Recurring Revenue

Insulet’s model is built around recurring pod use, not just one-time hardware sales. Each pod is worn for up to 72 hours and then replaced, creating a high-margin consumables stream. That recurring structure incentivizes Insulet to continuously improve algorithms and app experience, because stickiness drives lifetime value. For users, the benefit is always receiving fresh, sealed hardware, lowering maintenance overhead and worry about mechanical wear.

Algorithm and CGM Partnerships

Omnipod 5’s integration with the Dexcom CGM ecosystem gives it instant credibility among clinicians and tech-forward patients. Dexcom is widely regarded as a gold standard in CGM accuracy and reliability. By choosing to partner instead of building everything in-house, Insulet can move faster on software innovation and expand compatibility as new CGM generations roll out.

Expanding Addressable Market

Insulet is not limiting itself to type 1 diabetes. Its platform is increasingly positioned for insulin-requiring type 2 patients and for markets outside North America, especially as reimbursement frameworks for AID systems evolve. As payers see better time-in-range and lower complication rates, the case for funding pod-based systems strengthens, particularly for patients who struggle with regimen adherence on MDI.

Ecosystem Lock-In Without Feeling Trapped

What Insulet is quietly building is an ecosystem where the pod, the app, the CGM partnership, and the cloud analytics reinforce each other. Once a patient is trained, data is flowing to clinicians, and families are monitoring remotely, switching systems becomes painful. The key is that this lock-in is largely experience-driven: users stay because the system works, not because they are technically unable to leave.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Insulet Aktie, trading under ISIN US45784P1012 and ticker PODD on the Nasdaq, is effectively a direct levered bet on the success and expansion of the Omnipod platform.

According to live market data checked across multiple sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Insulet Aktie was recently trading around the low-to-mid USD 190s range per share, with a market capitalization in the mid– to upper–single digit billions of dollars. As of the latest available quote on the research day, Insulet Aktie was changing hands at approximately USD 194–196 per share, with the figure reflecting intraday trading rather than a stale historical reference. Where real-time quotes were briefly unavailable or delayed, the most recent ""Last Close"" was used and explicitly marked by the data providers.

That valuation embeds several expectations: continued Omnipod 5 adoption in the existing type 1 base, expansion into insulin-requiring type 2 populations, geographic growth, and resilience against competition from both pump rivals and GLP-1 therapies that may delay or reduce progression to insulin. Investors have been watching three product-linked metrics particularly closely:

1. Pod Volume Growth: Rising pod shipments directly signal adherence and user growth. Strong pod volume typically translates into recurring revenue visibility and margin leverage, as manufacturing scales and logistics are optimized.

2. Algorithm & CGM Integration Progress: Regulatory approvals and rollouts of new Omnipod 5 features, additional smartphone compatibility, and deeper Dexcom integration tend to act as catalysts. Each software and ecosystem milestone strengthens Insulet’s differentiation versus Medtronic MiniMed 780G and Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ.

3. Reimbursement and Access: Positive reimbursement decisions from public and private payers are crucial, especially as Omnipod pushes further into type 2 diabetes. Better coverage unlocks new cohorts of patients, which in turn supports higher pod volumes and ultimately flows through to Insulet Aktie’s revenue and earnings trajectory.

While macro conditions, GLP-1 enthusiasm, and medtech sector rotations can create volatility in Insulet Aktie’s share price, the underlying story remains tightly tied to product execution. If Omnipod can continue to deliver superior time-in-range, lower hypoglycemia risk, and a meaningfully better user experience than tubed pumps or smart-pen MDI regimens, the company retains a credible path to long-term double-digit revenue growth. In that scenario, Insulet Aktie functions less like a cyclical device stock and more like a platform subscription play anchored in consumables and data.

Ultimately, Insulet’s investment case and its product story are the same narrative told through different lenses. On the user side, it is about fewer needles, fewer alarms, and less visible hardware. On the market side, it is about recurring pods, connected algorithms, and a defensible place at the center of next-generation diabetes care. If the company keeps executing, Omnipod will not just compete in the pump market; it will help redefine what an insulin ""device"" looks like at all.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405005_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 09:58:50.352155

When asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Mr Bessent said, “It could be as soon as next week,” but did not identify which ones.
IMF, World Bank re-engagement Mr Bessent, who controls the dominant US shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.
An IMF spokesperson said the fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined to comment on Mr Bessent’s mention of a meeting next week.
Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, declared that Venezuela “will no longer have to go to Washington” for funding.","– US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Reuters that additional sanctions on Venezuela could be lifted as soon as next week to facilitate oil sales and that he will also meet the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank next week on their re-engagement with Venezuela.

Mr Bessent said in an interview late on Jan 9 that almost US$5 billion (S$6.4 billion) worth of Venezuela’s currently frozen IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) monetary assets could be deployed to help rebuild the country’s economy.

“We’re de-sanctioning the oil that’s going to be sold,” he said during a visit to a Winnebago Industries engineering facility. The Treasury is examining changes that would facilitate the repatriation of sale proceeds from oil stored largely on ships back to Venezuela.

“How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people?” he said of the Treasury’s sanctions analysis.

When asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Mr Bessent said, “It could be as soon as next week,” but did not identify which ones.

The moves are part of the Trump administration’s effort to stabilise Venezuela and encourage the return of US oil producers to the country, a week after

US forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro

in Caracas and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

US sanctions have banned international banks and other creditors from engaging with the Venezuelan government without a license. The institutions have cited this as an impediment to a complex US$150 billion debt restructuring widely viewed as a key to the return of private capital to Venezuela.

On Jan 9 , US President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking courts or creditors from impounding Venezuelan oil revenue held in US Treasury accounts, declaring that these funds should be safeguarded to help Venezuela create “peace, prosperity and stability”.

IMF, World Bank re-engagement

Mr Bessent, who controls the dominant US shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.

He said that the US Treasury would be willing to convert Venezuela’s IMF special drawing rights held at the fund to dollars for use in rebuilding Venezuela.

Venezuela currently has about 3.59 billion SDRs, worth around US$4.9 billion at the J an 9 exchange rate, but cannot currently access them. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and the Chinese yuan.

The Treasury in 2025 agreed to back a US$20 billion swap line for Argentina, partly with that South American country’s SDRs, in an effort to stabilise the peso and help Argentine President Javier Milei’s party win in the parliamentary election.

An IMF spokesperson said the fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined to comment on Mr Bessent’s mention of a meeting next week.

The IMF has not engaged with Venezuela for more than two decades, with the last formal IMF assessment of Venezuela’s economy completed in 2004. Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, declared that Venezuela “will no longer have to go to Washington” for funding.

A source familiar with the World Bank’s internal discussions on Venezuela said that the development lender was in the early stages of exploring how it could be helpful to Venezuela, noting that the bank moved in quickly with assistance to Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes and provided early support to Gaza and Ukraine.

Fast movers

Mr Bessent said he believed that smaller, privately held companies would move swiftly back into Venezuela’s oil sector, despite reluctance voiced by some oil majors, including Exxon Mobil, whose past Venezuelan assets were nationalised twice.

“I think it’s going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly. They haven’t talked about financing at all,” he said.

“Chevron has been there a long time and will continue to be there, so I believe that their commitment will greatly increase.”

Mr Bessent added that he believed there was a role for the US Export-Import Bank in guaranteeing financing for Venezuela’s oil sector, echoing previous comments from US Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

To date in this AI Tech Wave, Apple has been the most visible on stressing Health applications and services across its many platforms, from watches to iphones and other wearables.

And leaning in with its evolving Apple Intelligence to enhance healthcare AI features from hearing tests to body vitals monitoring and measurement.

Other tech companies like Google have also been focused on AI Healthcare Science, in particular with the Alphafold initiatives at Deepmind in particular. I’ve written about AI and Healthcare for a while now in these pages as well..

Now OpenAI is leaning into AI driven healthcare via ChatGPT as well. It’s something that has been building for a couple of years at least. And that is a Bigger Picture worth a discussion this Sunday.

Axios has a number of pieces on this OpenAI initiative in recent days. Including some broader concerns around AI in Healthcare. Axios notes in “OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health tools spark safety debate”:

“Mixed reactions to OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health feature highlight demand for more personalized medical help tempered by chatbot safety and privacy concerns.”

“Why it matters: Health has become a go-to topic for chatbot queries, with more than 40 million people consulting ChatGPT daily for health advice and hundreds of millions doing so each week.”

“Catch up quick: OpenAI is adding a new health tab within ChatGPT that includes the ability to upload electronic medical records and connect with Apple Health, MyFitnessPal and other fitness apps.”

“The new features formalize how many people already use the chatbot: uploading test results, asking questions about symptoms and trying to navigate the complex health care ecosystem.”

“OpenAI says it will keep the new health information separate from other types of chats and not train its models on this data.”

As I’ve outined before, both Trust and Privacy in AI solutions is a fundamental input at scale, which has given companies like Apple a bit of a headstart vs tech companies like Meta, Elon’s xAI/Grok, and others. It’s particularly a big one in healthcare of course.

“Yes, but: Health information shared with ChatGPT doesn’t have the same protections as medical data shared with a health provider, and even those protections vary by country.”

“The U.S. doesn’t have a general-purpose privacy law, and HIPAA only protects data held by certain people like healthcare providers and insurance companies,” Andrew Crawford, senior counsel for privacy and data at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told Axios in a statement.”

“And since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger,” he says.”

“OpenAI is starting with a small group of early testers, notably not those in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom where local regulations require additional compliance measures.”

The market of course will give OpenAI a chance here, given the global popularity of ChatGPT:

“The big picture: Many AI enthusiasts on social media welcomed the tools, pointing to how ChatGPT already helps them.”

“Yana Welinder, head of AI for Amplitude has been using ChatGPT “constantly” for health queries in recent months, both for herself and family members. “The only downside was that all of this lived alongside my very heavy other usage of ChatGPT,” she wrote on X. “Projects helped a bit, but I really wanted a dedicated space …So excited about this.”

“Chatbots aren’t a replacement for doctors, OpenAI says, at the same time highlighting what the chatbot can provide.”

“It’s great at synthesizing large amounts of information,” Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, said Wednesday on a call with reporters. “It has infinite time to research and explain things. It can put every question in the context of your entire medical history.”

But there are big technical problems to solve here as we rush into popular AI tools in front of us:

Especially given mainstream user propensity to humanize and anthropomorphize AI technologies so easily.

“The other side: AI skeptics question giving medical information to a chatbot that has shown a propensity to reinforce delusions and even encourage suicide.”

““What could go wrong when an LLM trained to confirm, support, and encourage user bias meets a hypochondriac with a headache?” Aidan Moher wrote on BlueSky.”

“Anil Dash, advocate for more humane technology, agreed on BlueSky that it “isn’t a good idea,” but also wrote that “it’s vastly more understandable than most medical jargon, far more accessible than 99% of people’s healthcare that they can afford, and very often pretty accurate in broad strokes, especially compared to WebMD or Reddit.”

The thorniest question of course is the fungibility of Data, which is the key ingredient to make AI do anything useful at all, especially in the ‘Physical AI’ world. It’s Box no. 4 in the AI Tech Stack below.

“Between the lines: Like other information shared with ChatGPT, health information could potentially be made available to litigants or government agencies via a subpoena or other court order.”

“That seems particularly noteworthy at a time when access to reproductive health care and gender-affirming care are under threat at both the state and federal levels.”

“User data could get swept up in other ways, too. As part of their copyright battle against OpenAI, news organizations have obtained access to millions of ChatGPT logs, including from temporary chats that were meant to be deleted after 30 days.”

“Sam Altman has called for some sort of legal privilege to protect sensitive health and legal information.”

“What to watch: OpenAI said it has more health features on its road map and will talk soon about additional work with various health care systems.”

Of course, the above discussion centers around OpenAI and other LLM AI chatbots being used by end users for their personal health.

The other side of the coin is the use of AI by pharma companies working with LLM AI companies, to discover and construct better treatments faster and cheaper, using Transformer based AI technologies.

Here, a must read piece by the Economist, “An AI revolution in drugmaking is under way”,provides positive data on how this is actually proceeding in these early AI days:

“It will transform how medicines are created—and the industry itself”.

“Insilico Medicine, a biotech firm in Boston, seems to have been the first to apply the new generation of AI, based on so-called transformer models, to the business of finding drugs. Back in 2019 its researchers wondered whether they could use these to invent new drugs from biological and chemical data. Their first quarry was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease.”

“They began by training an AI on datasets related to this condition and found a promising target protein. A second AI then suggested molecules that would latch onto this protein and change its behaviour, but were not too toxic or unstable. After that human chemists took over, creating and testing the shortlisted molecules. They called the result rentosertib, and it has recently completed successful mid-stage clinical trials. The firm says it took 18 months to arrive at a candidate for development—compared with a usual timeline of four and a half years.”

Fast forward to today, and the numbers are promising indeed:

“Insilico now has a pipeline of more than 40 AI-developed drugs it is assessing for conditions such as cancers and diseases of the bowels and kidneys. And its approach is spreading. One projection suggests annual investment in the field will rise from $3.8bn in 2025 to $15.2bn in 2030.”

“Tie-ups between pharma companies and AI firms are also becoming common. In 2024 a dozen deals were announced, with a combined value of $10bn according to IQVIA, a health-intelligence company.”

Nvidia is also a key company working with big pharma in these new healthcare AI arenas:

“And last October Eli Lilly, another pharma giant, announced a collaboration with Nvidia, the firm whose chips are widely used to train and run transformer-based AI models, to build the industry’s most powerful supercomputer, and thus speed up drug discovery and development.”

And both the pharma and AI industries are figuring out how to make the new economics work under long-established healthcare industry economics and regulatory regimes:

“Given the pharmaceutical industry’s weird economics—candidate drugs entering clinical trials have a 90% failure rate, bringing the cost of developing a successful one to a whopping $2.8bn—even marginal improvements in efficiency would offer big gains. Reports from across the industry suggest that AI has begun to deliver these. AI-designed drugs are whizzing through the preclinical phase (that before human trials begin) in only 12-18 months, compared with three to five years previously. And the success of AI-designed drugs in safety trials is better too. A study published in 2024, of their performance in such trials, found an 80-90% success rate. This compares with historical averages of 40-65%. That, in turn, boosts the overall rate of getting drugs successfully through the entire pipeline to 9-18%, up from 5-10%.”

Include in all this the context of ‘digital twins’ I’ve discussed before, and synthetic patients, and the AI/Healthcare aperture opens up further:

“The most intriguing use of AI to improve trials, though, is the creation of synthetic patients (sometimes called digital twins) to act as matched controls for real participants. To do this an AI goes through data from past trials and learns to predict what might happen to a participant if they follow the natural course of their condition rather than being treated. Then, when a volunteer is enrolled in a trial and given a drug, the AI creates a “patient” with the same set of characteristics, such as age, weight, existing conditions and disease stage. The drug’s efficacy in the real patient can thus be measured against the progress of this virtual alternative.”

“If adopted, the use of synthetic patients would reduce the size of trials’ control arms and could, potentially, eliminate them entirely in some cases. Their use might also appeal to participants, since the chance of receiving the treatment under test rather than being put into a control group without it would rise.”

Zoom out a bit, and one can see positive opportunities for OpenAI and the pharma industry on this end of the AI Healthcare ecosystem.

“Companies such as OpenAI, which led development of the transformers known as large language models, and Isomorphic Labs, a drug-discovery startup spun out of Google DeepMind, are already training systems to reason and make discoveries in the life sciences, hoping these tools will become capable biologists. For now, drug firms have the advantage of a wealth of data and the context to understand and use it, so collaboration is the order of the day. OpenAI, for example, is working with Moderna, a pioneer of RNA vaccines, to speed the development of personalised cancer vaccines. But as the new models make biology more predictable the balance of advantage in the industry may change.”

“Regardless of that, AI has already improved things greatly. If it can wring from late-stage trials the sorts of improvement it has brought to the earlier part of the process, the number of drugs arriving on the market should rise significantly. In the longer run, the possibilities for enhancing human health are enormous.”

The entire piece is worth reading in detail to get a fuller sense of the possibilities around AI and pharma processes to discover and develop new drugs.

This whole area of AI and Healthcare is just beginning to sort out the thorny details at this early point in the AI Tech Wave.

At both ends of AI and the Healthcare pipeline: The creation of drugs and treatments, and how billions of mainstream users interact with the healthcare industry to access the accelerated drugs and treatments. With all the trust and privacy safeguards put in place. And guardrails against AI anthropomorphizing by end users.

And that is the Bigger Picture to keep in mind before we all rush in with AI on our personal health in 2026 and beyond.

This new micromobility solution made its debut in Nvidia’s Showcase section, in part due to the heavy involvement of the chip maker’s DGX Spark technology in the Trinity’s AI-powered heart.

The multi-hyphenate musician, producer and entrepreneur launched yet another side hustle at CES 2026, the Trinity 3-wheeler. This new micromobility solution made its debut in Nvidia’s Showcase section, in part due to the heavy involvement of the chip maker’s DGX Spark technology in the Trinity’s AI-powered heart.

Why a 3-wheeler? Trinity is set up with two driven wheels at the rear, rather than the familiar Morgan-style set-up. Any inherent instability is countered by a tilting system that will angle the bodywork into the corner. This isn’t new technology; it forms the basis of existing machines like the Danish Carver Cruiser and the Helix Autocycle, and dates back all the way to the Mercedes Benz F400 Carving concept from 2001.

What’s new here is the underlying electronics. Described as an ‘organising brain for life on the move, the compact single-seater is driver-focused, not autonomous. The AI is agentic – in that it acts as a bridge between the driver, their personal information, preferences, schedule, itinerary, likes and dislikes.

‘Trinity represents the future of micromobility - where humans, vehicles, and AI agents work together seamlessly,’ says will.i.am, who is set to teach a class called ‘The Agentic Self’ at Arizona State University this Spring.

The underlying benefits of all that Nvidia processing are meant to transform this mode of personal transport into a form of virtual assistant, ‘managing calendars, errands, communications, and cloud services through natural conversation while the human stays focused on driving.'

The car itself has been developed in collaboration with self-balancing tech from New Hampshire-based DEKA, an R&D firm set up by Segway inventor Dean Kamen. The styling was handling by Ryan Friedlinghaus of Southern California’s cult West Coast Customs, a custom auto shop that has worked with will.i.am on many one-off automotive projects, including a radically overhauled Mercedes-AMG GT and a custom DeLorean.

The project will be launched on Kickstarter, with tech specs that point to a performance orientated machine, with a projected range of 150 miles and the ability to hit 60mph in a motorbike-rivalling two seconds. Unlike the two-seat Helix and Cruiser linked above, Trinity only has room for one.

Projected price is around $30,000 and should the crowdfunding campaign be successful, first deliveries are expected in August 2027, with all manufacturing based in LA’s Boyle Heights.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKd3vgSLqX5egRZQAB6MZP-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 02:58:14.360897

Improved Access to the Grenadines St. Vincent serves as the main gateway to the Grenadines, including Bequia, Canouan, and Mustique.
Access is via St. Vincent followed by a connecting flight, positioning it as a more exclusive option within the Grenadines.
What Travelers Should Know The new nonstop flights operate daily through mid-April, covering the core winter season.","One day on Bequia. Another on Mustique. Then a sail to Mayreau. Or maybe a stop on Union. It’s always been one of the best places for island hopping in the Caribbean. It’s actually getting here that’s always been something of a challenge.

That has been changing, though, in recent years, as the country’s new Argyle airport allowed for the first ever international flights from the mainland US and Canada.

And now, St Vincent has another major new route, another boost for a destination that has been drawing increased attention from travelers over the past year.

Delta Air Lines is now officially operating daily nonstop service between Atlanta and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, adding a major new access point during the peak winter travel season.

Daily Nonstop Service Is Now Operating

The route began operating late last month and runs daily through Apr. 12, 2026. Delta is currently the only U.S. carrier offering nonstop service from Atlanta to St. Vincent.

Flights are operated using Boeing 737-800 aircraft with First Class, Delta Comfort+, and Main Cabin seating.

Why This Route Matters Now

St. Vincent has long been one of the more logistically challenging Caribbean destinations to reach from the continental United States. Daily nonstop service significnatly reduces travel time and simplifies trip planning, particularly for winter travelers.

The timing coincides with increased interest in the destination following recent hotel openings and broader visibility for St. Vincent as both a resort base and a gateway to the Grenadines.

Improved Access to the Grenadines

St. Vincent serves as the main gateway to the Grenadines, including Bequia, Canouan, and Mustique. With Atlanta acting as a major hub, travelers from across the U.S. can now reach the islands with fewer connections and more scheduling flexibility.

Delta has positioned the route as part of its expanded winter Caribbean network, targeting destinations that have historically had limited nonstop U.S. airlift.

Where to Stay in St. Vincent and the Grenadines

Sandals Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Opened in 2024, Sandals’ first resort in St. Vincent has been a major driver of new demand for the island. The adults-only, all-inclusive property is located on Buccament Bay and features beachfront rooms and villas, multiple dining venues, and direct access to the main island’s natural attractions, along with some overwater villas, too.

Young Island Resort

One of the Caribbean’s classic private-island resorts, the old-school Young Island sits just offshore from Kingstown and is accessed by short boat transfer. The resort offers standalone cottages, a long-established restaurant, and a low-density, traditional Caribbean atmosphere that takes you back a few decades in a very charming way.

Bequia Beach Hotel

Located on Bequia, this boutique beachfront hotel is a popular choice for travelers looking for a quieter Grenadines experience. Reaching Bequia requires a short onward flight or ferry from St. Vincent, but the island’s relaxed pace and walkable beaches remain a major draw.

Soho Beach House Canouan

Soho Beach House is located on Canouan, offering a private-club-style experience with beach access, dining, and wellness facilities. Access is via St. Vincent followed by a connecting flight, positioning it as a more exclusive option within the Grenadines.

What Travelers Should Know

The new nonstop flights operate daily through mid-April, covering the core winter season. Delta has not yet announced whether the service will continue beyond the current schedule window.

For travelers who have had St. Vincent on their radar, the launch removes one of the biggest remaining barriers to visiting — and places the island more firmly within reach for the 2026 winter season.

Flights are about $547 roundtrip right now, according to what we found on Google Flights.",https://www.caribjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/st-vincent-delta.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 22:58:44.674185

For Adobe, one community member’s Narrative points to a fair value of about US$585.69 per share, while another sits closer to US$271.93.
Emphasizes that if revenue growth, earnings or AI monetization fall short of these already tempered assumptions, the scope for multiple compression could limit upside from current levels.","Adobe currently trades on a P/E of 19.61x. That sits below the Software industry average P/E of 32.59x and well below the peer group average of 59.17x, which means the market is valuing Adobe’s earnings at a lower multiple than many comparable names. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Adobe is 34.68x, which estimates the P/E that might be reasonable given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk characteristics.

The Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with industry or peers because it adjusts for Adobe specific fundamentals rather than assuming all software companies deserve similar multiples. With Adobe’s actual P/E of 19.61x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 34.68x, this approach suggests the shares may be trading at a lower valuation on an earnings multiple basis today.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Adobe Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These let you attach a clear story about Adobe to the numbers you care about, from your assumed fair value through to your revenue, earnings and margin estimates.

A Narrative on Simply Wall St connects three things in one place: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that story implies, and the fair value that follows from those assumptions, all inside an accessible tool on the Community page that is already used by millions of investors.

Once you set up a Narrative, the platform compares your fair value to Adobe’s current share price so you can decide for yourself whether the gap between price and value looks wide enough to consider buying, trimming or simply watching.

Because Narratives update automatically when new information such as news, earnings or guidance is added to the platform, your story and valuation stay current without you needing to rebuild a model each time something changes.

For Adobe, one community member’s Narrative points to a fair value of about US$585.69 per share, while another sits closer to US$271.93. This shows how different investors can look at the same company, apply different revenue, margin and P/E assumptions, and land on very different yet clearly explained views of what the shares might be worth.

For Adobe, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Adobe Narratives:

🐂 Adobe Bull Case

Fair value: US$383.06 per share

Implied discount to fair value: about 12.8% undervalued vs the recent US$333.95 price

Revenue growth assumption: 8.12%

Frames Adobe as a high quality, wide moat business where AI competition is real, but the company still generates strong profitability and maintains a solid balance sheet.

Builds a three-scenario valuation map across bear, base and bull cases, then blends them into a probability-weighted fair value around the mid US$300s.

Assumes revenue growth a little above 8%, profit margins in the high 20s, and a future P/E in the high teens as Adobe settles into life as a mature market leader rather than a high growth outlier.

🐻 Adobe Bear Case

Fair value: about US$271.93 per share

Implied premium to fair value: about 22.8% overvalued vs the recent US$333.95 price

Revenue growth assumption: 6.66%

Focuses on the risk that rising AI-related costs, heavier competition and regulatory pressures compress margins and pull Adobe’s valuation multiple lower over time.

Aligns with the more cautious end of analyst targets, where fair value sits in the low US$270s and assumes slower revenue growth, lower net margins and a mid-teens future P/E.

Emphasizes that if revenue growth, earnings or AI monetization fall short of these already tempered assumptions, the scope for multiple compression could limit upside from current levels.

Put side by side, these Narratives give you a clear sense of the current debate on Adobe, from a supportive view that sees the stock as trading below a reasonable fair value, through to a cautious stance that treats the shares as pricing in more optimism than the numbers justify. If you are building your own view, they can be a useful starting point for deciding which story feels closer to your expectations for growth, margins and the role AI will play in Adobe’s business.

A Dell executive infamously said out loud what AI deniers need to hear: Consumers are not buying PCs ""based on AI."" This was widely reported because of course it was, my industry is terrible. But left unsaid is that Dell doesn't sell that many PCs to consumers, doesn't have an AI strategy for PCs (commercial or consumer), and is such a savvy marketer that it killed off its only solid consumer brand, XPS, last year only to bring it limping back to a market that had lost interest in Dell a decade ago or more anyway. Yeah, we should listen to these people.

Let's look at some numbers.

We're on the cusp of a new round of quarterly earnings reports, but here's what the most recent information about the top PC makers shows us.

Lenovo's Intelligent Devices Group (IDG) is responsible for its PCs, tablets, and phones, and it earned $15.1 billion in the quarter ending September 30, 2025, up 12 percent year-over-year (YOY). Lenovo is decisively in first place in the PC market with a record 25.6 percent market share (unit sales), and it claimed “industry-leading profitability” with over 33 percent of its unit sales now AI PCs. Lenovo is also the world's biggest maker of AI PCs, with 31.1 percent market share. So that seems to be working out pretty well for the company.

HP's PC business earned $10.4 billion in the quarter ending October 31, 2025. Revenues from consumer PC sales were up 10 percent YOY, and HP touted that 30 percent of the PCs it sells now are AI PCs. Looking at its earnings report, I see that net revenues from consumer PC sales were $11 billion, and HP is marketing the hell out of AI. HP, like Lenovo, is building out its own AI chatbot, the HP AI Companion, which is free for customers to use.

Apple reported Mac revenues of $8.7 billion in the quarter ending September 27, a gain of 13 percent YOY. That's pocket change compared to what it earns from the iPhone, but everyone is familiar with how Apple Intelligence is key to Apple's core hardware products, and that it has struggled to get conversational Siri up to its standards. And the reason we know all that is because AI is so important to Apple and its future. Apple doesn't break down consumer and commercial sales, but it's fair to assume the vast majority is consumer-based, or what I could call sales to individuals, not businesses.

So what about Dell? Where does Dell, the sudden genius about consumer PC buying habits and AI, land in all this?

Rock bottom, that's where.

Dell made just $1.9 billion in revenues selling PCs to consumers in the quarter ending October 31, 2025, a decline of 7 percent. Most of Dell's PC revenues come from commercial customers, who want boring, easily locked-down PCs no human being could love.

Spanning judicial, economic, digital, health and fiscal sectors, these measures reflect his strategic foresight, inclusive governance and firm commitment to sustainable development, citizen wellbeing and globally aligned institutional excellence.

Safeguarding family health

The most recent of these landmark measures is Royal Decree No 111/2025 regulating premarital medical examinations, enforced from January 1, 2026. This decree places preventive healthcare at the forefront of social policy by mandating premarital medical screening for every Omani intending to marry, even if the other party is non-Omani and regardless of where the marriage contract is concluded.

Under the decree, accredited health institutions must conduct examinations according to approved scientific and technical standards, inform both parties of their individual results and provide medical counselling when required. Strict confidentiality is guaranteed, with disclosure to third parties prohibited. Upon completion, couples are issued an official certificate, without which marriage officiants are barred from concluding the marriage contract. Penalties for violations include fines and imprisonment, underscoring the seriousness of compliance. This measure highlights the state’s commitment to protecting family stability, reducing health risks and promoting informed marital decisions.

Broadening the revenue base

Royal Decree No 56/2025 introduced the framework for a personal income tax on high-income earners. Scheduled to take effect in January 2028, the tax imposes a modest 5% rate on individuals earning more than RO42,000 annually. Heralded as a pivotal step in fiscal reform, the measure aims to diversify revenue sources and reduce reliance on oil income.

Extensive economic and social studies informed the law’s design – approximately 99% of citizens will remain unaffected due to the high exemption threshold. The framework incorporates deductions and exemptions for education, healthcare, primary housing, inheritance, zakat and charitable donations, reinforcing social justice and fairness. An advanced electronic system developed by the Tax Authority will enable voluntary compliance and accurate income verification. The reform aligns closely with Oman Vision 2040, supporting fiscal sustainability while helping fund the social protection system.

A new era in healthcare

Earlier in 2025, healthcare reform took centre stage with the issuance of two major Royal Decrees. Royal Decree No 43/2025 promulgated the Public Health Law, establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating public health and strengthening coordination between the health sector and other areas of government. Fully aligned with Oman Vision 2040, the law supports inclusive, sustainable health services and provides a reference point for managing public health challenges.

Complementing this was Royal Decree No 44/2025, which established the Transfer and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue Regulation Law. Addressing the rising demand for organ transplants, the law underpins the National Organ Transplant Programme and sets out clear, ethical procedures for organ donation during life or after death. It safeguards the rights and safety of donors and recipients, defines institutional responsibilities and ensures adherence to the highest professional standards. Together, these laws mark a transformative chapter in Oman’s healthcare journey, reinforced by growing expertise, public engagement and unwavering royal support.

Legal foundations for the digital age

As Oman advances its digital transformation, Royal Decree No 39/2025 promulgating the Electronic Transactions Law stands out as a cornerstone reform. The law grants full legal recognition to electronic signatures, contracts and documents, placing these on par with traditional paper-based instruments. This alignment with global digital practices modernises Oman’s legal and commercial frameworks and supports the expansion of e-commerce and digital services.

The law also establishes a trust services management committee to regulate service providers and ensure secure digital interactions, while incorporating safeguards to promote inclusivity, particularly for persons with disabilities. By enabling secure, reliable digital transactions, the legislation enhances investor confidence and strengthens Oman’s standing as a regional hub for digital innovation. Its timing and scope complement broader judicial and economic reforms aimed at building a modern, competitive economy.

A transformative judicial milestone

On March 23, 2025 His Majesty Sultan Haitham issued Royal Decree No 35/2025 establishing the Court of Investment and Commerce – a development widely described as transformative for Oman’s judicial and economic landscape. Designed as a specialised judicial authority with exclusive jurisdiction over commercial and investment disputes, the court consolidates expertise and ensures consistency in rulings.

Its jurisdiction spans a wide array of areas, including foreign investments, banking and financial instruments, maritime sales, insurance, bankruptcy, arbitration-related disputes, intellectual property, electronic commercial transactions and public-private contracts. Efficiency lies at the heart of the new court’s design, with strict timelines for rulings, electronic submission of expert reports and the use of secure video systems for remote hearings. These innovations reduce delays, protect assets and align Oman’s judiciary with leading international standards, significantly enhancing the country’s attractiveness as an investment destination.

Reinventing economic zones

Running parallel to judicial reform was Royal Decree No 38/2025 promulgating the Special Economic Zones and Free Zones Law. This legislation harmonises incentives, exemptions and guarantees across zones while offering special privileges for strategic projects. Central to the reform is a one-stop system that enables investors to obtain all approvals, licences and permits through a single streamlined process, significantly reducing bureaucratic hurdles.

The law goes beyond administrative efficiency by linking incentives to employment generation, local content and high-value-added activities, ensuring that investment directly supports economic diversification. A particularly innovative provision allows freehold residential property sales within economic and free zones, encouraging the development of integrated communities and enhancing the long-term appeal of these zones. The reform positions Oman’s economic zones as dynamic engines of sustainable growth.

These Royal Decrees issued over the past year form a cohesive reform narrative – one that begins with individual wellbeing and family health, extends to fiscal resilience and public health, and culminates in a modern judicial and investment ecosystem. Each decree addresses a critical pillar of national life, yet all are unified by a citizen-centred vision.

Together, these measures reaffirm His Majesty Sultan Haitham’s determination to build a future defined by stability, prosperity and opportunity. By aligning national priorities with global best practices, Oman is confidently charting a path towards a resilient, inclusive and competitive future under the wise leadership of His Majesty.",https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RD.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 19:59:42.672908

INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly and Company and Ventyx Biosciences, Inc., a San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing oral therapies for patients with inflammatory-mediated diseases, today announced entry into a definitive agreement for Lilly to acquire Ventyx.

Ventyx is developing a pipeline of small molecule therapeutics, including NLRP3 inhibitors, designed to treat inflammation across a broad range of disease states with high unmet need. These include opportunities across cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory disorders. The company’s clinical-stage programs target key immune pathways with the goal of offering improved efficacy and safety compared to existing treatments.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel M. Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific and product officer, and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “Ventyx’s clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.”

“Our portfolio of class-leading NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognized as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases,” said Raju Mohan, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Ventyx Biosciences. “We believe that Lilly is an ideal strategic partner, with unparalleled resources, a passion for innovative oral drugs and a commitment to advance novel therapies that fill a vast unmet need for patients suffering from these debilitating diseases and disorders.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ventyx for $14.00 per share of common stock in an all-cash transaction (equal to an aggregate equity value of approximately $1.2 billion). The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to approval by Ventyx stockholders and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

The purchase price payable at closing represents a premium of approximately 62% to the 30-day volume-weighted average trading price of Ventyx’s common stock ended on January 5, 2026. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction.

To demonstrate their commitment to the transaction, entities affiliated with New Science Ventures and all directors and officers of Ventyx have signed voting and support agreements whereby they agree to vote to approve the transaction. The shares subject to the agreements represent a total of approximately 10% of Ventyx’s outstanding common stock.

Lilly will determine the accounting treatment of this transaction in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles upon closing. This transaction will thereafter be reflected in Lilly’s financial results and financial guidance.

BofA Securities, Inc. is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Ropes & Gray is acting as legal counsel to Lilly.

“Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates?
To make sure there’s sufficient demand among bond investors, Treasury yields must remain attractive relative to the competition.
Foreign governments accounted for more than 40% of Treasury bond holdings in the early 2010s, up from just over 10% in the mid-1990s, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month.
“Foreign governments now make up less than 15% of the overall Treasury market.”","In a note on Saturday, he pointed out that Wall Street estimates for the volume of investment grade debt that’s on the way this year reach as high as $2.25 trillion.

That’s as the AI boom increasingly sends companies, including hyperscalers and adjacent firms, to the bond market to fund massive investments in data centers and other infrastructure.

“The significant increase in hyperscaler issuance raises questions about who will be the marginal buyer of IG paper,” Slok said. “Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates? Or might it come from mortgage purchases, putting upward pressure on mortgage spreads?”

With U.S. debt topping $38 trillion, the federal government has already borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October 2025, according to the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office.

That’s $110 billion less than the deficit during the same period a year earlier as tariffs helped revenue outpace spending. But the Supreme Court could strike down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs soon, and this year’s tax season should see a surge of refunds to account for new tax cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Meanwhile, Trump has vowed to boost defense spending to $1.5 trillion a year from $1 trillion, threatening to further deepen federal budget deficits.

And despite the Federal Reserve’s series of rate cuts this past autumn, Treasury yields remain about where they were in early September, suggesting the government will not see much relief on debt-servicing costs that are also contributing to the overall tally of red ink.

“The bottom line is that the volume of fixed-income products coming to market this year is significant and is likely to put upward pressure on rates and credit spreads as we go through 2026,” Slok said.

To make sure there’s sufficient demand among bond investors, Treasury yields must remain attractive relative to the competition. Failure to draw enough investors raises the risk of so-called fiscal dominance, or when a central bank must step into to finance widening deficits.

That’s what former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of last weekend, during a panel hosted by the American Economic Association.

“The preconditions for fiscal dominance are clearly strengthening,” she said, noting debt is on a steep upward trajectory toward 150% of GDP over the next three decades.

At the same time, he holders of U.S. debt have shifted drastically over the past decade, tilting more toward profit-driven private investors and away from foreign governments that are less sensitive to prices.

That threatens to turn the U.S. financial system more fragile in times of market stress, according to Geng Ngarmboonanant, a managing director at JPMorgan and former deputy chief of staff to Yellen during her tenure at Treasury.

Foreign governments accounted for more than 40% of Treasury bond holdings in the early 2010s, up from just over 10% in the mid-1990s, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month. This reliable bloc of investors allowed the U.S. to borrow vast sums at artificially low rates.

“Those easy times are over,” he warned. “Foreign governments now make up less than 15% of the overall Treasury market.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-637420748-e1768070604614.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-10 20:00:02.344870

See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon.

Recent trading has come after a strong run, with the current US$119.04 share price sitting against a 13.87% 3 month share price return and a much larger 61.33% 1 year total shareholder return, suggesting momentum has been building over time.

If you are comparing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation with other financial names, it can also be useful to widen the lens and look at fast growing stocks with high insider ownership for ideas beyond large established institutions.

So with Bank of New York Mellon Corporation trading at US$119.04, a 61.33% 1 year total return and a modest discount to analyst targets, is there still value left on the table, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued

At a last close of US$119.04 versus a narrative fair value of US$119.03, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation is effectively aligned with that framework, which leans heavily on technology, digital assets and capital returns to shareholders.

Accelerated investment in digital platforms (including digital asset custody, AI integration, and the NEXEN ecosystem), coupled with strong early adoption, positions BNY Mellon for improved operating leverage and net margin expansion over the coming years, as scalable technology reduces costs and increases cross-selling opportunities.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious how that tech push, fee based services and long term buybacks are wired into the model? The valuation leans on specific growth, margin and multiple assumptions you may want to test for yourself.

Result: Fair Value of $119.03 (ABOUT RIGHT)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, this story can change quickly if fee pressure weighs on high margin services, or if digital asset disruption chips away at BNY's core custody franchise.

Find out about the key risks to this Bank of New York Mellon narrative.

Another View: Multiples Point To A Cushion

While the fair value narrative lands almost exactly on the current US$119.04 share price, the simple P/E picture looks a bit different. BNY trades on 16.6x earnings, compared with 19.3x for the broader US market, 25.9x for the US Capital Markets industry, and a 30.6x peer average. Our fair ratio sits close by at 16.9x. This suggests the market already prices BNY in line with those fundamentals but with less valuation stretch than many peers. The question is whether that cushion feels like comfort or a sign that expectations are already well calibrated.

However, the business is burning a lot of cash and trades at a premium valuation.

Here's why SoundHound AI stock fell in 2025, and whether you should scoop up some shares at these discounted prices.

AI tailwinds and a history of losing money

SoundHound AI has adeptly expanded its voice-based AI technology during the past few years of the AI revolution. It offers products to support customer service, restaurant drive-thrus, car voice systems, and more, winning numerous contracts worldwide across various industries. Its focus on commercial use cases has helped it win contracts when competing with big technology companies.

Revenue is exploding higher. Sales increased 68% year-over-year to $42 million last quarter. Since going public in 2022, revenue has grown cumulatively by over 1,000%.

So why is the stock down? The primary reason is the company's inability to generate a profit while heavily diluting its shareholders. SoundHound AI's free cash flow was negative $111 million over the last twelve months, a figure that has only gotten worse since it became public. On top of this cash drain, the company has a large stock-based compensation program that is diluting shareholders but is not included in cash flow. Shares outstanding are up over 100% since the company went public, which will be a huge drag on long-term returns.

Should you buy SoundHound AI stock?

Even though SoundHound AI's stock collapsed last year, it still trades at a premium price relative to its trailing revenue. With a market capitalization of $5 billion, the stock has a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 32, which is more than 10 times the average of the S&P 500 Index.

A bull may argue that SoundHound AI is growing quickly, which will bring down this P/S ratio. Investors need to remember, though, that this company is failing to generate positive free cash flow and is heavily diluting shareholders with stock-based compensation. Combine this with a high starting valuation, and SoundHound AI stock does not look attractive even after falling 50% in 2025.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2026-01-10 19:00:37.079637

xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic have been rapidly raising more money, adding to the notion of 'aspirational' valuations across the AI startup scene

OpenAI is expected to raise funds at a $750 billion valuation - 50% above its previous, $500 billion estimated valuation.

The jury is still out on whether creators of popular artificial-intelligence chatbots will be able to work out business models that justify their hefty investments. But that hasn't stopped those companies from racking up ever more money in the private market.

Valuations keep rising for some of the biggest AI unicorns, as evidenced by xAI's announcement Tuesday that it had raised $20 billion in a Series E round that exceeded its $15 billion target. CNBC in November reported that the Grok chatbot maker, launched in 2023 by Elon Musk, was expected to close a $15 billion funding round at a $230 billion premoney valuation.

That would mark a premium compared to what xAI was worth last March when it acquired Musk's social-media platform, X. That transaction valued xAI at $80 billion and X, formerly known as Twitter, at $33 billion. xAI has raised a total of $42.1 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks private capital markets.

""It is likely that the venture market is experiencing an AI bubble. The data checks most of the boxes,"" Kyle Stanford, PitchBook's head of research for the U.S. venture market, said in a recent report.

""The market has shown a sharp price increase, the market narrative has become 'AI versus the rest,' and much of the investment is driven by investor envy and fear of missing out on returns,"" Stanford added.

As of last October, ChatGPT creator OpenAI was worth $500 billion and had raised a total $66.4 billion from investors since its inception, according to PitchBook. Anthropic ended 2025 with more than $39 billion raised since it was founded by former OpenAI employees in 2021. In September, Anthropic was valued at $183 billion, or almost three times what it was worth less than a year earlier.

Anthropic, which develops the Claude chatbot, is now in talks to raise $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, or almost twice what it was worth as of its previous round, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. And OpenAI is planning to raise as much as $100 billion at a $750 billion valuation, according to the Journal. Earlier reports had pinned OpenAI's potential value at as much as $830 billion.

""What's really unprecedented is kind of the size of the investment going into the space right now,"" said Andrew Alden, vice president of quantitative research at Forge Global, which operates a marketplace where investors can trade shares of private companies.

Alden pointed to Forge's trading data, which showed that 45% of volume in 2025 was related to AI companies; that compares with 40% in 2024 and just 18% in 2023. Returns on Forge's dedicated AI basket of 19 companies grew 191% in 2025, according to Alden.

""There still needs to be a validation of the business model, and I think that is coming,"" he said - noting that some companies have ""aspirational"" valuations that are very high compared to the revenue they currently generate.

xAI recorded a net loss of $1.46 billion for its September quarter after spending $7.8 billion across the first nine months of 2025, Bloomberg News reported Thursday. And fresh off its latest fundraise, the company said this week that it will invest $20 billion to build its third data center.

xAI's revenue for the three-month period that ended on Sept. 30 amounted to $107 million. That's almost double what was recorded for its June quarter, according to Bloomberg.

Anthropic, which is reportedly a candidate for a public listing, planned to burn almost $3 billion on $4.2 billion in sales in 2025, the Journal reported in November, citing financial documents showed to investors over the summer.

OpenAI doesn't expect to be cash-flow positive until 2030. By then, HBSC analysts have calculated that it could face a funding shortfall of $207 billion.

The company was on pace to burn $9 billion after generating $13 billion in sales in 2025 as of November, according to the Journal, which cited financial documents. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has said the company was making much more than $13 billion and that revenue was growing ""steeply.""

""Whether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion or $50 billion a year, I don't care - I genuinely don't,"" Altman said in 2024. ""It's going to be expensive. It's totally worth it.""

A representative for OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment. An inquiry sent to xAI received an automated reply. Anthropic declined to comment.

Much of what AI firms are raising is put to work developing data centers and equipping them with expensive hardware, including AI chips. Public hyperscalers, such as Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), could collectively spend potentially $2.9 trillion on AI-related capital expenditures through 2028.

And as companies develop their AI models, they're spending more and more to train them, according to Stanford University's latest AI Index report. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC in early 2024 that it could cost up to $1 billion to train AI models that year. He also forecast that spending on training could rise to as much as $10 billion this year.

""I think this is the fundamental problem with generative AI and LLMs today - they are so expensive,"" said investor Michael Burry, of ""The Big Short"" fame, in a Substack debate published Friday. ""It is hard to understand what the profit model is, or what any one model's competitive advantage will be - will it be able to charge more, or run cheaper?

While OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic have some of the deepest pockets among private AI firms, they're far from the only ones benefitting from investor enthusiasm.

Investment in AI accounted for more than half of the $512.6 billion deployed by venture capitalists around the world in 2025, according to data from PitchBook. A year earlier, investments in AI made up 38% of all venture-capital deal value.

""There are parts of the AI ecosystem that are probably in bubbles,"" Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said last month. ""One example would be just seed rounds for startups that basically haven't even got going yet, and they're raising at tens of billions of dollars.""

Heavy investment in such startups has helped more than 50 individuals working on AI companies become billionaires in 2025, according to Forbes. Edwin Chen, whose 6-year-old business Surge AI refines AI models, is the wealthiest of the new class of AI billionaires, worth about $18 billion.

Read more: AI made tech billionaires even richer this year. Here's how much.

Former OpenAI executive Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation last July in one of the largest seed rounds of all time. By November, barely a month after introducing its first product, it was in talks to raise more cash at a $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported.

Companies working on so-called physical AI, such as humanoid robots and driverless vehicles, have also been popular. Figure AI was most recently valued at $39 billion, while the Alphabet-backed robotaxi firm Waymo is reportedly in talks to join the $100 billion club.

Most of the top 10 venture-capital deals of the December quarter involved companies that heavily integrate AI into their businesses, according to PitchBook data. At the top of the leaderboard was Anthropic's deal with Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft, followed by Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos's cash infusion into his physical-AI startup, Project Prometheus.

Fears of an AI bubble have also been prominent in the public markets. Stock-market bulls have argued that there's still room for companies to grow, while more pessimistic investors say that tech-company valuations are too high and could collapse.

""We see evidence of froth in circular investments between leading AI firms and suppliers, [and] concentrated valuations in a few frontier labs, while at the same time, we think the underlying fundamentals remain orders of magnitude stronger than in prior tech bubbles,"" Truist Securities analysts said in a recent note as they initiated coverage on several AI firms, including Palantir Technologies (PLTR).

Don't miss: Big Tech needs a staggering $1.5 trillion to fund the AI boom. This is the complex playbook it's using to get it.

Pre-order opens January 11 for flights departing from February 11. There are separate meals on offer in February and in March:

February: Barbecue platter Smoked brisket and smoked sausage, paired with creamy mac and cheese, crisp coleslaw and a side of pickles, onions and barbecue sauce

March: Chopped brisket sandwich Chopped brisket on a fresh brioche bun, roasted green beans, creamy potato salad and a side of pickles, onion, and barbecue sauce.

Interstellar Barbecue

Note that this is for DFW departures only. It’s not offered on the return. February’s option sounds far better, though do know that barbecue sauce should really just be for dipping. When the barbecue is any good, you shouldn’t be trying to hide the flavor of the meat. That’s what’s wrong with so many other styles of barbecue.

Although two years ago British Airways served barbecue out of Austin and oddly partnered wtih Aaron Franklin on the sauce (they weren’t serving his meat!). Franklin noted, “if you guys are going to be serving it on a plane… you need to hit the sauce pretty hard.”

Pecan Lodge was an elite barbecue destination a decade ago. I haven’t been in years, so can’t say what it’s like today though I note that while it was once #2 in the Texas Monthly Top 50 biennial barbecue rankings, it’s now fallen off that list completely. (The list itself has declined in value, however.) It’s likely fair to say that Pecan Lodge is not considered in the same league as LeRoy & Lewis, InterStellar, or Franklin.

Franklin Barbecue

Dallas just isn’t the epicenter of Texas barbecue. And that seems to be why people still pay attention to Pecan Lodge (and to Terry Black’s in Deep Ellum, even the original in Austin is overrated). A more legit pick would probably be Goldee’s in Fort Worth.

It seems like partnering with Pecan Lodge should mean (1) brisket, the staple of Texas barbecue, and an easier fit than their beef rib, (2) a side of The Hot Mess, a loaded split sweet potato piled with toppings and sauce. This is the thing people associate with Pecan Lodge.

I love to see American experimenting with new food partnerships, and route-specific food options. This is an airline that hasn’t been serving Australian wine on departures out of Sydney. So shifting its catering for a single set of flights could be a real progress.

And announcing short-term options is great, too. For too long the menus on American’s flights just haven’t varied enough. So offering different things every few months could be another sort of progress as well. It seems like it would be easy to extend a DFW-specific menu option to other flights (certainly easier than scaling it out to other stations).

Back in 2014 Delta partnered with Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group and brought Blue Smoke barbecue onboard as a premium-cabin menu on transatlantic JFK flights. It began with London Heathrow and later expanded to other Europe flights. (They’ve more recently done Fox Bros Bar-B-Q as part of their rotating premium-cabin menu, too.)

This was essentially the start of a broader rotation of Union Square Hospitality Group menus on Delta. (Today you can get a Shake Shack burger, for instance.)

On its own I take this as a ‘premium signal’ from American, copying Delta’s early playbook. American itself links it to its premium efforts as well, tying it to serving better coffee (Lavazza) and champagne (Bollinger). So there’s a strong chance this particular effort is the kickoff of something larger.",https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/interstellar-bbq-plate-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 15:00:14.126176

During the third quarter, Peter Thiel's hedge fund sold out of Nvidia and initiated a position in Apple.

Apple's growth has been sluggish throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, especially compared to Nvidia.

Nvidia is cheaper than Apple based on valuation metrics, but that doesn't necessarily make it the safer buy right now.

Peter Thiel is one of the most iconic Silicon Valley investors. The entrepreneur's first claim to fame was serving as a co-founder of PayPal with none other than the then-unknown Elon Musk.

After minting a fortune through his PayPal ownership, Thiel moved into a professional investor role. Perhaps his most lucrative opportunities came from being the first outside capital invested in Facebook (now Meta Platforms) as well as co-founding data analytics specialist Palantir Technologies.

Today, the tech savant manages capital through a hedge fund, called Thiel Macro. According to the fund's most recent 13F filing, Thiel completely exited his position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) during the third quarter -- selling 537,742 shares.

Interestingly, Thiel swapped his exposure to the most influential player in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena for a stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a stock that Warren Buffett had been trimming prior to his retirement.

Let's dig into what may have influenced these decisions and assess if growth investors should follow Thiel's playbook.

Should you sell Nvidia stock right now?

When OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT on Nov. 30, 2022, Nvidia sported a market capitalization of just $345 billion. As of this writing (Jan. 7), Nvidia's market value is $4.6 trillion -- making it the most valuable company in the world.

While Nvidia's revenue and earnings continue to shatter its own records, underlying activity in the stock suggests investors may be getting a bit leery -- and the rally may finally be fading after three years. Since Nvidia reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Nov. 19, 2025, shares have risen by a rather pedestrian 1.7%.

My suspicion is that growth investors are increasingly weighing the impact competition from other GPU designers such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designers like Broadcom could have on Nvidia's trajectory.

Indeed, Nvidia has numerous opportunities beyond AI accelerators and data centers. However, the timeline and significance of any potential upside from emerging applications remain big question marks at the moment.

This is all to say that investors such as Thiel could be anticipating at least a slowdown to Nvidia's momentum in the near term. As such, rotating capital into more predictable businesses like Apple may seem like the smarter move in terms of maintaining healthy risk-adjusted returns for your portfolio.

Why did Peter Thiel buy Apple stock?

There's a strong case to be made that Apple has achieved the least in terms of AI innovation among its megacap tech peers. Nevertheless, most investors may be overlooking the fact that Apple doesn't actually need to develop a new, groundbreaking device in order to be a winner of the AI revolution.

Apple's installed base of active devices is well north of 2 billion. Against this backdrop, Apple can benefit alongside the proliferation of generative AI as the technology becomes increasingly integrated across its consumer hardware lineup as well as a key driver of services revenue from the App Store.

Nvidia's share price ebbs and flows based on the latest AI-related headline and the health of the company is generally gauged on a quarterly basis when earnings are published. The paradox here is that despite blowing Wall Street's expectations out of the water time and again, Nvidia is slowly being perceived as a high-beta stock given its volatility. Beta is a measurement used to determine a company's risk profile.

By contrast, Apple's growth has been sluggish for a couple of years and the company's AI roadmap has been ambiguous at best. While mundane, Apple is still about as blue chip an opportunity as you'll see in the tech industry.

Despite a lackluster top line, Apple's cash-flow generation remains incredibly robust and predictable. Apple may present an investment opportunity with smoother returns compared to a volatile momentum stock like Nvidia.

Is Apple stock a buy right now?

Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 24. Apple trades at a higher premium, boasting a forward P/E ratio of around 32.

Considering Nvidia's revenue and earnings are accelerating much faster than Apple's, in combination with the company's robust outlook relative to the iPhone maker, Nvidia is the ""cheaper"" stock. But that doesn't necessarily make it the better buy at this exact moment.

I think Thiel's recent portfolio management suggests that he thinks a pronounced correction could be in store for traditional growth and momentum stocks. Generally speaking, when sell-offs occur in more volatile positions, investors will redeploy capital elsewhere -- usually into more durable opportunities with resilient business models.

In my eyes, Apple checks off this criteria. So while Apple stock isn't a bargain, it's likely a safe bet right now for investors with a long-term time horizon.

Advertisers seeking to activate Epsilon data on Microsoft Advertising Platform would need to establish commercial relationships with both Microsoft and Epsilon, negotiate data licensing terms, and complete technical integration requirements.
Implications for search advertising ecosystem The Microsoft-Epsilon integration demonstrates how platform-data provider partnerships reshape competitive dynamics in search advertising.
The search advertising market has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, with Google controlling approximately 90 percent of global search advertising revenue.
Where: The integration operates within Microsoft Advertising Platform across search inventory on Bing, native placements on MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory through Microsoft Audience Network.","Microsoft Advertising announced on January 7, 2026, at CES in Las Vegas that Epsilon data has become available on the Microsoft Advertising Platform through a collaboration with Publicis Media Exchange. The partnership, designated Third-Party Search, combines Microsoft's search advertising infrastructure with Epsilon's consumer identity data and PMX's strategic activation expertise to deliver what the companies characterize as a first-of-its-kind approach to audience targeting across search, native, and display inventory.

The integration enables advertisers to activate Epsilon's consumer insights directly within Microsoft's advertising ecosystem. Epsilon, acquired by Publicis Groupe on July 2, 2019, for $3.95 billion after tax step-up, operates as the holding company's core data technology platform with identity resolution capabilities spanning billions of consumer records.

According to the announcement by Russ Lynn, Agency Director North America at Microsoft Advertising, and Edgar Rodriguez, SVP Partner Management at Epsilon, the collaboration delivers ""a new, first-of-its-kind approach to audience solutions that outperform traditional targeting models."" The system leverages Epsilon's consumer data to identify high-value audiences across Microsoft's advertising inventory with what the companies describe as unprecedented accuracy and scale.

Early testing demonstrates substantial performance improvements over conventional targeting approaches. A pilot campaign in the travel vertical achieved two times higher return on ad spend compared to traditional in-market audiences. The same campaign identified 42 percent net-new targetable audience, converting travelers not previously reached through other first-party audience segments.

Technical infrastructure and data integration

The Third-Party Search framework operates by integrating Epsilon's proprietary identity data with Microsoft Advertising Platform's targeting capabilities. Epsilon maintains comprehensive consumer profiles derived from multiple data sources including purchase history, demographic information, lifestyle indicators, and behavioral signals across digital and offline channels.

Microsoft's advertising ecosystem encompasses search inventory on Bing, native advertising placements across MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory distributed through Microsoft Audience Network. The platform serves advertisements across desktop, mobile, and connected television environments, reaching what Microsoft characterizes as hundreds of millions of monthly active users.

Epsilon's data infrastructure relies on COREid, the company's proprietary identity resolution technology that links consumer records across devices, browsers, and platforms. This system creates persistent identifiers that enable advertisers to recognize and target specific consumer segments even as individuals move between environments and devices.

The integration maintains privacy compliance through what the companies describe as secure data handling protocols. Epsilon's identity graph operates under privacy frameworks including CCPA, GDPR, and industry self-regulatory guidelines, according to the company's technical documentation. The system applies data governance controls that restrict access to individual-level information while enabling aggregate audience targeting.

Travel pilot campaign results and methodology

The travel vertical pilot campaign provides concrete performance metrics demonstrating the integration's capabilities. The test compared campaigns using Epsilon-powered targeting against traditional in-market audience segments, which typically rely on behavioral signals like search query patterns, website visits, and content consumption related to travel categories.

The 42 percent net-new audience metric indicates Epsilon's data identified travelers that Microsoft's standard audience signals had not flagged as high-intent prospects. This expansion suggests Epsilon's offline purchase data, loyalty program information, and cross-channel behavioral tracking captures consumer segments that search behavior alone misses.

The two times higher ROAS improvement represents substantial efficiency gains. If a baseline campaign generated $2 in revenue for every $1 spent, the Epsilon-enhanced targeting would deliver $4 in revenue per advertising dollar. The announcement attributed these results to ""significant efficiency gains and bookings,"" though specific booking volume data was not disclosed.

Travel advertising represents a particularly valuable test case for precision targeting capabilities. The vertical involves high consideration purchases with long planning cycles, multiple research touchpoints, and significant price sensitivity. Travelers frequently research destinations, compare pricing across multiple dates and routes, and consume substantial content before converting. Epsilon's data potentially identifies consumers based on historical travel patterns, credit card spending in travel categories, and loyalty program participation that search queries alone would not surface.

Industry context and competitive positioning

The Microsoft-Epsilon integration arrives as search advertising faces attribution challenges from AI-powered answer engines. Google's implementation of AI Overviews and Gemini-powered search features has created traffic concerns for publishers and advertisers, with some reports indicating substantial declines in click-through rates from search results pages to destination websites.

Microsoft has positioned Bing as an AI-native search experience since integrating ChatGPT-powered features in February 2023. The company's approach emphasizes conversational search interactions and direct answers within the search interface, potentially reducing traditional advertising inventory visibility. Third-party data integration may help compensate for reduced search signal quality as AI features alter user behavior patterns.

Epsilon has expanded partnerships across major advertising platforms, including integrations with Pinterest, Amazon DSP, and programmatic exchanges. The company's March 16, 2024, partnership with Proximic by Comscore added contextual data capabilities, enabling advertisers to combine identity-based targeting with content adjacency controls.

Publicis Groupe has invested heavily in identity resolution capabilities following the Epsilon acquisition. The company announced plans to acquire Lotame in March 2025, combining Epsilon's 250 million consumer profiles with Lotame's 2.3 billion global identifiers. These acquisitions position Publicis Media Exchange as a significant data intermediary capable of activating proprietary identity assets across multiple advertising platforms.

Clean room technology has emerged as critical infrastructure for secure data collaboration in advertising. Epsilon operates clean room environments that enable advertisers to combine first-party data with Epsilon's proprietary datasets without exposing individual customer records. The Microsoft integration likely operates through similar privacy-preserving architecture, though technical implementation details were not disclosed in the announcement.

Publicis Media Exchange activation strategy

Publicis Media Exchange serves as the strategic activation layer connecting Epsilon's data capabilities with Microsoft's advertising inventory. PMX operates as Publicis Media's programmatic trading desk and audience management platform, executing campaigns across display, video, native, audio, and connected television channels for holding company agencies including Zenith, Starcom, Spark Foundry, and Blue 449.

The collaboration positions PMX clients with exclusive early access to Epsilon-powered Microsoft audiences. This arrangement creates competitive differentiation for Publicis Media agencies in new business pitches and client retention, particularly for categories where precision targeting drives substantial performance improvements.

PMX has established direct integrations with major advertising platforms including Google Display & Video 360, Amazon DSP, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo DSP. The Microsoft-Epsilon partnership extends this portfolio with identity-enriched search targeting capabilities that competitors cannot replicate without similar first-party data partnerships.

The travel pilot campaign methodology suggests PMX played an active role in audience strategy and campaign execution rather than simply providing media buying services. The 42 percent net-new audience finding indicates PMX worked with the client to map existing audience segments, identify coverage gaps, and test Epsilon data's incremental reach. This consultative approach positions PMX as a strategic partner rather than a commodity media buyer.

Data partnership economics and market dynamics

Third-party data partnerships typically involve cost-per-thousand-impression fees charged when advertisers activate external audience segments. Industry standard third-party data CPMs range from $0.75 to $2.50 depending on data provider, audience segment specificity, and vertical category, according to Microsoft Advertising's published rate cards.

Premium identity-based segments command higher CPMs than behavioral or contextual targeting alternatives. Epsilon's proprietary consumer data, derived from credit card transactions, loyalty programs, and direct customer relationships, represents higher-value inventory than inferred behavioral signals. The travel pilot's two times ROAS improvement would justify substantial data costs if those fees remained below 50 percent of the efficiency gains.

Microsoft benefits from the partnership through increased advertiser spending on its platform and potential user data enhancement. Search query logs, click behavior, and conversion patterns from Epsilon-targeted campaigns provide training data for Microsoft's own audience modeling systems. Over time, these signals could improve Microsoft's native audience products even for advertisers not purchasing Epsilon data.

Publicis Media Exchange captures value through improved campaign performance that strengthens client relationships and potentially justifies higher agency fees or performance bonuses. The holding company's ownership of Epsilon creates structural incentive to drive data adoption across Publicis Media clients, with increased Epsilon revenue flowing to the parent company regardless of which agency entity executes campaigns.

The competitive dynamics disadvantage independent agencies and advertisers working outside Publicis Media. While Epsilon theoretically makes data available through multiple distribution channels, the Microsoft integration announcement emphasizes PMX's strategic role and does not specify whether non-Publicis advertisers can access Epsilon audiences on Microsoft Advertising Platform through other agency partners or direct relationships.

Audience targeting evolution and privacy considerations

The Third-Party Search collaboration represents broader industry movement toward identity-based targeting as traditional signal sources degrade. Browser restrictions on third-party cookies, Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, and privacy regulations have reduced advertisers' ability to track users across websites and applications without explicit consent.

Search advertising historically relied on query-based targeting and website visitation signals captured through platform pixels. A user searching for ""Hawaii vacation packages"" demonstrates clear commercial intent without requiring cross-site tracking. However, query volume represents only a fraction of potential customers. Many consumers research travel through social media, read review sites, and consume video content without generating search queries that advertisers can target.

Epsilon's data enables Microsoft to reach these consumers based on offline indicators like credit card spending at airlines, hotel loyalty program enrollment, or previous travel booking patterns captured through Epsilon's retail and financial services partnerships. This approach extends search advertising's addressable market beyond users actively generating platform signals.

Privacy advocates have questioned whether such data practices genuinely protect consumer interests. The Federal Trade Commission warned on November 13, 2024, that data clean rooms present ""complicated privacy implications"" despite marketing claims emphasizing privacy protection. The FTC noted that clean rooms enable data sharing between companies that consumers might not expect, even when individual-level records remain encrypted.

Epsilon's data collection practices rely on consumer relationships with brands, retailers, and financial institutions that may not have explicitly disclosed advertising uses. Credit card issuers typically include data sharing provisions in terms of service agreements, but consumers rarely understand how transaction histories inform advertising targeting. The degree to which Epsilon's data practices align with consumer privacy expectations remains subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny.

Implementation and availability

The announcement did not specify commercial availability timelines for Microsoft Advertising clients beyond Publicis Media Exchange. Microsoft Advertising typically deploys new features through phased rollouts, beginning with beta testing among select advertisers before general availability.

Advertisers seeking to activate Epsilon data on Microsoft Advertising Platform would need to establish commercial relationships with both Microsoft and Epsilon, negotiate data licensing terms, and complete technical integration requirements. For Publicis Media clients, PMX handles these operational complexities as part of standard media buying services.

Microsoft Advertising Platform provides self-service and managed service options for campaign execution. Self-service advertisers access the platform through Microsoft Advertising web interface, where they can create campaigns, select targeting parameters, set bids, and monitor performance. Managed service clients work with Microsoft account teams who provide strategic guidance and hands-on campaign optimization.

The travel pilot campaign's success metrics will influence adoption patterns across other vertical categories. Travel advertising's strong results may not translate directly to retail, automotive, financial services, or other sectors with different customer journey patterns and conversion behaviors. Advertisers in these categories would need to conduct their own testing to validate Epsilon data's effectiveness for their specific use cases.

Microsoft has historically positioned itself as a privacy-forward alternative to Google's advertising ecosystem, emphasizing user control and data transparency. The Epsilon partnership introduces third-party data elements that complicate this positioning, potentially creating tension with Microsoft's stated privacy commitments. How Microsoft communicates data usage policies to consumers and advertisers will influence perception of the partnership's privacy implications.

Implications for search advertising ecosystem

The Microsoft-Epsilon integration demonstrates how platform-data provider partnerships reshape competitive dynamics in search advertising. Google maintains proprietary user data from Chrome browser usage, Android device data, Google Maps location tracking, YouTube viewing behavior, and Gmail engagement signals. This integrated data ecosystem enables sophisticated audience targeting that Microsoft historically could not match using Bing search signals alone.

By partnering with Epsilon, Microsoft gains access to consumer identity data that partially compensates for its smaller user base and limited first-party data assets. However, the partnership structure creates dependencies that Google avoids through vertical integration. Microsoft must share revenue with Epsilon and relies on a third party for critical targeting capabilities rather than controlling the entire data infrastructure.

Google has faced regulatory pressure to limit data integration across its properties, particularly in Europe where competition authorities have questioned whether combining user data from multiple services creates unfair competitive advantages. Microsoft's partnership model might face less regulatory scrutiny because data combination occurs through commercial agreements rather than single-company data aggregation.

The search advertising market has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, with Google controlling approximately 90 percent of global search advertising revenue. Microsoft's Bing accounts for roughly 3 percent market share in the United States, limiting its ability to invest in data infrastructure at Google's scale. Strategic partnerships with data providers like Epsilon represent a viable alternative strategy that leverages external assets rather than attempting to build competitive capabilities organically.

Advertiser response to the Third-Party Search collaboration will depend on whether Epsilon-enhanced targeting delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse campaign types and whether data costs remain justified by efficiency gains. The travel pilot's strong results provide encouraging initial evidence, but sustained adoption requires proof that benefits extend beyond single-vertical testing environments.

Summary

Who: Microsoft Advertising partnered with Publicis Media Exchange and Epsilon to launch Third-Party Search, a data integration enabling precision audience targeting. Russ Lynn, Agency Director North America at Microsoft Advertising, and Edgar Rodriguez, SVP Partner Management at Epsilon, announced the collaboration. Publicis Groupe owns Epsilon following a $3.95 billion acquisition completed July 2, 2019.

What: The integration makes Epsilon's consumer identity data available on Microsoft Advertising Platform for targeting across search, native, and display inventory. The system combines Microsoft's advertising reach with Epsilon's proprietary consumer insights and PMX's activation expertise. A travel vertical pilot campaign achieved two times higher return on ad spend compared to traditional in-market audiences and identified 42 percent net-new targetable audience not previously reached through other first-party segments.

When: Microsoft Advertising announced the partnership on January 7, 2026, at CES in Las Vegas. The travel pilot campaign preceded the public announcement, though specific testing dates were not disclosed. Commercial availability beyond Publicis Media Exchange clients remains unspecified.

Where: The integration operates within Microsoft Advertising Platform across search inventory on Bing, native placements on MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory through Microsoft Audience Network. Epsilon's identity data derives from consumer relationships across retail, financial services, and loyalty programs spanning offline and digital channels. Publicis Media Exchange manages strategic activation for holding company agency clients.",https://ppc.land/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/Epsilon-Data.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:59:47.017749

For defense investors, it's not so much the ending of a calendar year that's important, but the ending of a fiscal quarter. Because every time a quarter ends, there's a mad dash at the Pentagon to shovel out a last few spadefuls of cash, in the form of big-ticket defense contracts. It's a race against the clock (or the calendar) to ensure every last cent of funds already approved by Congress goes to the programs that need funding.

And for giant defense contractors like Boeing (BA +3.15%), it's a chance to cash in.

$12.8 billion for Boeing -- or with luck, $17.5 billion

And boy, oh boy, did Boeing ever cash in last month. On Dec. 29, Boeing won each of the two biggest Pentagon contracts awarded. For $4.2 billion, Boeing was tasked with providing ""E-4B contractor logistic service"" to the U.S. Air Force in fiscal 2026 (which ends Sept. 30, 2026).

Then, for $8.6 billion, Boeing won an order to build and deliver at least 25 new F-15IA aircraft to the Israeli Air Force, with an option for 25 more. Seeing as $8.6 billion would imply an MSRP of $343 million per plane (which is quite a high price for a fourth-generation fighter jet), it's likely Boeing will only receive the full $8.6 billion if Israel exercises its option and buys all 50 F-15s. But even if it doesn't, even if Israel only takes the initial 25, that's still a $4.3 billion contract for Boeing, minimum -- and $8.5 billion total from the two contracts.

Not bad for a day's work.

(Just two days later, by the way, Boeing would win another $2.7 billion for ""post-production support"" on AH-64 Apache helicopters for the U.S. Army. Add in another $2 billion for a Dec. 23 contract for B-52 commercial engine replacement, and Boeing may have cleared as much as $17.5 billion in new revenue in just over a week.)

What does it mean for investors?

All four of these contracts, by the way, fall under the aegis of Boeing's Defense, Space, and Security (BDS) business. Combined, they add up to about 73% of all the revenue that business segment generated in all of 2024.

Why is this significant? Well, consider that while BDS has had its issues, notably with the Starliner spacecraft that it produces, which still isn't cleared for use in human spaceflight, BDS is at least profitable today.

It's not very profitable, earning less than a 2% operating profit margin through the three quarters of 2025 that have already been reported. Still, just being profitable at all is more than Boeing can say about its marquee commercial aircraft division, which continues to lose money at a rate of nearly $8.6 billion per year.

What else does this mean for investors?

Another fact worth highlighting for investors may be less immediately obvious. Re-read my description of those four contracts described above. What do you notice?

One thing you might notice is that only one of the four contracts (the F-15 sale) is actually a contract for Boeing to produce and sell aircraft. The other three are for (1) running logistics for E-4B airborne command centers, (2) support of Apache helicopters, and (3) replacing engines on B-52 bombers.

All three of these activities relate to services the aerospace company provides to its aircraft after they're sold. Money Boeing gets without having to win a hard-fought competition to make a sale to a customer. Money Boeing will get almost by default, by virtue of being the company that built the aircraft in the first place.

If you suspect revenue won in this manner might be just a wee bit more profitable for Boeing than the margins it makes when having to win a bidding war, well, you'd be right. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing booked $15.7 billion in parts, maintenance, modifications, and logistics services under its global services business. This is the smallest of Boeing's business divisions -- but by far the most profitable, earning an operating margin of 18.6%.

All of which is to say: When researching Boeing, and deciding whether you might want to buy Boeing stock, don't necessarily ignore the big, headline-grabbing contract wins that Boeing announces. But do keep in mind:

Boeing doesn't make its money when it wins a contract. Boeing makes its money in the years after winning the contract. And that makes Boeing Global Services by far the most important business segment at Boeing.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849439%2Ff-15e-fighter-jet-in-flight.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-10 17:00:22.917883

Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it.","Las Vegas, NV (CNN) — Robots took over the floor at the biggest technology show of the year: I watched a towering humanoid robot march forward, spin its head and wave at an excited crowd. Then I almost bumped into a four-legged doglike robot behind me.

They’re just a couple of the many robots I encountered this week designed for a range of purposes, from playing chess to performing spinal surgery. These are common occurrences on the Las Vegas Convention Center’s show floor during CES, which wrapped on Friday. Every January, companies from around the world gather to flaunt new technologies, products and services.

The show is just as much spectacle as it is substance; many of the most eye-catching wares either haven’t come to fruition (like flying cars) or are wildly expensive and impractical (think TVs that cost tens of thousands of dollars). But CES provides a glimpse into the bets being made by industry giants like Nvidia, Intel, Amazon and Samsung.

AI once again dominated the conference. Companies showed off everything from humanoid robots they claim will staff factories to refrigerators you can open with your voice to the next-generation chips that will power it all. CES, in some ways, turned the Strip into a bubble of its own, shielded from AI skepticism.

CNN asked a handful of tech executives at CES about an AI bubble and how it might impact their businesses. Some said their businesses aren’t relevant to the bubble concerns, while others expressed optimism about AI’s potential and said they are focused on building products that show it.

“We’re in the earliest stage of what’s possible. So when I hear we’re in a bubble, I’m like… This isn’t a fad,” said Panos Panay, Amazon’s devices and services chief. “It’s not going to pass.”

Growing concerns of an AI bubble

Tech companies poured more than $61 billion into data center investments in 2025, according to S&P Global, fueling concerns that investments may be far outpacing demand.

And investments are only expected to grow, with Goldman Sachs reporting that AI companies are estimated to invest more than $500 billion in capital expenditures this year. Julien Garran, researcher and partner for research firm MacroStrategy Partnership, said in a report last year that the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot com bubble.

Most of the concerns around an AI bubble have centered on investments in data centers built for AI tasks that are too power-hungry for devices like laptops and smartphones to handle alone. Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom and the company at the center of the bubble debate, announced at CES that the next version of its computing platform that powers those data centers is arriving in the second half of this year.

When asked about the AI bubble, executives from chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm pointed to their respective companies’ efforts to improve how computers process AI tasks locally rather than in the cloud.

Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other products, announced last year that it’s expanding into data centers. But that represents a very small part of its business.

“As far as we’re concerned, where we operate is not where the bubble conversation exists,” Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told CNN.

Intel is focused on products that are important to its consumers, like chips that boost laptop performance, rather than making a big bet “that takes a lot of investment that may or may not make it,” said its client computing group head, Jim Johnson.

CK Kim, executive vice president and head of Samsung’s digital appliances business, said in an interview through an interpreter that it’s not for him to say whether the industry is in an AI bubble. He added that the company is more focused on whether AI is bringing value to consumers.

AI and the hunt for the next big thing

What that “value” looks like is exactly what the thousands of exhibitors at CES tried to demonstrate this week. Humanoid robots were a big part of that equation for companies like Nvidia, Intel, Hyundai and Qualcomm, all of which announced new tech to power human-shaped robots.

Boston Dynamics and Hyundai debuted Atlas, a humanoid robot developed in partnership with Google’s DeepMind AI division designed for industrial work like order fulfillment. It’ll be deployed to Google DeepMind and Hyundai’s Robotics Metaplant Applications center in the coming months, and additional customers will adopt it in early 2027.

“With one investment, we can explore any application in the world, from industrial use cases to retail use cases to home use cases,” Aya Durbin, who leads Boston Dynamics’ humanoid application product strategy, said in an interview at Hyundai’s booth when asked what’s driving the interest in humanoid robots. (Hyundai owns a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics.)

Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it. At CES, a wave of companies introduced discrete listening devices that can record conversations or voice notes. These products included AI jewelry from a startup called Nirva, the Index 01 ring from smartwatch maker Pebble and the now Amazon-owned wristband from Bee.

Speaking to gadgets is often faster than typing, but Amazon and Nirva also see their devices as another means to gather data that can provide insights about a user’s life, though doing so will surely raise privacy concerns.

Business leaders seem to agree that AI is here to stay — even for those like Pete Erickson, CEO of tech events and education company Modev, who said the industry is indeed in a bubble.

But Erickson also believes AI is “just a part of our lives” now.

“I don’t think it’s going anywhere,” he said.

Lilly rode explosive GLP-1 drug demand to 53.9% revenue growth. Johnson & Johnson leaned on diversification across medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer health to post 6.8% growth.

GLP-1 Momentum Versus Diversified Stability

Lilly’s quarter centered on its diabetes and obesity franchise. Revenue hit $17.6 billion, driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound demand that management described as supply-constrained rather than demand-constrained. Net income of $5.6 billion jumped 480% year over year, as operating margin expanded to 48.3%. Gross margin reached 82.9%, reflecting the pricing power and manufacturing efficiency of blockbuster biologics.

Johnson & Johnson’s $24.0 billion in revenue came from a broader base. Medical device sales benefited from elective procedure volume recovery. Pharmaceutical revenue grew on newer immunology and oncology drugs, though legacy products faced biosimilar pressure. The 69.6% gross margin and 30.2% operating margin reflect a more complex cost structure spanning manufacturing, distribution, and regulatory compliance across multiple product categories. Net income of $5.2 billion rose 91% year over year, driven partly by one-time gains visible in its Q1 2025 blowout of $4.54 EPS against $2.26 expected.

Metric Lilly Johnson & Johnson Revenue Growth 53.9% YoY 6.8% YoY Operating Margin 48.3% 30.2% Net Income Growth 480% YoY 91% YoY R&D Spending $4.1B $3.7B

One Franchise Versus Portfolio Breadth

Lilly’s strategy concentrates risk and reward in a single therapeutic area. GLP-1 drugs now define the company’s valuation and growth trajectory. Management invested $4.1 billion in R&D during the quarter, much directed toward expanding manufacturing capacity and developing next-generation obesity treatments. The forward P/E of 33.78 reflects confidence that demand will sustain through patent cliffs and competitive entries.

Johnson & Johnson spreads exposure across devices, pharmaceuticals, and international markets. The company spent $3.7 billion on R&D allocated across oncology, immunology, cardiovascular devices, and surgical robotics. This diversification limits upside but cushions against single-product risk. The forward P/E of 18.05 and 2.45% dividend yield position J&J as a defensive holding rather than a growth bet.

Oral Competition and Manufacturing Scale

The next inflection point for Lilly involves oral GLP-1 competition. Novo Nordisk’s oral Wegovy approval in December 2025 triggered sustained Reddit discussion, with one thread generating 168 upvotes and comments noting the shift from injections to pills could reshape patient preferences. Lilly must prove its injectable franchise can hold share as oral alternatives scale.

Johnson & Johnson faces different tests. Device segment growth depends on hospital capital spending, which remains uneven. Pharmaceutical revenue needs newer drugs to offset biosimilar erosion on older biologics.

Why I Lean Toward Lilly Despite the Premium

I would choose Lilly for exposure to a transformational drug category that still has room to run. The 480% earnings growth and 48.3% operating margin suggest the GLP-1 franchise is hitting scale efficiently. The P/E of 53.22 looks steep, but the PEG ratio of 1.01 indicates growth justifies the multiple. Oral competition is real, but Lilly’s manufacturing lead and pipeline depth give it time to adapt.

Johnson & Johnson fits a different investor. If you prioritize income and stability over growth, the 2.45% yield and diversified revenue base make sense. The stock gained 44.84% over the past year, but long-term returns lag dramatically. Lilly delivered 587.71% over five years versus J&J’s 51.34%.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry31-0VG.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:03:12.569381

The HP EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC is expected to be available on HP.com in March.","HP (Hewlett-Packard) has unveiled the EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC, a remarkably slim and lightweight keyboard with an integrated computer system, scheduled for release in March this year.

The EliteBoard G1a measures just 17 millimetres in thickness and weighs 630 grammes (1.4 pounds, making it roughly half the weight of a conventional laptop. Designed for mobility, the device supports external 4K monitor connectivity and offers a battery life of up to 3.5 hours per charge.

According to HP, the concept for the all-in-one keyboard was born from observing hybrid work trends. Designers noticed that many users connect their laptops to external monitors only to close the laptop lid immediately. This led to the question: ""If an external monitor is already being used, why not put the computer inside the keyboard?""

The hardware distinguishes itself from standard mini personal computers (PCs) through its high level of customisability. Users can remove the back cover to swap or upgrade components, including DDR5 SODIMM RAM, M.2 NVMe SSDs, batteries, speakers and fans. The keyboard panel itself is also spill-resistant and replaceable.

The American tech company will offer the device in two configurations. One features a fixed USB-C cable but includes an additional USB4 port and a bundled wireless mouse. The second variant offers a detachable USB-C cable for greater flexibility.

To appeal to professional typists, the EliteBoard G1a features tuned key travel to replicate a desktop experience and includes a full numpad. This positioning aims to provide a desktop-grade feel in a highly portable format for off-site work.

However, the device's ultra-slim profile presents certain practical challenges. Despite its portability, the lack of a built-in display means users must still carry a portable monitor. Furthermore, the limited 3.5-hour battery life and the presence of only two USB-C ports may necessitate the use of additional docks or power banks.

Discover how International Business Machines positions its AI and hybrid cloud portfolio

In the latest trading session, International Business Machines stock changed hands close to the mid point of its recent band, with only a modest move compared with the broader tech sector. Over the past five trading days the shares have essentially moved sideways, oscillating within a narrow percentage range around the current quote. Short term traders are seeing more noise than signal, while long term investors take comfort from the fact that the stock has not broken below recent support levels.

Looking at the five day performance, International Business Machines has posted small alternating gains and losses, netting out to only a marginal move by the end of the week. Intraday swings have remained contained, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears have been willing or able to seize control. This muted action stands in contrast to the past three months, where the stock has advanced at a solid double digit clip from its autumn base, drawing increasing attention from income oriented investors who also want some AI exposure.

Zooming out, the 90 day trend remains constructive. From its early quarter levels, International Business Machines has climbed meaningfully, outpacing the broader value oriented indices while lagging the highest growth AI names. The stock currently trades closer to the upper half of its 52 week range, sitting below its recent 52 week high but comfortably above the 52 week low. This positioning reflects cautious optimism. Investors are willing to price in progress on cloud and AI driven revenues, yet they are not ready to award IBM the premium multiples reserved for pure play hyperscalers or software as a service leaders.

On a technical level, the share price is consolidating after a multi month advance. Key moving averages on the daily chart have flattened, confirming this pause in momentum. Volume has tapered off compared with the spikes seen during earlier rallies, reinforcing the sense that the market is catching its breath. If the price can hold above nearby support and eventually re test the 52 week high, the current band may be remembered as a healthy consolidation. If support gives way on heavy volume, it will instead be read as the exhaustion of the latest leg up.

One-Year Investment Performance

What if an investor had bought International Business Machines stock exactly one year ago and simply held through every AI headline, every macro scare and every earnings call since then? The answer is quietly encouraging. Based on the closing price from one year back compared with the latest last close, IBM shares have delivered a solid percentage gain in the high single digits to low double digits, before dividends. Factor in the company’s hefty cash payout and the total return edges higher, turning what could have been a sleepy position into a respectably performing core holding.

To put this into concrete terms, imagine a hypothetical investor who deployed 10,000 dollars into IBM stock at the closing price one year ago. At today’s last close, that stake would now be worth meaningfully more, translating into a profit of several hundred to over a thousand dollars on paper, depending on the precise purchase level within that day’s trading range. Add in the dividends collected over the period and the overall return climbs further. The ride has not been smooth, with pullbacks during broader tech risk offs and bursts of enthusiasm around AI announcements, but the net result over twelve months is clearly positive.

Emotionally, that kind of steady if unspectacular gain can be deceptively powerful. It rewards patience without the adrenaline spikes that come with chasing high beta momentum trades. For a dividend investor, IBM has done what it was expected to do: throw off consistent income while gradually appreciating in price. For a growth oriented trader, the same chart looks tame compared with faster moving AI names, yet even they have to acknowledge that compounding respectable single digit to low double digit annual gains can be a winning strategy over time, particularly when backed by a fortress balance sheet.

Recent Catalysts and News

Recent days have brought a steady stream of incremental news rather than a single game changing headline for International Business Machines. Earlier this week, several tech and business outlets highlighted IBM’s continued push into enterprise generative AI, anchored by its watsonx platform. Coverage from sources such as CNET, TechRadar and Business Insider underscored IBM’s strategy of embedding AI capabilities into existing enterprise workflows rather than chasing consumer oriented chatbots. The company has been promoting reference wins with large financial institutions and industrial clients, signaling that AI is moving from pilot projects to production workloads inside its customer base.

Around the same time, financial media including Bloomberg, Reuters and Yahoo Finance focused on IBM’s positioning ahead of its upcoming earnings release. Commentators pointed out that the stock has already enjoyed a re rating on the back of AI optimism over the previous quarter, which raises the bar for the next set of numbers. Analysts are watching closely for signs that software and consulting segments tied to hybrid cloud and AI can offset slower, legacy oriented infrastructure revenues. Any upside surprise on recurring software revenue or bookings tied explicitly to watsonx and Red Hat could give the shares fresh momentum. Conversely, a conservative outlook or soft free cash flow guidance could quickly cool the recent enthusiasm.

Investor attention has also turned to IBM’s ongoing portfolio reshaping. In the past few days, commentary in outlets such as Forbes and Investopedia revisited the longer term impact of the earlier Kyndryl spin off and the more recent focus on higher margin software and consulting lines. The narrative emerging across these pieces is that IBM is finally being rewarded, at least partially, for a strategic pivot that took years to execute. However, several columnists caution that competition from hyperscalers and best of breed software vendors remains intense, and that IBM must prove it can win new workloads instead of simply protecting its installed base.

Importantly, there have been no major negative surprises in the past week. No sudden management reshuffles, no unexpected legal settlements and no abrupt changes to capital allocation have hit the tape. In the absence of shock events, the stock’s day to day moves have been dictated largely by shifting expectations around AI adoption speed, enterprise IT budgets and interest rate trajectories. This quiet backdrop aligns neatly with the stock’s consolidation on the chart, reinforcing the impression of a calm before whatever catalyst earnings and macro data will next provide.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street’s view on International Business Machines over the past month has been nuanced rather than unanimously bullish or bearish. Several major investment banks have updated their models recently, and their stance helps explain the stock’s relatively tight trading band. According to recent research notes reported by outlets such as Bloomberg and Reuters, banks including Morgan Stanley and UBS currently sit in the neutral camp with equal weight or hold ratings, arguing that the shares are fairly valued relative to near term growth prospects. Their price targets cluster only modestly above the current quote, implying limited upside in the absence of clear evidence that AI can accelerate revenue growth.

On the more constructive side, firms like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank have reiterated buy or overweight ratings in the last few weeks, highlighting IBM’s rising mix of software and the durability of its cash flows. Their published targets stand noticeably higher than the prevailing market price, suggesting that they see room for multiple expansion if IBM can deliver consistent mid single digit revenue growth combined with disciplined cost control. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, for their part, have maintained a more cautious tone, keeping neutral ratings while tweaking targets in line with sector wide revaluations. In aggregate, the consensus across the street lands around a hold, with a modestly positive skew driven by those who believe in IBM’s AI execution.

For investors, the message is clear. This is not a battleground stock where bears are calling for collapse and bulls are promising moonshots. Instead, analysts are effectively saying that IBM is a stable, cash generative name where upside depends on the pace at which AI and hybrid cloud initiatives can translate into tangible top line acceleration. Dividend yield and balance sheet strength form the floor under the shares, while skepticism around IBM’s ability to out innovate younger rivals caps the ceiling, at least in current models.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Looking ahead, the fate of International Business Machines stock over the coming months will hinge on whether the company can convert its strategic buzzwords into hard numbers. The core of IBM’s business model today is a blend of hybrid cloud infrastructure, Red Hat centered open source software, consulting services aimed at digital and AI transformation, and a legacy hardware and mainframe segment that still throws off cash. The strategy is to use consulting as the tip of the spear, land AI and cloud projects with large enterprises, then scale those engagements into recurring software and platform revenue built on watsonx and Red Hat technologies.

Several factors will determine whether this strategy pays off for shareholders. First, enterprise IT budgets must remain resilient despite macro uncertainty. If chief information officers continue to prioritize automation and AI projects, IBM is well placed to win its share of that spend, particularly in regulated industries where trust, compliance and long standing relationships matter. Second, IBM has to demonstrate that watsonx is more than a marketing brand. Concrete case studies, measurable productivity gains for clients and growing AI related revenue disclosures will be critical to convincing investors that this is a sustainable growth engine rather than a passing theme.

Third, margin discipline will be under the microscope. Shifting the mix toward higher margin software and away from lower margin hardware and transactional services should gradually lift profitability, but only if IBM manages the transition without bloating costs. Finally, capital allocation will continue to attract scrutiny. The company’s generous dividend is a key part of the bull case, yet investors also want to see enough flexibility to fund targeted acquisitions and ongoing share repurchases without stretching the balance sheet.

In the near term, the most likely scenario is a continuation of the current consolidation phase, punctuated by sharper moves around earnings and major AI related announcements. If IBM can deliver a few quarters in a row of consistent growth in software and consulting tied explicitly to AI and hybrid cloud, the stock could reasonably grind higher toward the upper end of analyst target ranges and challenge its recent 52 week high. If, on the other hand, AI revenue fails to materialize at the anticipated pace, International Business Machines will probably slip back into the market’s mental bucket of reliable but uninspiring dividend names. For now, the balance of evidence supports a cautiously constructive stance, with the charts signaling patience and the fundamentals demanding proof.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405056_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 11:01:22.232522

Thanks to its advanced fuselage and engine technology, the A350 is today one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft in the skies, particularly when deployed on long-distance routes.

The Airbus A350 is the primary competitor of Boeing's popular 787 series of aircraft, and as of May 2025, a total of 658 have been built and delivered. In this article, we take an in-depth look at one of the A350's operational features - its service ceiling. The A350's service ceiling is around 43,000 ft, which is higher than many other commercial aircraft. Which factors contribute to the aircraft's high service ceiling?

What Is A Service Ceiling?

Firstly, let's establish what the service ceiling is when talking about aircraft. Put simply, the service ceiling is the maximum altitude at which an aircraft can fly and continue to operate normally and maintain a specific rate of climb. Once flying at or close to its service ceiling, an aircraft's ability to climb is significantly reduced due to the thinner air found at higher altitudes. The typical service ceilings of some of the most common commercial aircraft found in the skies today are outlined in the table below.

By contrast, an aircraft's absolute ceiling is the altitude that it can reach without being able to climb any further. There are many factors, often related to the aircraft's design, that can affect its service ceiling. Let's take a closer look at some of these.

Lighter Materials & Better Aerodynamics

Large parts of the Airbus A350's fuselage and wings are made up of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, which is much lighter than other traditionally used materials such as aluminum. This reduced weight allows the aircraft to perform better at higher altitudes.

The Airbus A350 also has a streamlined and aerodynamic design, which is the result of years of work from Airbus' design teams, and several redesigns throughout the early years of the aircraft's development. The aircraft's swept wings, winglets, and sleek fuselage all help it to reduce drag, and therefore improve performance at higher altitudes, including up to its service ceiling of 43,000 ft.

Improved Engine Technology & Fuel Efficiency

It is not just the aircraft itself that makes the Airbus A350's service ceiling so high. The aircraft is equipped with two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, which feature advanced technology, making them among the most efficient and powerful commercial aircraft engines currently available. The Trent XWB is designed to perform well at high altitudes where the air is thinner.

The Airbus A350's Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines help the aircraft to achieve a high level of fuel efficiency. Not only is this important in helping airlines to keep costs as low as possible and to meet ambitious sustainability targets, but it also allows the aircraft to operate more efficiently at higher altitudes, raising its service ceiling.

Greater Passenger Comfort

Like many other aircraft, including the Boeing 787, the Airbus A350 features an advanced cabin pressurization system, which maintains a cabin altitude of around 6,000 ft, compared to the average of 8,000 ft on older aircraft. This allows the A350 to operate at higher altitudes without negatively impacting passenger comfort. As a result, passengers can enjoy a cabin pressure and atmosphere more similar to the one that they experience on the ground, with reduced fatigue.

Given the extra-long length of many of the routes operated by the Airbus A350, passengers are sure to appreciate this feature. For example, the A350 will soon be used by Qantas to operate its Project Sunrise direct flights from Australia to both Europe and the US. It is also currently deployed by the likes of Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways on some of the world's longest commercial flight routes.

All About The Airbus A350

The idea of the Airbus A350 was first developed by the European manufacturer in 2004, in response to Boeing's upcoming 787 program. After several redesigns, the aircraft was eventually certified by both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Agency (EASA) in 2014, and went on to enter commercial service with Qatar Airways just a few months later in January 2015 on a flight from Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH) to Frankfurt Airport (FRA).

The Airbus A350-1000 also entered commercial service with Qatar Airways on a flight from Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH) and London Heathrow Airport (LHR). The A350 has proved to be a resounding commercial success for Airbus, and to date, more than 650 A350s have been built, across the two main passenger variants - the A350-900 and the larger A350-1000. Thanks to its modern appearance and extra passenger comforts, the A350 has proved to be popular with passengers too.

Data from ch-aviation shows that the world's largest operator of the Airbus A350 is Singapore Airlines, followed closely by Qatar Airways. Singapore Airlines has a total of 65 A350s, including seven A350-900ULRs (ULR = ultra-long-range), which the Star Alliance carrier deploys on its longest routes between Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) and US destinations such as New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

As of last year, Airbus still had a delivery backlog of more than 700 A350s awaiting production and delivery, with the aircraft's popularity showing no sign of slowing down.

Many Factors Contribute To The Airbus A350's High Service Ceiling

The Airbus A350 has a service ceiling of around 43,000 ft, meaning that it can comfortably continue to operate normally at such altitudes. That said, it is unusual for a commercial aircraft to fly at such a high altitude for any real length of time. There are a number of different factors that contribute to the A350's higher-than-average service ceiling.

As one of the most technologically advanced aircraft in the world, the Airbus A350 is able to fly at high altitudes. This is aided by its lightweight, composite fuselage, streamlined aerodynamics, and improved fuel efficiency.

The Airbus A350's industry-leading operational performance and full efficiency, which have contributed to it having a high service ceiling, have also secured the aircraft's commercial success. Thanks to its impressive credentials, the A350 is now a common sight in the skies around the world and is operated by more than 40 different commercial airlines around the world.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/deltaairlines.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-10 11:00:32.127329

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm that manages approximately $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.

What's happening

On Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company.

Behind the scenes

Lululemon is a global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company, offering pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for activities such as yoga, running and training. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. The problem here lies in North America. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors.

The root challenges in the North America business can be traced back to 2018, when Calvin McDonald became Lululemon CEO. From the beginning of his tenure, and through the post-Covid period, the company operated in a golden era for athleisure, benefiting from the broad casualization of apparel and enjoying years of outsized growth as the only real large-scale player. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. First, Lululemon used much of these earnings to pursue new business lines, including its $500 million acquisition of Mirror, as well as the launches of footwear and skincare lines, none of which have generated meaningful shareholder value. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. This is a dynamic that is evident to anybody who shops in the category. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026.

This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. Lululemon is still a quality product and brand that has somewhat lost its way and needs to be invigorated. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. When Nielsen joined Ralph Lauren in September 2016, sales had stalled and net income had fallen approximately 50% since 2014. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, ""The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing"" — which is similar to Lululemon today. Nielsen and the leadership team targeted millennial and Gen Z shoppers and overhauled the website and closed stores, leading to an increase of 20% in adjusted operating income.

When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. Elliott is not saying that Jane Nielsen is the best person for the job. The firm is saying that she is the best person it knows of for the job, and the firm does extensive and comprehensive diligence and analysis before making a recommendation like this. Elliott cannot name the next CEO. The board does that. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. But Elliott's presence alone adds a lot of value to the situation which the board should recognize. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. Without the activist, even a competent and experienced board could compromise on the CEO selection to appease the vocal founder.

This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Elliott's presence justified the urgency required and its endorsement of Niccol gave the board the external credibility to act quickly.

Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting.

L'Oréal S.A. vs.
So, is L'Oréal S.A. actually worth the hype – for your shelf and your portfolio?","The internet is losing it over L'Oréal S.A. – from skin cycling TikToks to celeb collabs – but here’s the question you actually care about: is this beauty giant still a must-have for your money, or just legacy hype?

The Hype is Real: L'Oréal S.A. on TikTok and Beyond

L'Oréal isn’t just sitting on drugstore shelves anymore – it’s living on your For You Page.

DermTok loves the ingredients. MakeupTok loves the finishes. And your feed loves the aesthetics. This is one of those brands that quietly shows up in every “get ready with me,” “what I actually use,” and “my updated routine” video.

Why that matters: for beauty, clout is currency. If products keep going viral, shelves empty out, and that helps the business behind the scenes – aka the Loreal Aktie with ISIN FR0000120321.

Watch honest tests on YouTube

Social sentiment right now? Very much “this is what I actually buy with my own money” energy. You keep seeing the same hits: Infallible base products, Telescopic and Lash Paradise mascaras, skin-care from CeraVe-adjacent brands under the L'Oréal umbrella, plus premium names like Lancôme and YSL Beauty for splurges.

Is everything a game-changer? No. But L'Oréal keeps landing enough viral bangers that beauty creators keep it in rotation. That constant relevance is a big deal.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Here’s the breakdown – the three biggest reasons L'Oréal is still in the chat.

1. Viral pipeline: mass to luxury

L'Oréal isn’t one brand, it’s a whole beauty universe. You’ve got drugstore staples (L'Oréal Paris, Maybelline, NYX), derm brands, and luxury labels like Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent Beauty, and Valentino Beauty.

What that means for you: they literally touch every budget and every vibe. When a new trend hits – skin tint, blurring powder, lip oil, bond-repair haircare – at least one of their brands is ready to jump on it. That’s why you keep seeing new “I didn’t expect to love this” videos with their products.

2. Algorithm-friendly price point

L'Oréal’s hero products usually sit in that sweet spot: not cheap junk, not luxury pain. Think drugstore prices that still look luxe on camera.

Real talk: On social, products that are way too expensive get “dupe-hunted.” Products that are too cheap get side-eyed. L'Oréal lives in that “okay, I’ll actually buy this” zone. That’s why you see lines outside stores after a review blows up, not just comments saying, “looks nice, but I’m broke.”

3. Trend-chasing that mostly lands

Bond-building haircare? They have it. Glass-skin primers? They have that vibe. Transfer-proof lip color, skin tints, skin-barrier-friendly routines – L'Oréal’s brands are fast at copying, remixing, and sometimes improving what’s already viral.

Is everything a game-changer? No. But because they move quickly, they get first-mover clout in drugstores and big-box chains. For you, that means: you can actually walk into a store and buy the thing you just saw online without hunting niche sites.

L'Oréal S.A. vs. The Competition

So where does L'Oréal stand in the beauty clout war?

The main rival in the global beauty arena is Estée Lauder – think MAC, Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, Too Faced, and more.

Social clout battle

L'Oréal: Huge presence in drugstores, supermarkets, and online. Strong on TikTok with products at reachable prices. Tons of mid-range and luxury brands that are creator favorites.

Estée Lauder: Big in prestige and department stores. Strong in skincare and high-end makeup, but less omnipresent in everyday “I grabbed this at Target” videos.

For Gen Z and younger millennials, L'Oréal wins because it’s everywhere you actually shop. You see it in Walmart, Target, Ulta, CVS, Walgreens, Sephora (for some lines), and all over Amazon and online retailers.

Innovation vs. aspiration

Estée Lauder leans hard into luxury and “treatment” messaging. L'Oréal leans into tech, labs, and affordability-crossing-into-premium. With AI skin analysis apps, shade matching, and science-forward branding on derm lines, L'Oréal feels closer to the “smart beauty” narrative that plays well on social right now.

Winner for clout? Based on reach, virality, and how often its brands pop up in “best of the drugstore” and “luxury vs affordable” videos, L'Oréal S.A. edges out Estée Lauder for the current hype cycle.

The Business Side: Loreal Aktie

Now the money question: what’s going on with the Loreal Aktie (ISIN FR0000120321) behind all this buzz?

Real talk on data: live stock quotes and exact prices change constantly and depend on your time zone and trading venue. At the time this was written, the markets were not actively trading, so only the latest available last close information can be used. You should always check a live source like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or Reuters before making any moves.

Across major finance platforms, the picture is consistent: L'Oréal is treated as a premium, large-cap beauty stock with a long record, not a meme rocket. Think steady compounder energy, not lottery ticket.

How the price usually behaves

It tends to move with global consumer trends: when people are spending on beauty, it benefits.

It’s globally diversified: sales are spread across regions, which helps smooth out local slowdowns.

It’s not cheap: high-quality, global brands like this often trade at a premium to the overall market.

Is it a no-brainer at the current price?

That’s where it gets nuanced. L'Oréal looks strong as a business and brand, but the stock is often priced like everyone already knows that. If you’re expecting meme-level upside overnight, this is probably not your play.

If you care about potential long-term stability over pure hype, L'Oréal can make more sense. But again: no guessing. Always pull up a live chart, look at the latest close, and compare it with analyst commentary before you decide anything.

For reference, search ""OR.PA"" or ""LOR.PA"" on a site like Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg, confirm you’re looking at ISIN FR0000120321, and check the latest price, percentage change, and one-year chart.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is L'Oréal S.A. actually worth the hype – for your shelf and your portfolio?

As a brand in your routine: this is mostly a cop.

You get products that show up again and again in viral reviews.

Prices that don’t totally wreck your budget.

A huge range across drugstore, mid, and luxury, so you can mix and match.

Not every launch is a game-changer, but there are enough hits that L'Oréal basically always has at least one product you’ll keep repurchasing.

As a stock (Loreal Aktie): this is more of a slow-burn maybe, not a hype-chasing must-cop.

If you like big, established brands with global reach, it checks that box.

If you want “to the moon” energy, this is likely too mature and too widely owned.

The price often bakes in a lot of optimism, so you need to be picky about entry points.

Real talk: for most people, L'Oréal makes more sense as the brand on your bathroom counter than as the core of some high-risk trading strategy. But if you’re into long-term, blue-chip-style beauty exposure, the Loreal Aktie with ISIN FR0000120321 is worth putting on your watchlist and checking whenever the market serves up a discount or a temporary price drop.

It positioned “personal fulfilment” as a central driver of future business growth. Instead of focusing on a single category, HP refreshed its entire portfolio at the show. This included business laptops, consumer PCs, printers, peripherals, and software, all aligned around AI acceleration, mobility, and human-centric design.

Availability and programs

HP plans to roll out its new OmniBook, OmniStudio, EliteBook, and Chromebook models throughout 2026. Most consumer models will begin shipping in early 2026, with enterprise systems following later in the year, depending on region and configuration.

HP also announced that its Future of Work Accelerator will return in 2026. The program will support organisations working on AI and workforce innovation applications open on January 12, with a February 6 deadline.

New devices focus on AI performance and portability

Kicking things off with the EliteBoard G1a, the world’s first full AI PC built into a keyboard. HP designed it for users who need portable computing power that moves easily between locations. The device won a CES 2026 Innovation Award.

HP also launched the EliteBook X G2 Series, its next-generation premium business laptops. These systems feature up to 85 TOPS of NPU performance when paired with Snapdragon X2 Elite processors. HP positions them as high-end AI work machines for professionals.

On the consumer side, the brand refreshed the entire OmniBook lineup. This includes the new OmniBook Ultra 14 and updated OmniBook 3, 5, 7, and X series models. Brand now offers OLED displays and AI-ready processors across the range. As per the claims, the OmniBook 3 16 delivers the longest battery life in a 16-inch OLED consumer laptop.

Alongside this, HP also introduced the new OmniStudio X all-in-one PCs. HP appears to be positioning this specifically for creators and home professionals. Basically, users who value screen size and colour accuracy as much as everyday multitasking power.

HP expanded AI beyond laptops and desktops.

The company integrated Microsoft Copilot directly into HP Office printers for the first time. This will allow users to summarise documents, translate content, and organise files directly at the printer.

HP also upgraded its Workforce Experience Platform (WXP). It added firmware-level recovery tools that allow IT teams to fix devices remotely, even when systems fail to boot. Brand says this helps reduce downtime in hybrid and distributed work environments.

Furthermore, there’s also HP Digital Passport, a new platform that gives users access to device information, sustainability data, setup tools, and support in one place. This product also received a CES Innovation Award.

HP unifies gaming under HyperX and launches a new flagship laptop

HP announced that it is unifying its OMEN and HyperX brands under a single master gaming brand called HyperX. As part of that shift, HP unveiled the HyperX OMEN MAX 16. They call it the world’s most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling. The company designed it for extreme performance, AI-driven tuning, and high-speed input.

HP says this move simplifies its gaming portfolio and creates a more consistent identity across gaming hardware, accessories, and software.

HP also refreshes peripherals and accessories

Last but not least, we also got to see some new peripherals designed for modern hybrid work. These include a compact 65W USB-C GaN charger, new ergonomic mice, protective laptop sleeves, and other workspace accessories. HP focused on portability, sustainability, and everyday usability.

HP’s strategy stands out for its breadth. It focuses less on a single flagship product. While Lenovo, ASUS, Dell, and Apple are also pushing AI and hybrid PCs, HP is trying to differentiate through ecosystem integration. That integration spans hardware, software, and services.

The EliteBoard G1a shows a willingness to rethink form factors. Meanwhile, Copilot at the printer and Digital Passport suggest that AI is becoming infrastructure, not just a feature. Whether this approach truly matters will depend on how much it improves everyday workflows.

HP’s announcements reflect a broader shift in the PC market. The company no longer treats business, consumer, creative, and gaming devices as strictly separate categories.

Whether this approach resonates will depend on how useful these AI features prove in everyday work. It will also depend on real-world performance, thermals, and battery life outside demo environments.",https://static.hub.91mobiles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/01/Hp-G1a-feat-1.png?tr=q-70,N,,2026-01-10 12:03:06.815663

Designed to work best with the iPhone 15 through iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max models, it is adaptable to other Android phones as well, so long as they fit snugly.

It’s getting easier to create content now, and should continue to be as we see more tech like this evolve.","CES is often a show that sees media capturing content all the time, especially when it comes to the tools of the trade unveiled there. The devices falling under this category vary widely, from drones to gimbals and on to unique cameras that can do things in ways others can’t.

Without further ado, here are some of the devices that stood out on the show floor.

Antigravity A1

This drone caused a stir at its booth during the show for the simple fact it has more than one way to fly it. Its main purpose is the ability to record 360-degree aerial footage in 8K, basically seeing everything all around it instead of only in one direction. That does make it a purely 360 camera, as there’s no way to switch to 180-degree shots but there are ways to reframe footage later when editing in post-production. Weighing roughly 249 grams, you don’t need to register it to fly in Canada, though rules still apply.

The A1 also enables a more immersive approach to piloting, pairing it with dedicated Vision goggles and a motion-based Grip controller that replaces traditional joysticks with gesture-driven control. This way, you can view a live 360-degree feed while flying, making it a fascinating first-person where you can see the drone’s view all around while it hovers in place. Combined with automated flight modes, safety systems like return-to-home, and streamlined editing tools for reframing and exporting footage, the A1 is aimed squarely at creators looking to push aerial video beyond conventional drone cinematography.

HoverAir AQUA

From the air to the sea, the HoverAir AQUA feels ambitious in what it’s attempting to do but I’m not aware of a drone that does it quite like this. While you can’t submerge this waterproof drone underwater and search for lost treasure, you can pilot it on the surface to capture watersports or point the camera down 90-degrees and see everything below—kind of like snorkeling. It can float, take off, and land directly on water, making it versatile enough for kayakers, paddleboarders, surfers, or anyone with an adventurous streak.

Weighing under 249 grams keeps it clear of most flight regulations, it can record 4K video up to 100 frames per second in wet and dry conditions. There are also 15 autonomous flight modes, including follow, orbit, snorkel, and mount options for hands-free filming. You control it through a Lighthouse accessory on your wrist, which functions as both a remote and a tracking beacon, enabling “follow-me” filming and simple one-tap commands for takeoff, landing, and mode switching without needing a phone.

Insta360 GO Ultra

While not entirely brand new, the GO Ultra action camera is easy to like when you first see it because it feels so adaptable. My personal favourite is the way it mounts through clothing via a lanyard and pendant you wear underneath, while a strong magnet attaches the camera to keep it in place. It comes with mount to do that, since the lanyard/pendant is a separate accessory but there are various ways to deploy this. Being a magnet, you can also pretty much attach it to any magnetic surface.

Add the optional Action Pod accessory and its 2.5-inch flip touchscreen, and you can remotely control it or get a live view of what it sees. It records in 4K at 60fps with a very wide 156-degree field of view, advanced stabilization, and AI-driven noise reduction. It also supports microSD cards up to 2TB. IPX8 waterproofing also enables it to capture footage underwater, making it a versatile little camera to take on any trip.

ShiftCam ProRig

ShiftCam’s ProRig can turn a smartphone into a more capable filmmaking rig by adding physical control and mounting options around the device. Designed to work best with the iPhone 15 through iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max models, it is adaptable to other Android phones as well, so long as they fit snugly. It includes multiple cold shoes, tripod mounts, and a slide-lock design that exposes USB-C ports, while also keeping the phone’s back open to attach MagSafe accessories.

There’s a detachable Bluetooth shutter remote that clips off on either side or works independently for some freedom in placement. ProRig supports ShiftCam’s own S-mount lenses and lets you integrate external microphones, lights, and other accessories to put together the best setup for you. For extra storage, you can also check out ShiftCam’s Planck SSD drives that are great for recording in Apple ProRes RAW.

Hohem MT3 and SSD-01

The Hohem iSteady MT3 Pro and SSD-01 mark two key devices in a broader creator-focused ecosystem. The MT3 Pro is a camera gimbal with top-end stabilization, while the SSD-01 provides high-speed storage for phones when recording video. The MT3 Series gimbals offer advanced AI tracking, smoother motion control, and support for heavier camera gear, with the Pro variant standing out more because of the detachable touchscreen remote. Clip it off and you have a live monitor and remote control all in one.

The ultra-compact SSD-01 delivers fast transfer speeds up to 2,000 MB/s read and 1,800 MB/s write, with capacities of 1TB and 2TB available. It supports Apple ProRes RAW and Open Gate recording from iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max, though works perfectly fine on iOS, Android, macOS and Windows. It even functions as a multi-port hub with mic receiver and fast-charging capabilities when you need both stabilization and storage.

XbotGo Falcon

The XbotGo Falcon is a hands-free AI sports camera that aims to give parents, coaches, and fans broadcast-style game footage without manual filming or subscriptions. Using computer vision and sport-specific AI models, it automatically pans, tilts, zooms, and tracks gameplay across more than 10 sports, with options to follow overall action or lock onto individual players by jersey number. Compact and tripod-mounted, it relies on a wide-angle lens with digital zoom, dual “AI Eyes,” and up to three hours of battery life, focusing entirely on video rather than still photos.

The idea is simple: set it up, hit record, and let the AI act as a virtual cameraman. You can store footage locally via microSD or in the cloud, and even livestream games on YouTube and Facebook. It can do all this with hockey, basketball, football, rugby—especially any sport with lateral play. Baseball is toughter, though XbotGo says it has a solution for that. Post-game, the AI tools can identify highlights and assist with editing, though full automation currently works best for basketball.

Wacom MovinkPad

Wacom’s MovinkPads are a new line of standalone creative tablets aimed at digital artists and creators who want a portable, all-in-one drawing experience without needing a computer. The most accessible is the MovinkPad 11, an Android-based tablet with an 11.45-inch display and Wacom’s Pro Pen 3, designed to let users sketch, paint, and work on ideas with very little setup. It includes sketching tools like Wacom Canvas and Clip Studio Paint DEBUT, and its textured glass surface and responsive pen aim to deliver a natural, paper-like feel that feels a little more real.

The MovinkPad Pro 14 expands the concept into a larger space with a 14-inch OLED display, rich colour coverage, and up to 120 Hz refresh rate. Features like Quick Drawing for instant capture and Instant Pen Display mode(in beta)—let the tablet function as a wireless or wired pen display for a PC or Mac.

Shure MV88

Shure’s MV88 USB-C Stereo Microphone is a compact, plug-and-play microphone you can pretty much use anywhere to capture high-quality sound straight from a phone, tablet, or laptop. The original MV88 had a Lightning connector, but this USB-C version natively supports Android, iOS, and other USB-C devices without adapters, letting you plug in and record right away without pairing or charging hassles. The microphone itself is a stereo condenser with four selectable polar patterns: adjustable stereo, mono cardioid, mono bi-directional, and raw mid-side.

I’ve used it on the show floor and it’s been great. I also like that it tilts to aim directly at sound sources and includes features like Auto Level Mode and Real-time Denoiser to help maintain clear, balanced audio in varied environments. Shures MOTIV app also lets you customize controls for microphone gain, five-band EQ, compression, limiter, and a high-pass filter to fine-tune what you want to hear.

Lexar Portable SSDs

Lexar’s latest portable SSDs include the Air Portable SSD and SL500 drives, which will come in limited edition versions co-branded with the Argentina National Football Team and display team colours, including the name and number of legend, Lionel Messi. These special editions bring the same portability and performance as the base models but with a collector’s twist for football fans and creators alike. They’ll come in capacities of 512GB, 2TB, and 4TB.

Ready to roll

Revvity (RVTY) just announced a collaboration with Eli Lilly that puts Lilly’s TuneLab AI and machine learning models inside the Revvity Signals platform, directly tying the stock story to AI-enabled drug discovery workflows.

The move builds on Revvity’s Signals Xynthetica and Models-as-a-Service offerings. It gives biotech customers a way to apply Lilly’s predictive models to their own data while keeping proprietary information protected through a federated learning setup.

Investors appear to be responding to the Lilly announcement, with a 1 day share price return of 2.67% and a 90 day share price return of 18.28% taking Revvity to US$104.43. However, the 1 year total shareholder return is still negative at 8.04%, and longer term total shareholder returns over three and five years also remain negative, so recent momentum is building from a weaker base.

If this AI push has your attention, it could be a good moment to widen your watchlist and see how other healthcare names stack up using .

With Revvity trading at US$104.43, an implied intrinsic discount of about 19% and a roughly 10% gap to analyst targets, is AI-driven optimism already captured in the price, or is the market underestimating future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 8.7% Undervalued

Compared with Revvity’s last close at US$104.43, the most followed narrative points to a slightly higher fair value, built on earnings and margin assumptions.

“Fair Value: risen slightly from approximately $113.67 to $114.38 per share, implying a modest increase in intrinsic value.

Discount Rate: increased marginally from about 8.41% to 8.43%, reflecting a slightly higher required return on equity.”

Want to see what is behind that valuation gap? The narrative leans on steady revenue expansion, wider margins and a future earnings multiple that is expected to compress over time. Curious which specific profit and growth paths are used to justify that outcome, and how buybacks are woven into the math?

Result: Fair Value of $114.38 (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh ongoing China reimbursement pressures and softer academic and government funding, which could challenge margins and the AI-driven growth story.

Another angle on valuation

The Simply Wall St DCF model already flags Revvity as trading about 18.5% below its fair value estimate, which points to an undervalued signal alongside the 8.7% discount implied by the popular narrative. When both story and spreadsheet line up like that, it raises a simple question: what might both be missing?

The company's stock faced selling pressure in the latest session, closing lower as the market digested a notable change in its investor registry.

A key development emerged from a mandatory voting rights disclosure filed yesterday. AXA Investment Managers UK Limited reported crossing a relevant notification threshold as of January 1st. The investment firm now holds a 3.88% stake in Vulcan Energy, equivalent to 18,561,143 voting shares out of a total of 477,870,976.

This represents an increase from a previously disclosed holding of 3.37%. The shift is not the result of new market purchases but stems from an internal corporate transaction. Following the acquisition of AXA Investment Managers by the BNP Paribas group, a consolidation of assets under the BNP Paribas umbrella necessitated a recalculation and fresh declaration of the voting rights. This integration provides greater transparency regarding the distribution of influence among Vulcan's major shareholders.

Market Performance and Valuation Metrics

The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) witnessed a negative reaction to the news. Vulcan Energy shares closed the trading day at AUD 4.635, marking a single-day decline of 3.44%. At this price level, the company commands a market capitalization of approximately AUD 2.215 billion.

Year-to-date, the equity has traded within a range of AUD 2.811 to AUD 6.292. The current price situates the stock near the midpoint of this 52-week band, suggesting a period of consolidation after earlier volatility.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Vulcan Energy?

Key Market Data Summary:

* Last Price: AUD 4.635

* Daily Change: -3.44%

* Total Voting Rights: 477,870,976

* AXA/BNP Paribas Holding: 18,561,143 shares (3.88%)

* Market Capitalization: ~AUD 2.215 billion

Progress on Major Project Financing

Parallel to the shareholder update, the company is making concrete strides in securing its financial foundation. Development finance institutions (DFIs) and export credit agencies (ECAs) are reportedly coordinating efforts to fund critical raw material projects across Europe. Within this framework, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is taking on an anchor role in a financing consortium that includes Vulcan Energy.

This builds upon steps confirmed back in December 2025, when Vulcan secured a conditional debt commitment of roughly USD 922 million (EUR 879 million) for its Lionheart project in Germany. The involvement of supranational institutions like the EIB forms a cornerstone of the company's capital strategy, designed to underwrite its planned carbon-neutral lithium production operations.

Trading Sentiment and Technical Perspective

Trading activity on the ASX indicated heightened investor interest. On popular forums such as HotCopper, the primary discussion thread for Vulcan Energy recorded a noticeable surge in views and comments. This spike in social engagement coincided with the ownership structure announcements, highlighting market attention on the implications of the BNP Paribas integration via the AXA takeover.

From a chart analysis standpoint, short-term focus shifts to a support level around AUD 4.60. The recent pullback raises questions about whether this zone will hold or if the share price will gravitate toward the lower end of its yearly range. The interplay between a clarified ownership structure and tangible progress in deploying the committed project financing is likely to be the decisive factor for future price direction.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2428120_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 07:59:01.157503

What Stripe’s move underscores is that the future of stablecoins is not about convincing people to care about blockchains.

“There are 30 million creators, and they’re in all these markets where the local currency isn’t really strong,” he said.","What that pitch can leave out, however, is everything that makes money usable at scale. That includes compliance, consumer protection, liquidity management, accounting standards and integration with existing payment rails.

But that gap is now closing, and some of the most telling developments this week came from the banking sector itself.

On Wednesday (Jan. 7), Digital Asset and Kinexys by J.P. Morgan announced a collaboration bringing Kinexys by J.P. Morgan’s products to Digital Asset’s Canton Network, a privacy-enabled blockchain network designed for synchronized financial markets. Also Wednesday, Barclays announced it purchased a stake in Ubyx, a U.S. stablecoin settlement company.

Capping it all off, PYMNTS and Citigroup announced the launch of a weekly podcast series aimed at giving corporate leaders practical guidance on stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Called “From the Block: Straight Talk on Stablecoins and Digital Assets for Corporate Leaders,” the show will be co-hosted by PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster and Citi Global Head of Digital Assets, Treasury and Trade Solutions Ryan Rugg. The first episode will debut Tuesday (Jan. 13).

Stablecoins Move From Speculative Asset to Settlement Primitive

At the consumer and merchant level, the digital asset shift is even more striking because it is being framed as anything but cryptocurrency.

This week, Stripe expanded its crypto payment capabilities, enabling millions of merchants to accept blockchain-based payments with minimal friction. From a user experience perspective, little changes. Customers still click “pay.” Merchants still receive funds they can spend or convert. But under the hood, the rails are different.

What Stripe’s move underscores is that the future of stablecoins is not about convincing people to care about blockchains. It is about abstracting them away.

In the same vein, the stablecoin company Rain announced Friday (Jan. 9) that it raised $250 million in a Series C funding round to scale its infrastructure for stablecoin payments and add new capabilities and products.

Rain’s platform enables companies to launch compliant stablecoin cards that work everywhere Visa is accepted, offer rewards, convert fiat into stablecoins, power secure wallets and facilitate payouts.

Stablecoins may prove to be the most transformative chapter in digital payments because they merge money movement and reconciliation into a single digital packet, Rain CEO and co-founder Farooq Malik told PYMNTS in an interview posted in September.

It’s “the holy grail of money since the beginning of time,” Malik said.

Total stablecoin transaction volumes topped out at $33 trillion in 2025, Bloomberg reported Thursday (Jan. 8), citing data from Artemis Analytics.

What It Means for the Future of Money

Perhaps the most underappreciated stablecoin story this week came from creator platforms. Rumble announced Wednesday a partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether to enable audiences to tip creators natively in the Tether stablecoin (USDT), Tether Gold (XAUt) and Bitcoin (BTC).

Mark Nelsen, head of product for Visa Commercial Money Solutions, discussed this topic during a November interview with PYMNTS.

“There are 30 million creators, and they’re in all these markets where the local currency isn’t really strong,” he said. “That’s where stablecoins can offer a sweet spot in being able to say, ‘We can pay you immediately.’”

YouTube has also begun letting creators on its platform get paid in PayPal’s stablecoin.

Outside of the creator economy, U.S. states are also getting into the stablecoin issuance arena. On Wednesday, the state of Wyoming officially launched the Frontier Stable Token ($FRNT).

Earlier this year, PYMNTS interviewed two of the executives involved in the project, Rain’s Malik and Morgan Krupetsky, vice president of on-chain finance at Ava Labs.

“This is a different category of token that we haven’t seen before,” Malik said. “And it has a lot of really interesting opportunities for the state to embed itself into how money moves.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stablecoins.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 15:00:10.861700

Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.
He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in—even those junior ones.","But Stephanie Kramer, the CHRO of L’Oréal U.S., says those small tasks are often where opportunity begins—and they played a surprisingly big role in her own career to the corner office at the world’s largest beauty company.

Quest fragrances, where she worked closely with perfumers early in her career

Before joining the Fortune 500 firm, L’Oreal, Kramer’s first job out of university was at Quest fragrances. It was also the first time the value of a simple coffee run stood out.

“I really wanted to have time to get to meet this incredibly cool perfumer,” she recalls to Fortune, adding that she went early to the meeting with the mindset that she simply wanted to support her team. But she soon discovered that “something positive comes out of those little things too.”

Instead of being wrapped up in being seen as the most junior person in the room, she quickly noted it gets you access.

“If you’re the one that is going to capture the actions from the meeting and the next steps, and you’re listening and you’re observing that isn’t that isn’t necessarily a negative,” Kramer explains. “You are in the room and you are absorbing how those points are coming to be. You’re developing the skills of inference.”

“So just make sure, when you’re discrediting some of those more small tasks, that you’re not discrediting their value they bring to you and your learning. I think about that all the time.”

Take whatever you can now, be strategic later

Kramer’s résumé spans Chanel, Kiehl’s, and L’Oréal’s corner offices—but it’s the middle-school roles and the odd, early-career errands she remembers most clearly.

“Those ones stick with you,” she says. That first job probably won’t be your dream role, it certainly wasn’t hers. But over time, it will have a snowball effect on your career.

“I don’t know if those are the ones where I ever wanted to be, you know, in my whole life.” Yet, she insists, every experience adds up. “It does. It makes a big difference.”

Her message to young workers facing a freezing job market: take the role, take the task, take the coffee run—because the value will only compound over time.

“You just have to start,” Kramer insists. “I guarantee that someday, that’s what you’re going to talk about in your interview.”

“It might not be the job that you have, or that you’re not necessarily sure that you should take. Right now, maybe it’s a paycheck, or maybe it’s a platform for you to connect with other people so that you can discover what you want to do.”

“When people ask me how I ended up in HR, I tell them it’s from middle school, because in middle school I was a lifeguard, I was a Girl Scout, I was a cross country runner, which means that you have to run through the woods alone, but you’re still making points as a team….Those jobs are part of what my job is today.”

The promotions will come later—but first, focus on

As the adage goes: If you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves. The same goes for your career. Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.

Cisco’s U.K. chief spent 25 years climbing the ranks at the Fortune 500 Europe telecommunications giant BT, before joining Cisco in 2022 as managing director and being promoted lead its U.K. and Ireland arm just two years later.

She previously told Fortune that both Gen Z new hires and millennial middle managers need to be more “patient” in their quest for success. The promotions will come, but young aspirational workers should focus on building their skills over rushing to nab any new snazzy title to update their LinkedIn.

Pret A Manger’s CEO Pano Christou, went from working at McDonald’s for $3 an hour to earning millions as the boss of the British sandwich chain. He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in—even those junior ones.

“I’ve watched people that have been so fixated on the next role that they really take their eye off the current job they’re doing,” Christou told Fortune. “My philosophy has always been if you do a great job, people will notice you.”

Likewise, Shaid Shah, one of the most senior execs at Mars—the powerhouse behind household brands like Dolmio—said the best career hack is to stop obsessing over getting that promotion or dream job title, and embrace the many steps in between that get you there.

“It’s about acquiring the experiences that you need to realize your ambition, to realize what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what inspires you to get out of bed every day,” Shah explained. “Because career success is more than just hierarchy.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2025968628-e1764771331336.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-10 06:58:53.218262

Pest control is one of those unsexy, indispensable services that rarely makes headlines—until it fails. Termites quietly eat through a support beam, rodents compromise a food plant audit, or a bed bug outbreak forces a hotel to shut down floors. In that moment, the only thing that matters is reliability and speed. That is precisely the space Rollins Inc. has spent decades productizing and scaling into a global, tech-enabled platform.

Under consumer and commercial brands like Orkin, Critter Control, Western Pest Services, Acuren, and others, Rollins Inc. has turned a highly localized, technician-heavy business into something that increasingly behaves like a standardized product: predictable, recurring, defensible. Its core offering isn’t a gadget or an app, but a tightly engineered service stack—inspection, treatment, monitoring, compliance reporting—delivered through a unified operational model and supported by software, data, and training.

Get all details on Rollins Inc. here

Inside the Flagship: Rollins Inc.

When investors and operators talk about Rollins Inc., they’re increasingly talking about the productization of pest control. Rollins’ flagship ""product"" is an integrated service ecosystem built primarily around its Orkin brand in North America and an expanding portfolio of local brands internationally. The value lies in how standardized, data-aware, and scalable that ecosystem has become.

At its core, Rollins Inc. delivers four tightly defined solution sets:

1. Residential pest protection as a subscription product

For homeowners, Rollins Inc. has effectively turned pest control into a home subscription layer. Customers typically sign up for annual or multi-year service plans with scheduled visits and on-demand callbacks. This is not marketed as a one-off extermination, but as an ongoing protection product—a subtle shift that dramatically improves retention and recurring revenue.

Key features often include:

Regular, scheduled exterior and interior inspections

Targeted treatments for ants, roaches, spiders, rodents and other region-specific pests

Digital reminders, service histories, and technician notes accessible through online portals or mobile communications

Premium add-ons such as mosquito-focused seasonal treatments or termite-specific coverage

The result is a predictable, productized service tier that feels closer to an insurance policy than a one-off contractor visit.

2. Termite and structural protection as an engineered solution

Termites are a high-ticket, high-risk problem, and Rollins Inc. has leaned into that with clearly framed termite protection products. These typically include in-depth inspections, installation of baiting or barrier systems, and long-term warranties or damage repair guarantees depending on jurisdiction.

What distinguishes Rollins Inc. here is the repeatable methodology: standardized protocols, technician training programs, and sophisticated scheduling and routing tools that keep utilization high and margins healthy, even in a labor-intensive segment.

3. Commercial and food safety programs as compliance infrastructure

For food processors, restaurants, logistics hubs, and retailers, pests are a regulatory and brand risk. Rollins Inc. has tailored its commercial pest control products to align with audit standards for organizations like AIB International, BRCGS, SQF, and other global food safety schemes.

That means the product is not just pest elimination, but:

Auditable documentation and digital service reports

Trend analytics showing where issues recur across large sites

Integration with HACCP-style risk management and preventive control plans

National account coordination for large chains and multi-site operators

This transforms pest control into a compliance and risk-management layer within a customer’s broader operational stack—a far more defensible and sticky product positioning.

4. Wildlife, specialty and international services as brand-led micro-products

Rollins Inc. has systematically acquired and integrated regional specialists, including wildlife removal brands and international pest-control firms. Each acquisition is folded into a shared backbone of systems and processes, but the customer-facing brands retain local equity.

That approach turns Rollins Inc. into a portfolio of highly targeted micro-products—bat and squirrel exclusion in one region, bird management in another, or bed bug control solutions tailored for hospitality clients—while still benefiting from centralized technology, procurement, and data practices.

The technology layer

Behind these offerings, Rollins Inc. has been investing in the less glamorous, but immensely powerful underpinnings: field service management software, routing and dispatch optimization, CRM and account management tools, and increasingly, digital monitoring. In commercial environments especially, IoT-connected traps and monitoring devices feed into dashboards and reports that offer customers continuous visibility rather than just visit-based snapshots.

It’s not a Silicon Valley SaaS story, but the strategic use of software and telemetry is exactly what turns a fragmented, low-tech industry into a scalable platform business.

Market Rivals: Rollins Inc. Aktie vs. The Competition

In the global pest control market, Rollins Inc. competes most directly with a handful of major players and scores of local and regional providers. The most relevant benchmark products come from Rentokil Initial and Ecolab.

Rentokil Initial’s Pest Control Services

Compared directly to Rentokil Initial’s Pest Control services, Rollins Inc. is essentially battling another global giant with a similarly diversified portfolio. Rentokil offers its own suite of products, especially in Europe and Asia, such as:

Integrated pest management solutions for food processing and hospitality

Digital pest control tools like remote monitoring units and connected traps

Specialized termite and mosquito control offerings in specific markets

Rentokil has been especially aggressive in rolling out digital solutions and has broader legacy strength in Europe. By contrast, Rollins Inc. dominates the North American landscape and has been expanding internationally via acquisition. While Rentokil tends to emphasize its digital and analytics stack in marketing, Rollins leans on the strength of the Orkin brand and deep penetration into U.S. commercial and residential accounts.

Ecolab Pest Elimination

Compared directly to Ecolab Pest Elimination, Rollins Inc. faces a competitor that embeds pest control within a larger ecosystem of hygiene, sanitation, and water treatment products. Ecolab’s proposition to hotels, restaurants, and food manufacturers often bundles pest elimination with cleaning chemicals, dishwashing systems, and other facility solutions.

Where Ecolab excels is in integrated facility management and chemistry-driven solutions—its pest elimination product is one node in a broader operational web. Rollins Inc., however, focuses far more intensely on pest control as a core competency, with Orkin and other brands built around technician expertise, route density, and risk management. That single-mindedness shows up in brand recognition: in North America especially, the Orkin name is more directly associated with pest control than Ecolab’s more diversified portfolio.

Local and regional specialists

At the ground level, Rollins Inc. still competes daily with independent operators—local exterminators, family-owned regional firms, and specialty wildlife control vendors. These players often compete on price and personal relationships. Rollins Inc. counters with standardized quality, robust guarantees, faster emergency response via dense routing networks, and the credibility of long-running consumer brands.

In effect, Rollins Inc.’s product is engineered to sit between the massive, diversified global service conglomerates and the hyper-local independent technician—big enough to deliver national contracts and digital reporting, focused enough to feel like a dedicated pest specialist.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Rollins Inc. does not win by dazzling with futuristic hardware. It wins through a combination of scale, standardization, and relentless focus on a single problem: keeping pests from undermining homes, businesses, and brands.

Several factors give Rollins Inc. a durable edge over its competition:

1. Brand as a trust shortcut

In an emergency—rodent sighting in a restaurant, termite swarm in a living room—customers default to recognizable names. Orkin, Rollins’ flagship consumer brand, has spent decades turning its logo and trucks into shorthand for ""this will be handled."" That brand equity acts like a trust fast lane in both residential and commercial markets, which is especially powerful in a low-information, high-stress buying decision.

2. Productized service with recurring revenue baked in

Rollins Inc. has systematically reframed pest control as an ongoing protection product rather than a reactive service call. Multi-visit packages, annual plans, and long-term termite and rodent programs turn what used to be episodic revenue into subscription-like flows. That not only stabilizes the business, it also makes the customer experience more predictable and proactive—problems are addressed before they become crises.

3. Operational efficiency as technology, not just labor

The pest-control industry historically depended on individual technicians’ knowledge and manual scheduling. Rollins Inc. layers route optimization, CRM integration, and data-driven planning on top of that labor, increasing visit density and reducing downtime. For commercial accounts, digital reporting and analytics have become integral to passing audits and maintaining certifications, embedding Rollins’ products deeper into clients’ operations.

4. Acquisition-led expansion with a common operating model

By acquiring local and regional pest-control firms and plugging them into a standardized operating framework, Rollins Inc. can quickly extend its reach without diluting product quality. Each acquisition effectively becomes a new distribution channel for the company’s productized service stack, strengthening national accounts and building international presence.

5. Recession-resistant, climate-impacted demand

Pest pressure doesn’t follow economic cycles; in many regions, climate change, urbanization, and global trade are actually increasing the complexity and frequency of infestations. That creates a steady, and in some cases growing, baseline of demand. Rollins Inc.’s product is less a discretionary purchase and more a form of risk insurance—particularly for food, healthcare, and hospitality customers.

Put together, these advantages mean that when customers compare Rollins Inc. to alternatives like Rentokil’s Pest Control or Ecolab Pest Elimination, they’re often choosing between a diversified service conglomerate and a deeply specialized, high-trust operator. For pure-play pest solutions, Rollins Inc. consistently comes out ahead, especially in North America.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Rollins Inc. Aktie (ISIN US7757111049) has benefited materially from the company’s ability to turn a fragmented service category into a predictable, recurring-revenue engine.

Using external financial data from sources including Yahoo Finance and another major market data provider, as of the latest available trading data retrieved via live search, Rollins Inc. Aktie is trading at a level that reflects its status as a defensive, cash-generative growth story. Because this information depends on real-time markets, intraday prices vary; where real-time quotes are not available, investors should refer to the most recent ""Last Close"" price reported by their broker or a trusted financial platform. The figures examined in research were current as of the latest market session timestamped on the day of analysis.

What matters more than the exact print is the trajectory. Investors have largely rewarded Rollins Inc. for three intertwined characteristics of its product strategy:

High recurring revenue: Residential and commercial contracts create multi-year visibility into cash flows.

Margin resilience: Standardized processes and route density preserve margins even as labor and fuel costs fluctuate.

Acquisition runway: The company’s ability to integrate local firms without eroding its product quality gives it a credible long-term consolidation thesis.

Every additional contract Rollins Inc. signs—whether a national restaurant chain, a logistics network, or a growing base of residential subscribers—behaves like another node in a steadily compounding network of recurring revenue. That model has historically translated into a valuation premium versus many traditional service businesses.

From a market-structure perspective, Rollins Inc.’s product positioning also acts as a hedge for investors. The company operates in a space that is both defensive (people and businesses cannot simply defer pest control indefinitely) and structurally supported by environmental and regulatory trends. As climate shifts alter pest behavior and regulators tighten food and health standards, the value of a reliable, standardized pest-control product only increases.

In that sense, Rollins Inc. Aktie is not just a bet on a single brand like Orkin, but on the continuing productization of risk mitigation in the built environment. The more the company leans into digital monitoring, analytics, and integrated compliance reporting, the more its offerings begin to resemble a critical infrastructure layer rather than a commodity service.

For customers, that means faster response, more transparent reporting, and less guesswork. For Rollins Inc., it means that every technician visit and every connected monitoring device is part of a larger, highly defensible product ecosystem—one that is increasingly reflected in the way the market values its stock.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404990_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:58:43.233509

Fuel prices represent another channel through which the Venezuela crisis is influencing airlines.
The brokerage said and WTI crude oil prices declined about 21% in 2025, contributing to lower fuel costs for carriers.
Jefferies said oil price movements tied to developments in Venezuela are closely watched by airlines because fuel remains one of their largest operating costs.
Jefferies said the initial effects are “largely focused on airlines” due to cancellations and oil price movements.","Investing.com -- The political and military crisis unfolding in Venezuela is already affecting global airlines through flight disruptions, airspace restrictions and changes in fuel price dynamics, according to a recent note by analysts at Jefferies.

The U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which included the capture of President Nicolas Maduro during a large-scale raid in Caracas, led to immediate aviation impacts across the Caribbean region.

Following the operation, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed temporary flight restrictions, prompting widespread cancellations. Hundreds of flights in the Caribbean were canceled, including more than 300 flights originating from or arriving in Puerto Rico, the brokerage said.

Air Lines said it began canceling Caribbean flights early Saturday to comply with FAA airspace closures, while disclosed that trips to Aruba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico were canceled or diverted.

The disruptions affect a region that contributes a meaningful share of passenger revenue for major U.S. carriers.

Jefferies said Latin America accounts for 13% of ’ 2025 passenger revenue, 10% for and 8% for Delta.

The cancellations and diversions linked to the Venezuela operation underscore how geopolitical instability in the region can directly interrupt airline schedules and revenue flows.

Fuel prices represent another channel through which the Venezuela crisis is influencing airlines. The brokerage said and WTI crude oil prices declined about 21% in 2025, contributing to lower fuel costs for carriers. Brent crude was trading at about $60 per barrel at the time of the report.

Venezuela holds about 303BB barrels of crude, the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but produces only about 1MM barrels per day, or roughly 0.8% of global crude output, due to sanctions, economic conditions and limited investment in infrastructure.

Jefferies said oil price movements tied to developments in Venezuela are closely watched by airlines because fuel remains one of their largest operating costs. For 2026, the brokerage assumes an average oil price of about $62.40 per barrel, compared with about $70.20 in 2025 and $81.20 in 2024.

The analysts said each 5% change in estimated average fuel cost per gallon in 2026 would have a material effect on airline earnings, ranging from about 5% to 10% for Delta, Southwest and United, and about 20% for American Airlines.

Beyond fuel and airspace restrictions, the crisis has added operational uncertainty across Caribbean and Latin American air routes.

The FAA restrictions and airline responses illustrate how military activity can quickly alter flight paths and schedules, even outside the immediate conflict zone. Jefferies said the initial effects are “largely focused on airlines” due to cancellations and oil price movements.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPECBE0OL_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:02:53.204197

Lilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category.
Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.
The project is part of Eli Lilly’s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing.

The final Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation Act tax agreement that lured the pharmaceutical giant to Houston was posted to the state comptroller’s website this week, the Houston Business Journal reported. The deal caps a fast-moving courtship that began less than a year ago, when Eli Lilly first applied for the incentive program and publicly disclosed its interest in the region.

The global drugmaker plans to build the massive facility on 236 acres within McCord Development’s Generation Park, a 4,300-acre master-planned industrial park off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport and the Port of Houston. The plant will manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients, including orforglipron, Lilly’s closely watched oral GLP-1 drug aimed at treating obesity.

The agreement offers a clearer look at the economics behind the splashy announcement.

Lilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category. The company said the plant will ultimately create more than 600 high-paying jobs, with an initial requirement of 75 jobs and $200 million in investment by the first year of the incentive period. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs for the duration of its buildout.

McCord Development will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings, as previously reported by The Real Deal.

To secure the deal, Sheldon Independent School District agreed to exempt the property from school taxes through 2030, then cap the taxable value at 50 percent for another decade. The district’s board signed off in November, and Gov. Greg Abbott’s office added its signature on Jan. 5, finalizing the agreement after a joint announcement with Lilly last fall.

The timing of construction remains murky. While the incentive paperwork lists a Sept. 1, 2025 construction start date, no visible signs of work existed following Abbott’s Sept. 23 announcement. Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.

The project is part of Eli Lilly’s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing. CEO David Ricks has pointed to permanently lowered federal corporate tax rates as a tailwind for “intellectual property-driven” businesses, though he has downplayed the role of state incentives alone. Houston beat out a “very competitive” runner-up, he said, thanks to workforce quality, available space and a collaborative local government culture.

Those factors are baked into Generation Park’s pitch. The development is home to San Jacinto College’s Center for Biotechnology, creating a direct training pipeline for pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs, with Sheldon ISD already feeding students into the program.

While Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than 700 life science companies making Houston home.

“In the age of AI, NVIDIA and Caterpillar are partnering across the full spectrum – from autonomous construction fleets to the AI data centres powering the next industrial revolution.”","Caterpillar and NVIDIA are expanding a collaboration to enhance manufacturing systems through physical AI.

The partnership focuses on deploying next-generation technology across construction, mining and power equipment used in factories around the world.

Joe Creed, CEO of Caterpillar, says: “As AI moves beyond data to reshape the physical world, it is unlocking new opportunities for innovation.

“Caterpillar is committed to solving our customers’ toughest challenges by leading with advanced technology in our machines and every aspect of business.”

Edge computing and autonomous machinery

Caterpillar says it is preparing its assets for an automated future by using the NVIDIA Jetson Thor platform to enable real-time processing. These hardware updates provide the foundation for autonomous operations and intelligent in-cab experiences.

The approach allows machines to process sensor data locally as a digital nervous system for worksites, reducing reliance on remote data centres. Machines equipped with these systems process billions of data points in milliseconds, Caterpillar says.

This capability supports equipment navigating variable jobsite conditions where latency can impact safety and productivity. By processing data at the edge, Caterpillar addresses connectivity in remote environments, helping autonomous fleets remain operational even in isolated mining or construction sites.

Generative AI for the industrial workforce

New in-cab features include an operator assistant that provides insights and safety alerts in real time.

The system offers coaching and productivity tips to help operators manage complex tasks with speed, directly addressing the growing skills gap in the industrial workforce.

At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, US, Caterpillar debuted the Cat AI Assistant. This proactive tool is embedded in digital products to help users take informed action using NVIDIA Riva speech models to provide lifelike voices and accurate recommendations on maintenance and parts.

Inside the cab, voice activation allows users to change settings and access troubleshooting guides. The tool relies on data stored on the Helios unified data platform.

Digital twins for resilient factory operations

Caterpillar is using an NVIDIA AI Factory to transform manufacturing and supply chain operations. This infrastructure helps create resilient production systems that are leaner and safer by automating processes such as forecasting and scheduling.

The company uses its manufacturing digital data platform to build physically accurate digital twins of its factories. These models use NVIDIA Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD to mirror real-world facilities with high precision.

They allow teams to design and optimise production layouts before building them in the real world, improving safety and efficiency during planning and expansion. By simulating factory workflows, Caterpillar can identify potential bottlenecks before they affect the physical supply chain.

Growth in industrial AI

The collaboration creates an ecosystem that touches jobsites, factories and supply chains globally. Caterpillar plans to launch an off-board version of the Cat AI Assistant in the first quarter of 2026 and increase research spending through 2030.

Jensen Huang, Founder and CEO of NVIDIA, says: “For a century, Caterpillar has built the industrial machines that shaped the world.

If Boston Scientific is on your radar for medical devices exposure, this could be a good moment to scan wider across healthcare stocks for other healthcare names showing similar interest and activity.

With Boston Scientific trading at US$97.64, a projected profit of US$0.78 per share, strong product demand and upbeat analyst targets, is there still a buying opportunity here or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 22.4% Undervalued

With Boston Scientific last closing at US$97.64 against a narrative fair value of about US$125.86, the story leans heavily on upbeat long term assumptions.

Over the longer term, bullish analysts see the company’s three year plan, centered on a broad slate of growth programs, as a credible roadmap for sustaining roughly 10% organic sales growth and above market EPS compounding.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what sits behind that confidence in steady double digit style growth and richer profit margins, and how it all feeds into a premium future P/E multiple and fair value north of US$120? The full narrative lays out the revenue runway, margin profile, and earnings power that need to line up for that outcome.

Result: Fair Value of $125.86 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, you also need to factor in risks, including tariff related cost pressure and intense competition, which could squeeze margins or challenge the premium P/E narrative.

Find out about the key risks to this Boston Scientific narrative.

Another View: Rich P/E Puts Pressure On The Story

That 22.4% narrative undervaluation sits against a very different message from plain P/E math. Boston Scientific trades on a P/E of 51.9x, compared with 31.3x for the US Medical Equipment industry and 41.4x for peers, and above a fair ratio of 41.3x.

In simple terms, the share price already assumes stronger execution than both the sector and similar companies. It is also above the level our fair ratio suggests the market could move toward over time. The question for you is whether the growth and margins outlined in the narrative truly justify paying that kind of premium.

At a share price of US$267.21, Lowe's has seen momentum build recently, with a 1 day share price return of 4.29% and a 90 day share price return of 15.07%. The 5 year total shareholder return of 70.99% points to meaningful long term value creation.

If this upgrade has you thinking beyond a single retailer, it could be a good moment to scan for other companies catching investor interest.

So with Lowe's trading close to Barclays’ new price target and recent returns already strong, is the upgrade flagging an undervalued home improvement heavyweight, or are markets already pricing in the next leg of growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 2% Undervalued

With Lowe's last closing at US$267.21 against a narrative fair value of about US$273.22, the valuation story hinges on how future earnings and margins evolve.

Ongoing pent up demand from delayed home improvement projects, combined with record high aging U.S. housing stock and an estimated 18 million new homes needed by 2033, points to a significant runway for future growth in renovation, repair, and new construction; this is expected to positively affect revenue and support sustained top line expansion as the housing cycle recovers.

Want to see what is baked into that price tag? The narrative leans heavily on modest revenue growth, firmer profit margins, and a richer earnings multiple. Curious how those moving parts add up to the fair value shown above?

Result: Fair Value of $273.22 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could change if acquisitions fail to integrate smoothly or if a flat home improvement market leaves those revenue and margin assumptions looking overly optimistic.

Behind the scenes, workers are dealing with the reality of aging systems, siloed data and rising customer expectations — a combination that makes consistency and speed harder to deliver with every new season and added stock-keeping unit (SKU).

New Multi-Agent Intelligent Warehouse (MAIW) and Retail Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprints are designed to turn this dynamic system into an advantage. These open-source developer references, launched today, empower developers to customize AI-powered solutions for the retail value chain, from warehouse to wardrobes.

“Building with these blueprints will reduce the cost of integration and help our customers and partners enable applications fast,” said Tarik Hammadou, director of developer relations for AI for retail and consumer packaged goods at NVIDIA. “They unlock the efficiency and enterprise‑grade scale the retail industry needs to compete.”

The blueprints will be showcased next week at the National Retail Federation: Retail’s Big Show.

Easing Warehouse Workflows

Warehouses are dynamic spaces with many moving parts, from boxes carrying a variety of retail goods to massive machines and workers fulfilling thousands of daily orders. Issues can arise in an instant — from out-of-stock items to cleanups needed in aisle four.

An ongoing issue within this workspace is a disconnect between the IT and operational technology (OT) layers. This gap bars managers from easily handling problems such as accurately measuring product inventory, efficiently pinpointing technology issues and deploying enough workers to areas that need extra help.

“The idea of having an agentic AI layer on the IT or OT level is not efficient, but having agents in between IT and OT allows the AI agents to act as the coordinators,” said Hammadou.

The NVIDIA MAIW blueprint delivers a synchronized AI system that sits above existing warehouse management systems, enterprise resource planning, robotics and IoT data, so teams gain real-time, explainable operational intelligence.

The blueprint comprises specialized agents for equipment asset operations, operations coordination, safety compliance, forecasting and document processing — all orchestrated by a central warehouse operational assistant that mirrors how warehouses actually run and turns fragmented data into proactive decision-making.

For example, a supervisor can ask in natural language, “Why is packing slow?” and the assistant analyzes equipment status, tasks queues and staffing data to highlight the bottleneck, shows the supporting evidence and recommends actions such as rebalancing work or adjusting task priorities.

The blueprint also provides production-grade capabilities — including role-based access control and guardrails to keep recommendations within policy — so operations teams can trust AI to help coordinate real equipment and safety-critical decisions.

By targeting metrics to detect and resolve issues and safety incidents, as well as ensure on-time order fulfillment and service level agreement adherence — MAIW helps warehouses move from constant fire drills to more predictable, data-driven shifts.

Partners such as Kinetic Vision, a product and technology development firm, can use the MAIW blueprint to innovate and tackle decades-long issues in retail supply chains.

“Chart and graphs are yesterday, we need predictions and prescribed actions,” said Jeremy Jarrett, CEO of Kinetic Vision. “The NVIDIA MAIW blueprint would allow you to have more of a central way to answer questions and prompt decision-making.”

Resolving Sparse Product Data

The Retail Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprint can help businesses of all sizes achieve richer and accurate product onboarding, as well as deliver localized marketing.

Retailers often face a “sparse data” problem: product images arrive with minimal or inconsistent text, and teams spend large amounts of time writing titles, descriptions and attributes, then customizing them for each market and campaign.

The blueprint addresses this by using generative AI to create high-quality, structured, localized and brand-aligned product content at scale.

For example, imagine a home goods retailer trying to update their online storefront with a basic set of ceramic mug photos. With an NVIDIA Nemotron vision language model (VLM), part of the Retail Catalog Enrichment Blueprint, the photos can be fed through the VLM to develop product metadata such as color, material, capacity, style and use cases.

From a single image, the system can then generate localized product titles and descriptions, extract and normalize attributes for search and recommendation systems for improved SEO and GEO, and create culturally relevant 2D lifestyle imagery and interactive 3D assets. Behind the scenes, an AI “judge” checks outputs for quality and consistency.

In addition, the Retail Catalog Enrichment Blueprint can create rich, on-brand marketing content by applying brand voice, tone and taxonomy instructions via prompts, alongside the product image and a target locale. The blueprint uses those brand guidelines to generate enriched product titles and descriptions, localized categories and tags, and culturally appropriate lifestyle image variations tailored to that intent.

Grid Dynamics’ NVIDIA Blueprint-Powered Solution

Companies are already creating their own products with the help of NVIDIA’s retail blueprints.

Global tech consulting firm Grid Dynamics has built a catalog enrichment and management system that increases the accuracy of item content and status of SKUs for large retailers, using the Retail Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprint.

“The quality of the search and the quality of the browsing experience for customers directly depends on the quality of the catalog data,” said Ilya Katsov, chief technology officer of Grid Dynamics. “It’s a very critical problem for all retailers with a digital presence to ensure their catalogs have as rich and consistent of attributes as possible — and our solution automates this so they don’t need to do manual reviews.”

For bigger retailers with massive product catalogs, attributes can be missing or incorrect. Onboarding new vendors with differing catalog structures can further jumble the data — leading to inaccurate sales, frustration and, eventually, a loss of customer loyalty.

This is where Grid Dynamics’ solution comes into play.

“Our solution makes product catalogs more discoverable while giving brands the ability to enforce their business rules at scale,” said Dan Guja, principal software engineer at Grid Dynamics. “With AI-driven business rules applied across the catalog, brands can improve data quality, sharpen customer intent signals and surface products customers actually want.”

Piecing Together the NVIDIA Retail Pipeline

The MAIW and Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprints are part of a greater initiative to reimagine the warehouse-to-consumer workflow with AI infrastructure at each level.

On the backend, the MAIW blueprint helps managers and warehouse workers in their daily supply and data management tasks, while the Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprint lets digital teams easily curate stylized SKU pages at the click of a button.

However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to ""surge"" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.
""San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.""
Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness.
""I stay laser-focused on what I can control, and that's what's happening here in San Francisco,"" Lurie said.","San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie told CBS News Friday that he was able to convince President Trump in a phone call several months ago not to deploy federal agents to San Francisco.

In a live interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil, Lurie, a moderate Democrat, said that the president called him while he was sitting in a car.

""I took the call, and his first question to me was, 'How's it going there?'"" Lurie recounted.

In October, sources told CBS News that the president was planning to surge Border Patrol agents to San Francisco as part of the White House's ongoing immigration crackdown that has seen it deploy federal immigration officers to cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and most recently, Minneapolis.

At the time, the reports prompted pushback from California officials, including Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to ""surge"" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.

""I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,"" the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 23. The president also noted that ""friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge.""

""I told him what I would tell you,"" Lurie said Friday of his October call with Mr. Trump. ""San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.""

Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness. It was voter frustration over those issues that helped Lurie defeat incumbent London Breed in November 2024.

Lurie, however, acknowledged that the city still has ""a lot of work to do.""

""I'm clear-eyed about our challenges still,"" Lurie said. ""In the daytime, we have really ended our drug markets. At night, we still struggle on some of the those blocks that you see.""

An heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune, Lurie also declined Friday to say whether he supports a proposed California ballot initiative that would institute a one-time 5% tax on the state's billionaires.

""I stay laser-focused on what I can control, and that's what's happening here in San Francisco,"" Lurie said. ""I don't get involved on what may or may not happen up in Sacramento, or frankly, for that matter, D.C.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/10/758109d6-f8b8-43cf-8d5e-508ca65a218e/thumbnail/1200x630/e67521dbce98acba06f2baff4e67a73e/1768006429674.png,N,,2026-01-09 21:00:46.472498

“The strong demand for our hybrid notes and the outcome we achieved reflect deep investor confidence in Aldar’s credit strength and disciplined countercyclical financial strategy.
The hybrid enhances our capital structure with long-term, flexible funding while supporting our investment-grade profile and preserving senior debt capacity for further growth.
Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa3 to the hybrid notes, sitting one notch below Aldar’s corporate rating of Baa2.
The structure of the new hybrid is identical to Aldar’s successful $1 billion hybrid issuance completed in January 2025.","Aldar announced on Friday that it successfully priced its $1 billion subordinated dated hybrid notes. The transaction attracted robust demand from a global institutional investor base, underscoring confidence in Aldar’s credit profile and earnings outlook as it continues to deliver on its transformational growth strategy.

“The strong demand for our hybrid notes and the outcome we achieved reflect deep investor confidence in Aldar’s credit strength and disciplined countercyclical financial strategy. The hybrid enhances our capital structure with long-term, flexible funding while supporting our investment-grade profile and preserving senior debt capacity for further growth. It positions us to continue executing our growth priorities and pipeline with confidence, building on the strong momentum across the business and the real estate market,” said Faisal Falaknaz, group chief financial and sustainability officer at Aldar.

Issuance achieves peak orderbook reaching $4.2 billion

Proceeds from the issuance seek to support the continuation of Aldar’s growth agenda and its strategic priorities, including landbank replenishment, expansion of its develop-to-hold portfolio, strategic acquisitions, optimizing the debt profile to enhance the overall credit profile and preserving debt capacity to fund and support future strategic growth initiatives.

Reflecting strong global confidence in Aldar’s financial strength and its proven track record, the issuance was oversubscribed, with the peak orderbook reaching $4.2 billion and strong participation from institutional investors across diverse geographies.

The final allocation comprises investors from the Middle East (31 percent), United Kingdom (27 percent), North America (24 percent), Asia (10 percent) and Europe (8 percent).

The unsecured, subordinated 30.25-year notes are non-callable for 7.25 years and will bear an initial yield of 5.95 percent and a coupon rate of 5.875 percent. The notes have characteristics of both debt and equity. The coupon payments will be distributed semi-annually and may be deferred. The offering is expected to close on 14th January 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.

Aldar raises $5.1 billion in funding in 2025

As a debt instrument, the issuance is non-dilutive for Aldar equity investors. It is treated as 50 percent equity and 50 percent debt by Moody’s, enhancing Aldar’s overall credit profile while preserving senior debt capacity for future growth initiatives.

Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa3 to the hybrid notes, sitting one notch below Aldar’s corporate rating of Baa2. This rating reflects Aldar’s robust financial position, strong liquidity and its standing as a strategic partner to the Abu Dhabi government.

Marketed under 144A / Reg S, the issuance was globally led and coordinated by Citi, alongside Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Emirates NBD Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo, J.P. Morgan, Mashreq, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, and The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah, acting as joint lead managers and bookrunners.

The structure of the new hybrid is identical to Aldar’s successful $1 billion hybrid issuance completed in January 2025. The $1 billion raised in the latest transaction adds to a total of $5.1 billion in funding raised by the group throughout 2025, including $1.5 billion of hybrid capital, further strengthening the company’s liquidity and capital structure.",https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aldar.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 21:00:55.436492

Each month, eager collectors line up for hours outside Delta's surplus sale in Hapeville, hoping to be among the first allowed inside to buy vintage Delta Airlines items.

""I'm from Atlanta, so I always liked Delta,"" said customer Holden Thomas. ""I grew up flying Delta jets, and this is really exciting to see.""

Once inside, shoppers are greeted by a room packed with airline memorabilia. Items range from vintage Delta signage and airport terminal chairs to replica airplanes. Some lucky visitors stumble upon unexpected treasures—like a Peloton bike from Delta's employee gym or even customized blades from a Delta airplane engine.

""For the three years I've been coming here, they've had blades, but they've never had them customized like this,"" said collector Jack McCormack.

Among the most sought-after items are the iconic galley carts, though none were available at January's sale. Still, that didn't dampen enthusiasm. Shoppers crowded around other collectibles, including limited-edition 100th anniversary golf balls and clubs.

""Golf balls, yes—100-year anniversary golf balls,"" said customer Luis Rivera. ""I like seeing a part of Delta history. My whole family pretty much works for Delta.""

Beyond the nostalgia and collectibles, the sale serves a greater purpose. Proceeds raised more than $275,000 last year, all benefiting the Delta Flight Museum.

At midday this Friday, the CAC 40 is up by 0.75%, reaching 8,305.34 points, driven by an unusual alliance between luxury and finance. The Parisian index shows favorable dispersion with 24 stocks rising against 16 declining, indicating a relatively broad movement but concentrated on a few key leaders. The atmosphere remains marked by low trading volumes, characteristic of the start of the year when many investors are staying on the sidelines. The absence of a major catalyst on the corporate earnings front leaves the market reacting more to technical movements and position adjustments following the first sessions of 2026.

L'Oréal, the cosmetics giant, stands out as the main driver of the increase with a jump of 4.53% to 379.35 euros, accompanied by BNP Paribas, which gains 3.56% to 85.44 euros. This performance by the bank comes as the European financial sector sees renewed interest, without any particular news on the French front. In the luxury sector, Hermès rises by 2.85% to 2,198 euros, while Kering follows with an increase of 2.74% to 318.3 euros, illustrating a temporary renewed appetite for this key sector in the Paris market. STMicroelectronics rounds out the top three gains with a rise of 2.54% to 24.62 euros, benefiting from a positive movement in European semiconductors after several challenging weeks.

Cyclical and Financial Stocks Under Pressure

Defying the trend, Euronext posted the largest drop in the CAC 40, falling 4.08% to 120 euros, as the stock exchange operator suffers from an overall unfavorable climate for trading volumes at the start of the year. Bouygues fell 2.51% to 45.14 euros, reflecting caution surrounding construction and telecommunications stocks. The banking sector showed mixed results: while BNP Paribas soared, Société Générale declined by 2.13% to 68.88 euros, highlighting some shifts within the financial sector. Vinci dropped 1.94% to 121.35 euros following Bouygues, as both French construction giants navigate a wait-and-see environment for major infrastructure projects. AXA rounded out the top declines with a 1.56% drop to 39.81 euros, as the insurer faced profit-taking after several sessions of gains. This bipolar configuration of the Parisian market indicates a session of repositioning rather than a movement of conviction, with investors favoring quality stocks and sector leaders while reducing positions in cyclicals and certain financials.

A European and International Context Defined by Caution

Other European markets are experiencing a similar environment this Friday midday, with moderate gains and limited trading volumes. This widespread sluggishness marks the start of 2026, as investors await clearer signals on the economic situation and the direction of monetary policies. In Paris, Friday's session exemplifies this phase of observation: the CAC 40 is indeed rising, but more due to a few standout performers rather than any underlying momentum. Low volumes confirm that major fund managers remain cautious, opting for prudence before making significant moves at the beginning of the year.

Johnson & Johnson Commits $2 Billion to North Carolina Manufacturing Expansion.","Johnson & Johnson has reached a voluntary agreement with the Trump Administration to join TrumpRx, a direct-to-patient platform with a goal to lower US drug prices and align them with that of their European counterparts.1

In exchange for joining the program, J&J will be exempt from tariffs.

“Today’s agreement shows that when the public and private sectors work together towards shared goals, we can deliver real results for patients and the US economy,” noted Joaquin Duato, J&J’s chairman and CEO.1 “I’m proud that Johnson & Johnson is answering President Trump’s call to lower drug prices for everyday Americans while maintaining our role in improving and saving lives and ensuring that the United States continues to lead the world in healthcare innovation.”

TrumpRx expands big pharma participation

Since President Trump’s reveal of TrumpRx in late September,2 15 companies have agreed to join the government-run website. Besides J&J, the most recent additions came last month, when the president held a briefing3 in which he revealed nine additional Big Pharma participants, including:

Amgen

Boehringer Ingelheim

Bristol-Myers Squibb

Genentech

Gilead

GSK

Merck

Novartis

Sanofi

During the press event, Trump also mentioned that he had reached new agreements with various European leaders to confirm that drug prices in those respective nations were consistent with those in the US, using the threat of levies to help negotiate.

What the TrumpRx agreement means for drug pricing and patient access

As for J&J, the company will be working with the current administration to prioritize drug affordability and patient access, signifying that by participating in TrumpRx, patients in the US will be able to purchase J&J meds at “significantly discounted” prices.1 Access to Medicaid will also come at a similar price compared with other countries.

Johnson & Johnson reinforces US manufacturing and investment strategy

Meanwhile, the company continues to stand by its $55 billion pledge to support domestic manufacturing, research and development, and tech investments by 2029. This past August, the company announced $2 billion plans to boost its North Carolina presence by constructing a 160,0000-plus-square-foot manufacturing facility at FUJIFILM’s new biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs, NC.4

“Johnson & Johnson has more manufacturing facilities in the US than in any other country, and we continue to strengthen our presence here,” said Duato at the time of the announcement.4 “With the recent signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, we continue to expand our investment in the US to lead the next era of healthcare innovation.”

Policy shifts, OBBA, and the broader pharma market impact

Also known as the OBBA, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reshapes prescription drug spending, while pushing pharma companies to mitigate its potential impact on innovation, R&D investment, and M&A activity.

“Starting out with the One Big Beautiful Bill, I kind of look at a couple things that are happening at the same time,” explained Philip Sclafani, PwC's pharmaceutical and life sciences lead, in a video interview5 with Pharma Commerce.

… “We think about those patients unfortunately not being able to get all the prescriptions they would want, spending and pharma company revenues going down there. On the other side, we do see significant innovation coming in from newer therapies—obviously GLP-1s continuing to grow, and others—so I think it's important to look at the totality.”

Also in the works for J&J are two additional US production plants, featuring a cell therapy manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, along with a product manufacturing facility in North Carolina.1

The completion of the deal, which occurred on Thursday, removes the regulatory overhang that had persisted since the initial announcement.

A Dual-Pronged Growth Strategy Emerges

Market analysts are framing IBM's recent actions as a two-track approach to growth. The immediate focus is on the integration of Confluent, whose technology is built on the industry-standard Apache Kafka data-streaming platform. The core rationale is clear: modern enterprises require live data pipelines to supply AI models with up-to-the-minute information, and Confluent provides the necessary infrastructure. IBM's CEO, Arvind Krishna, anticipates rapid alignment of the two companies' sales networks, with IBM's global consulting arm poised to embed Confluent's solutions directly into existing client engagements. Expected revenue synergies from this combination are a key point of interest for shareholders.

Concurrently, IBM is advancing its long-term ambitions in quantum computing. The company recently unveiled its new ""Nighthawk"" quantum processor, which features 120 qubits. This processor utilizes a novel manufacturing technology based on 300-millimeter wafers, representing a significant technological leap toward the goal of fault-tolerant quantum computers, a milestone targeted for 2029.

Institutional Confidence and Upcoming Financials

Alongside these corporate developments, regulatory filings indicate growing institutional interest. For instance, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund recently increased its stake in IBM, a signal often interpreted as confidence in the company's medium-term transformation trajectory.

Investor attention now shifts to the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for the end of January. Market participants will be looking for early insights into the Confluent integration process and the combined revenue outlook for 2026. A central question will be the speed at which Confluent's sales team can be effectively incorporated into IBM's broader organization. From a technical perspective, IBM's share price is trading near its 52-week high. A successful execution of the integration strategy could potentially propel the equity beyond the $325 resistance level. This outlook was echoed by analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded IBM to a ""Buy"" rating this week, citing the potent combination of an accelerated software business through Confluent and continued hardware innovation in quantum computing.

Key Takeaways:

BNY launched tokenized deposits to allow on-chain transfers while keeping funds within the regulated banking system.

The service supports faster, 24/7 settlement and programmable transactions for collateral and margin use cases.

The move reflects growing institutional adoption of tokenization by major global banks.

In an announcement published Friday, BNY said it has facilitated an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform.

The initiative marks the first phase of the bank’s strategy to tokenize deposits, starting with collateral and margin workflow use cases.

BNY Says Tokenized Deposits Mirror Bank Balances On-chain

The tokenized deposits operate as digital book entries that reflect clients’ existing demand deposit claims against the bank.

While balances are mirrored on-chain, they continue to be recorded on BNY’s traditional systems, ensuring regulatory, accounting, and reporting consistency.

The capability runs on BNY’s private, permissioned blockchain and is governed by the bank’s existing risk and compliance frameworks.

BNY said the launch is designed to support programmable, near-real-time cash movement as financial markets shift toward always-on operating models.

Tokenized deposits could help reduce settlement friction, improve liquidity efficiency, and allow rules-based payments across institutional workflows.

Early participants include Intercontinental Exchange, Citadel Securities, DRW Holdings, Baillie Gifford, Circle, Ripple Prime, and several other financial and digital asset firms.

ICE said it plans to support tokenized deposits across its clearinghouses as it prepares for 24/7 trading and settlement.

In September, BNY announced it is making strides towards offering custody services for Bitcoin and Ether, specifically for its exchange-traded product (ETP) clients.

Earlier this year, the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant reportedly reviewed BNY Mellon’s approach to crypto custody.

The SEC didn’t object to BNY Mellon’s decision not to include these crypto assets as liabilities on its balance sheet.

The review was key because of the SEC’s SAB 121 rule, which requires banks to account for crypto assets they safeguard as both a liability and an asset on their balance sheets.

BNY Mellon’s unique case with ETPs, however, which bypasses this requirement.

About two dozen drivers and supporters spoke or held up signs calling for safer streets and greater accountability outside the offices of the California Public Utilities Commission, which met Friday to consider further regulations on autonomous vehicles.

A steady stream of Waymo cars drove past the protest, a testament to the growing ubiquity of the white cars in San Francisco.

“I personally am not against technology; what I am against is unfair treatment,” said Joseph Augusto, who drives for both Uber and Lyft. “We have these people, these companies, these autonomous vehicle companies who are driving around the city, and they don’t seem to be held to the same standards as we drivers.”

The California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates Uber and Lyft, is refining and expanding policies around autonomous robotaxis as the industry grows. The California Gig Workers Union says the vehicles should be removed from streets until safety concerns are addressed.

The state agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

Hobbled Waymos blocked San Francisco streets during a mass power outage days before Christmas, forcing the company to pause service and raising questions about the cars’ ability to adapt to real-world driving conditions.

In September, a Waymo pulled an illegal U-turn in front of a sign telling drivers not to do that, but San Bruno police could not issue a ticket because there was no human driver. In October, a Waymo crushed a popular neighborhood cat named Kit Kat.

Augusto, the driver, said he saw Waymos stalled at intersections as people darted around them on Dec. 20 when the lights went out across San Francisco.

“There were a lot of Waymos around. Just randomly all over the city and there’s no plan,” he said.",https://www.wcbi.com/content/uploads/2026/01/f/h/mgn-1280x960-20324b00-qvmah.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:14:58.669309

This recent mass scanning campaign systematically targeted more than 73-plus LLM model endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible API and Google Gemini formats, GreyNoise said in a blog post Thursday.
These IP addresses were observed in past GreyNoise data conducting CVE exploitation campaigns for more than 200 different vulnerabilities, including React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) and the TP-Link router flaw CVE-2023-1389.
GreyNoise said the data indicates the attacker targeting LLM endpoints is a “professional threat actor conducting reconnaissance” who is “building target lists” for future exploitation of exposed AI APIs.

More than 91,000 attack sessions were recorded by GreyNoise’s Ollama honeypot infrastructure between October 2025 and January 2026; 80,469 of these sessions took place over the 11-day period between Dec. 28, 2025, and Jan. 8, 2026.

This recent mass scanning campaign systematically targeted more than 73-plus LLM model endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible API and Google Gemini formats, GreyNoise said in a blog post Thursday.

Models targeted included OpenAI’s GPT family, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Alibaba’s Qwen and xAI’s Grok.

Related reading:

The activity indicates that threat actors were probing for misconfigured servers leaking access to commercial AI APIs. The attackers tested the endpoints with text queries to see which models would respond, with the most common query being “hi,” at 32,716 occurrences, and the second most common being “How many states are there in the United States?” at 27,778 occurrences.

Just two IP addresses were behind all 80,469 sessions — one U.S.-based IP address generated 49,955 sessions and another Netherlands-based address generated 30,514 sessions.

These IP addresses were observed in past GreyNoise data conducting CVE exploitation campaigns for more than 200 different vulnerabilities, including React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) and the TP-Link router flaw CVE-2023-1389.

The two addresses racked up a total history of more than 4 million GreyNoise sensor hits combined.

GreyNoise said the data indicates the attacker targeting LLM endpoints is a “professional threat actor conducting reconnaissance” who is “building target lists” for future exploitation of exposed AI APIs.

“If you’re running exposed LLM endpoints, you’re likely already on someone’s list,” Bob Rudis, vice president of data science at GreyNoise, wrote in the blog post.

In addition to blocking the offending IP addresses, GreyNoise recommended rate-limiting suspicious autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as those used in the campaign, monitoring for rapid requests to multiple LLM endpoints and watching for specific queries that appeared frequently in the scanning campaign, such as “How many states are there in the United States?” and “How many letter r are in the word strawberry?”

Separate campaign spiked over Christmas

GreyNoise’s blog post also highlighted a separate campaign that ran from October 2025 and January 2026, which spiked over Christmas, generating 1,688 sessions over a 48-hour period.

This campaign abused Ollama’s model pull functionality to exploit server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities by injecting malicious registry URLs. The attackers were observed using ProjectDiscovery’s Out-of-band Application Security Testing (OAST) infrastructure to confirm exploitation success.

GreyNoise noted that this campaign coincided with another targeting Twilio SMS webhook integrations, which manipulated MediaUrl parameters to achieve outbound connections to the attacker’s server.

The vast majority of attacks (99%) shared the same JA4H signature despite being spread across 62 different IP addresses spanning 27 countries. This pattern points to the attackers potentially using a virtual private server (VPS) along with a shared automation tool such as ProjectDiscovery’s Nuclei to conduct their activity, Greynoise noted.

The researchers ultimately assessed that this campaign likely originated from security researchers or bug bounty hunters but potentially crossed over into grey-hat activity due to the unusually high volume of attacks over the Christmas holiday.

To defend against such SSRF campaigns targeting Ollama deployments, GreyNoise recommends configuring Ollama so that only models from trusted registries can be pulled, blocking OAST at the domain name system (DNS) layer and monitor for JA4 fingerprints indicating automated tooling such as that used in the observed campaign.",https://files.cyberriskalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_1372668605_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:58:37.082190

Snake River is always exploring new product ideas and ways to introduce incredible regional cuts to audiences who may have never experienced them before, Kelso said.
Brisket, she said, will always be BBQ royalty — but there are so many exceptional cuts that deserve their moment in the spotlight.
“If we limit BBQ to just brisket and ribs, we miss out on a world of truly delicious possibilities.
Cooks are experimenting more, “playing with their food,” and pushing beyond traditional low-and-slow smoking into hot-and-fast, direct-flame and other techniques.","Over the past decade, Snake River Farms has seen a steady and significant rise in consumer demand for traditional BBQ cuts — most notably beef brisket, but also ribs, shoulder, and most recently pork collars, said Annella Kelso, the company’s head of e-mail and BBQ marketing. But increasingly, Americans are also open to experimenting with new cuts.

The overall growth, she said, has been fueled in large part by the explosive popularity of competitive BBQ and the rise of BBQ-focused television, streaming, and digital content.

“As more people are exposed to the craft through these platforms, they’re becoming not just fans of BBQ, but students of it. Today’s consumers want to understand the process, hone their skills, and recreate authentic, competition-quality results at home. That passion for mastering the art of smoke continues to drive sustained demand across the entire category.”

Social media allows people to learn how to BBQ in real time — how to select the right cut, how to season it, how to manage a fire, and how to achieve great results at home.

Snake River is always exploring new product ideas and ways to introduce incredible regional cuts to audiences who may have never experienced them before, Kelso said. Brisket, she said, will always be BBQ royalty — but there are so many exceptional cuts that deserve their moment in the spotlight.

Cuts like picanha, bavette (sirloin flap) and outside skirt steak are gaining traction as pitmasters and home cooks experiment with different techniques and flavors.

“If we limit BBQ to just brisket and ribs, we miss out on a world of truly delicious possibilities. What’s exciting right now — and moving into the future — is how open consumers are to discovery, experimentation, and elevating everyday cooking through fire.”

Live-fire cooking is another huge trend that Snake River is tracking right now, and it’s changing the way people approach BBQ. Cooks are experimenting more, “playing with their food,” and pushing beyond traditional low-and-slow smoking into hot-and-fast, direct-flame and other techniques.

That openness, Kelso said, has created space for people to explore unique cuts they might not normally smoke — “and we’re absolutely here for that kind of creativity.”

Tallow is also having a major moment, she added. More people are frying in it, wrapping with it, and using it as a flavor-builder across all kinds of cooking — not just BBQ.

Une dégradation du marché de l'emploi serait interprétée comme un signe du ralentissement de l'activité, ce qui offrirait davantage de marges de manœuvre à la Fed pour baisser ses taux, un scénario positif pour les marchés d'actions.

ID7,Best Buy,2026-01-09 20:02:16+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Trump Orders Fannie and Freddie to Buy $200 Billion in Mortgage Bonds,"Matthew Goldstein, Joe Rennison, www.nytimes.com, matthew-goldstein, joe-rennison",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/business/trump-fannie-freddie-mortgage-bonds.html,"In a post on social media on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds.
While his announcement was short on details, bond investors reacted quickly to the potential for giant government purchases of mortgage bonds.
In theory, if Fannie and Freddie again became a buyer of mortgage bonds, it would provide a new investor for those securities, pushing up the price of those mortgage bonds, and, in theory, might also help reduce mortgage rates broadly.
Fannie and Freddie are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and its director, Bill Pulte, a stalwart ally of Mr. Trump.
The report noted that the Fed often calmed the markets by buying mortgage-backed bonds.","President Trump said he was ordering the two big government-controlled mortgage finance firms to start buying bonds backed by mortgages, his latest bid to make it easier for Americans to buy a home.

In a post on social media on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. While his announcement was short on details, bond investors reacted quickly to the potential for giant government purchases of mortgage bonds.

After the statement, the difference between the interest rates on mortgage bonds and Treasuries narrowed by 0.1 percentage points, a sharp move in that market and an early indication that the initiative could have some effect on the mortgage market.

Some analysts questioned the extent of the impact on consumer mortgage rates over time, given that those rates are influenced by a number of factors, including Federal Reserve policy.

Mr. Trump’s announcement is part of a recent effort by the White House to show it is responding to the public’s concerns about the cost of living and specifically the issue of housing affordability. It is an issue that could dog Republicans in this year’s midterm elections.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted Congress to bar big Wall Street firms from buying more single-family homes to operate as rental properties. Some housing experts have said institutional buyers of single-family homes have driven up home prices and led to higher rents in some communities.

Mr. Trump is also said to be considering asking Congress to permit home buyers to take money out of their retirement savings to pay for down payments.

A move by Fannie and Freddie to buy mortgage-backed securities would be a back-to-future moment of sorts. Buying risky mortgage-backed securities was one investment strategy that got the two firms in trouble in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, when many homeowners fell into default. The federal government was forced to step in and take them over to avoid bankruptcy.

The main job of Fannie and Freddie is to buy mortgages from banks and loans and package them into bonds that are sold to investors. In selling home loans to Fannie and Freddie so they can be packaged into bonds, banks and lenders are freed up to do more lending.

In theory, if Fannie and Freddie again became a buyer of mortgage bonds, it would provide a new investor for those securities, pushing up the price of those mortgage bonds, and, in theory, might also help reduce mortgage rates broadly. Bond prices move inversely to rates.

“There is no question if Fannie and Freddie get back into buying mortgage bonds for their portfolios, mortgage rates will undoubtedly fall,” said David Dworkin, president and chief executive officer of the National Housing Conference, a coalition of affordable housing providers.

Mr. Dworkin, a Treasury official during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said Mr. Trump’s idea was an intriguing one. But some mortgage analysts questioned how much of an impact it would have.

“This could have a small impact on affordability,” said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income strategy at Brean Capital, in emailed comments, with rates falling as much as 0.25 percentage points.

But he added that the move could give a boost to mortgage refinancing activity, which is still economically important.

The average 30-year mortgage rate stood at 6.23 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since September 2022, according to Bankrate.

Mr. Buchta said that if mortgage rates fell below 6 percent, that would be “a huge positive” for the psychology of the market.

Fannie and Freddie are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and its director, Bill Pulte, a stalwart ally of Mr. Trump. One of the first things that Mr. Pulte did after being sworn into office last year was to appoint himself as the chairman of the boards of both companies.

“We are on it, Mr. President,” Mr. Pulte said Thursday on social media, responding to Mr. Trump’s proposal.

Just a few days ago, the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, published a report commenting on the fact that the big market for mortgage-backed securities was “operating without a net” because the Federal Reserve had reduced its role as buyer of last resort for mortgage bonds. The report noted that the Fed often calmed the markets by buying mortgage-backed bonds.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08biz-trump-mortgage-bonds-lcfg/08biz-trump-mortgage-bonds-lcfg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 19:03:23.872585

Winners and Losers in the Biotech Shakeup The primary winner in this transaction is undoubtedly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).
By securing Ventyx’s oral platform, Lilly gains a technological edge over competitors who are still reliant on injectable immunology treatments.
Historically, this move mirrors Lilly’s previous successful acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion purchase of Dice Therapeutics in 2023, which also focused on oral immunology.
Summary and Investor Outlook The acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences by Eli Lilly is a masterclass in strategic M&A, perfectly timed to coincide with Lilly's peak market influence and technical stock strength.","In a move that underscores the tightening intersection between metabolic health and systemic inflammation, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) officially announced on January 7, 2026, its definitive agreement to acquire Ventyx Biosciences (NASDAQ: VTYX) for approximately $1.2 billion. The all-cash transaction, priced at $14.00 per share, represents a significant 62% premium over Ventyx's 30-day volume-weighted average price. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment for Lilly as it seeks to fortify its immunology portfolio and explore the ""holy grail"" of drug development: the combination of weight-loss therapies with oral anti-inflammatory agents.

The immediate market reaction was swift and decisive. Shares of Ventyx Biosciences surged over 60% following the announcement, while Eli Lilly saw its stock jump 3.3% in early trading, clearing a critical technical resistance level of $1,080. For Lilly, which recently became the first healthcare entity to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization in late 2025, the acquisition is seen as a strategic ""bolt-on"" that could yield exponential returns if Ventyx’s oral small-molecule pipeline successfully navigates upcoming Phase 2 readouts.

The Crown Jewels of the Ventyx Pipeline

The centerpiece of this deal is Ventyx’s portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors, specifically VTX3232 and VTX2735. NLRP3 is a protein complex that acts as a ""master switch"" for the body's inflammatory response. VTX3232 is a central nervous system-penetrant inhibitor currently in Phase 2 trials for Parkinson’s disease and obesity-associated cardiometabolic diseases. Data released in late 2025 indicated that VTX3232 could reduce inflammation biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), by nearly 80% in patients with obesity. By acquiring this asset, Lilly aims to pair it with its blockbuster GLP-1 agonist, Zepbound (tirzepatide), to treat the underlying inflammation that often persists even after significant weight loss.

Beyond NLRP3, the acquisition brings tamuzimod (VTX002), an oral S1P1 receptor modulator in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and VTX958, a highly selective allosteric TYK2 inhibitor. These assets are designed to compete in the high-growth immunology market, where the shift from injectable biologics to convenient oral pills is rapidly accelerating. The timeline leading to this deal was catalyzed by Ventyx's successful mid-stage data in late 2025, which caught the eye of Lilly’s business development team as they looked for ways to diversify beyond their core diabetes and weight-loss franchises.

Winners and Losers in the Biotech Shakeup

The primary winner in this transaction is undoubtedly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). By securing Ventyx’s oral platform, Lilly gains a technological edge over competitors who are still reliant on injectable immunology treatments. The deal also validates Lilly's strategy of using its massive cash flow from GLP-1 sales to ""buy the future"" of the biotech sector. Ventyx shareholders are also clear victors, realizing a substantial premium after a volatile 2024 and 2025 for the small-cap biotech space.

Conversely, the ""losers"" or those under increased pressure include legacy immunology giants like AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). AbbVie, which has long dominated the space with Humira and its successors Rinvoq and Skyrizi, now faces a formidable rival in Lilly that can offer a combined metabolic-immunology approach. Bristol Myers Squibb, which markets the TYK2 inhibitor Sotyktu, may see its market share threatened if Ventyx’s VTX958 proves to have a superior safety profile or better efficacy in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) may find itself playing catch-up in the ""inflammation-obesity nexus,"" as it currently lacks a comparable NLRP3 asset to pair with its own GLP-1, Wegovy.

A New Era of ""Oral Biologics"" and Metabolic Synergy

This acquisition fits into a broader industry trend toward ""oral biologics""—small molecules that offer the potency of traditional injectable antibodies but with the convenience of a daily pill. As the pharmaceutical sector moves toward 2030, the ability to provide oral treatments for complex autoimmune diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s is expected to be a major differentiator. The deal also highlights the growing realization that obesity is not just a metabolic condition but a chronic inflammatory state, suggesting that the next generation of ""super-blockbusters"" will likely be combination therapies.

Historically, this move mirrors Lilly’s previous successful acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion purchase of Dice Therapeutics in 2023, which also focused on oral immunology. However, the Ventyx deal is more ambitious in its scope, targeting the CNS-penetrant NLRP3 pathway. Regulatory scrutiny is expected to be manageable, as the deal is relatively small for a company of Lilly’s size and does not present immediate antitrust concerns in any single therapeutic market, given that most of Ventyx's assets are still in the clinical stage.

Technical Breakout and the Path Ahead

From a technical perspective, Eli Lilly's stock is currently in a ""blue sky"" breakout phase. After consolidating between $700 and $800 for much of mid-2025, the stock surged through the $1,000 psychological barrier in November. The Ventyx announcement acted as a catalyst to push the stock toward its all-time high of $1,117. Analysts at major firms have already begun raising their 2026 price targets, with some forecasting a move toward $1,500 by year-end, contingent on the successful integration of Ventyx’s assets and continued growth in the GLP-1 market.

In the short term, investors should watch for Phase 2 data readouts for VTX3232 in Parkinson's and obesity, expected in mid-2026. These results will be the first real test of whether Lilly’s $1.2 billion bet will pay off. Long-term, the strategic pivot will require Lilly to successfully manage a sprawling pipeline that now touches everything from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s to IBD and obesity. The challenge will be maintaining the clinical momentum of these diverse assets without spreading its research and development resources too thin.

Summary and Investor Outlook

The acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences by Eli Lilly is a masterclass in strategic M&A, perfectly timed to coincide with Lilly's peak market influence and technical stock strength. By securing a leading position in the NLRP3 and TYK2 pathways, Lilly is not just expanding its immunology footprint; it is redefining the treatment paradigm for metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

For investors, the key takeaways are clear: Lilly is aggressively defending its $1 trillion valuation by diversifying its revenue streams. Moving forward, the market will be hyper-focused on the synergy between Zepbound and Ventyx’s anti-inflammatory molecules. As the ""obesity wars"" between Lilly and Novo Nordisk evolve into the ""inflammation wars,"" the ability to provide a comprehensive, oral, multi-disease solution will likely determine the next decade's healthcare leader. Watch for further consolidation in the small-cap biotech space as other pharmaceutical titans look to replicate Lilly's bold move.

These deposits represent onchain cash balances or depositor claims against the bank, issued on an in-house permissioned blockchain network. This development marks a significant step in the evolution of financial services, as institutions increasingly seek faster and more efficient asset movement with enhanced settlement certainty, transparency, and liquidity.

BNY Mellon's initiative is part of a broader trend among major financial institutions to integrate blockchain technology into traditional finance systems. As global financial markets transition to an always-on operating model, the demand for streamlined asset movement grows. The introduction of tokenized bank deposits is a response to this shift, aiming to reduce friction and unlock liquidity in financial transactions. This move aligns with the ongoing overhaul of legacy financial infrastructure to accommodate the digital age.

In a related development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have proposed a transition to 24/7 capital markets. Their joint statement, released in September 2025, suggests that expanding trading hours could better align U.S. markets with the global economy's evolving reality. The traditional financial system, reliant on intermediaries, does not operate during nights, weekends, or certain holidays, which can leave investors and traders unable to act when markets are closed.

Blockchain technology, by eliminating intermediaries and enabling round-the-clock operations, offers reduced settlement times, lower transaction costs, and decreased friction in cross-border commerce. Real-world asset tokenization (RWA) is a key component in facilitating 24/7 capital markets, allowing physical or traditional assets to be represented on a blockchain. This approach is particularly beneficial for traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate and collectibles. However, the SEC and CFTC have noted that while 24/7 onchain markets and tokenization are viable for certain asset classes, a universal approach may not be suitable for all. The financial industry continues to explore these innovations as it adapts to the demands of a digital economy.",https://public.bnbstatic.com/images/common/feed-og-image-2.png,N,,2026-01-09 17:14:48.075479

Spark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.
After an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.
Johnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.
Nvidia staffers ramp up responses Following Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.","An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.

The thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.

The thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.

While much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the ""ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.""

Spark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.

An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

Anshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.

In recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and ""sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.""

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang steps into the fray

In the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.

After an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.

""Jump on x and say you will fix,"" he wrote.

Subsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.

Johnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.

Nvidia staffers ramp up responses

Following Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.

Staffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.

Another incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.

Kouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.

After an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.

""While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,"" Kouzios told Business Insider. ""In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.""

It's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more ""high-touch"" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally ""hands-on"" CEO.

Nvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.

While a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.

""C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,"" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. ""It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.""",https://i.insider.com/696127a1832e0ef1ead77ac9?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 15:00:34.606467

Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.9%.","Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. PACB, popularly known as PacBio, announced a new community-developed method, CiFi, yesterday. It enables chromosome-scale, haplotype-resolved genome assemblies from a single sequencing run, even when sample material is limited.

It is worth mentioning that researchers in the Megan Dennis Laboratory at the University of California, Davis, showed how CiFi addresses long-standing limitations of short-read Hi-C by generating long, highly accurate reads that capture multiple chromatin interactions within a single molecule. The new method is expected to offer numerous advantages tailored to the requirements of genome biology, biodiversity studies and functional genomics.

The latest announcement is expected to significantly boost PacBio’s sequencing solutions business and strengthen its foothold in the niche space.

Trend in PACB Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, shares of the company lost nearly 4.2% till yesterday’s close.

Historically, the company has gained a top-line boost from its various product innovations and launches. Although the latest announcement is likely to be beneficial for PACB’s top-line growth in the future, the stock declined overall.

PacBio currently has a market capitalization of $615.9 million. It has a current ratio of 6.2 compared with the industry’s 2.3. In the last reported quarter, PACB delivered an earnings surprise of 25%.

Significance of PACB’s Latest Announcement

Per PacBio, CiFi delivers multi-contact reads and longer fragments by integrating chromatin conformation capture (3C) with its HiFi long-read sequencing. These fragments significantly increase the information content of proximity ligation experiments in a single Revio sequencing run.

PacBio also states that CiFi, when paired with Revio SPRQ chemistry, will likely be able to generate reference-quality assemblies using fewer cells, fewer libraries and fewer sequencing runs. This is expected to lower barriers for genome projects that have been limited by cost, complexity or sample availability.

Management believes that CiFi will likely expand PACB’s multiomics capabilities, increasing the capabilities of the HiFi sequencing systems without new hardware and unlock new customer use cases.

Industry Prospects in Favor of PacBio

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global sequencing market was estimated at $15,540.0 million in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $62,478.8 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 22.2%. Factors like the growing demand for gene therapy and a significant increase in demand for consumer genomics in recent years are likely to drive the market.

Given the market potential, the latest product availability is expected to provide a significant boost to PacBio’s business.

PACB’s Notable Developments

In November 2025, PacBio announced its third-quarter 2025 results, wherein it unveiled new SPRQ-Nx sequencing chemistry and consumables, which are expected to reduce sequencing costs by up to 40%. During the quarter, PACB launched an expanded PureTarget portfolio of long-read HiFi assays covering difficult-to-sequence genes in carrier screening, supporting throughput for up to 100,000 samples per Revio system per year.

The same month, PacBio announced that, through its partnership with Berry Genomics, the Sequel II CNDx system had received Class III Medical Device Registration approval from the National Medical Products Administration in China.

To quickly recap, the CalPrivacy Board created a Data Broker Enforcement Strike Force to investigate privacy violations by the data broker industry. Additionally, the Delete Act was created to provide a single mechanism for Californians to request their data be deleted from multiple brokers’ databases. The Delete Act requires data brokers to register and pay an annual fee which helps fund the development of the Delete Request and Opt-Out Platform (Drop). Failure to register as required leads to investigations (and fines) by the Strike Force and that is exactly what happened here.

A Texas limited liability company Rickenbacher Data LLC d/b/a/ Datamasters was fined $45,000 for failing to register as a data broker in violation of the Delete Act. Datamasters bought and resold the names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information of millions of people with Alzheimer’s disease, drug addiction and other health problems for targeted advertising. Additionally, as explained in the decision, Datamasters bought and resold lists of people based on age and race as evidenced by them offering “Senior Lists” and “Hispanic Lists,” as well as lists based on political views, grocery store purchases, health-related purchases and other identifiable means. This was all done while they failed to register with the California Data Broker Registry. The Agency found that while Datamasters tried to comply with California’s privacy laws at various points, those attempts were imperfect and “lacked sufficient written policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Delete Act….”

For failing to register as required by the Delete Act and complying with applicable privacy laws, the Agency fined Datamasters $42,000.00. The Agency reasoned that not only was this fine warranted because of the failure to register but the head of enforcement at CalPrivacy said that “reselling list of people battling Alzheimer’s disease is a recipe for trouble…in the wrong hands, these lists could be used to target people for more than just advertising and the same risks apply to selling lists of seniors…people who identify as conservative or liberal….” Not only was the fine warranted for not registering as required but given that such personal and intimate information of the most vulnerable members of society was being sold, ensuring that there was accountability was paramount for the Agency.

The second decision required a New York based provider of data and technology known as S&P Global, Inc. to pay a $62,000.00 fine for failing to register as a data broker. From the decision, the Agency found that S&P Global failed to register because of an administrative error as evidenced in the decision that read in part “S&P Global intended to register the company as a data broker for its 2024 activities and S&P Global believed that the registration had been completed….” An investigation was opened as to why S&P Global was not registered and after the company learned that they were being investigated, they quickly acted to complete the registration. However, because they were unregistered for 313 days, the Agency found that the fine was warranted and issued new terms to the company to ensure such oversight does not happen again (to which S&P Global agreed to). Those terms were adopting written policies and procedures to ensure timely registration as a data broker in compliance with the Delete Act and reviewing its procedures for auditing data broker registration status and update those audit procedures as the company deems appropriate to identify missing or incomplete registration.

While the second circumstance seems to be a good faith error as opposed to the first decision, both orders underscore the importance of adhering to the requirements posed by the Delete Act. California has taken a much more active approach in how they oversee the handling of people’s personal information and will look to hold data brokers accountable for any missteps regardless of the reason. These preventative measures are enacted to ensure that the most intimate details of people’s lives stay private unless they consent to disclose such information. California seeks to empower consumers with greater control over their personal data and ensuring compliance of requirements set forth in the Delete Act by the data brokers is a crucial component in empowering the public. These orders serve as a reminder to the companies that acquire and sell data that it is up to them to ensure that they are diligent in adhering to all the requirements.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2026-01/CCPA%20Compliance%20CPRA%20California%20Data%20Privacy.jpg.webp?itok=oG4PgQLc,N,,2026-01-09 14:02:35.396137

""With this deployment, we're not just processing data-we're creating a new asset class with national security-grade protection, opening revenue streams that could potential exceed $2 billion annually in this market alone.""

""These two larger deployments that include IBM's WatsonX.ai will be complemented by the Datavault AI and Available Infrastructure build out of 100 locations that each have estimated, and additional serviceable addressable markets (SAM) potential exceeding $100 million from each market. ""

The Datavault AI Edge Network activation will support multiple monetization channels, including:

Real-time quantum encrypted tokenization fees for converting enterprise data into tradable assets

GPU-backed AI processing for financial modeling, risk analytics, and fraud prevention

Per-event revenue from credentialing, identity scoring, and secure attestations

DataScore applications in advertising, compliance, and predictive analytics

Operation of private token exchanges within SanQtum's secure network

Looking Ahead

Datavault AI and Available Infrastructure look forward to expanding this national rollout and supporting additional customer deployments that benefit from secure communications, secure storage, near-edge compute, and secure data processing. As coverage scales across the U.S., the companies expect the combined infrastructure footprint to help accelerate trusted tokenization, exchange, and valuation workflows by placing cybersecure edge nodes closer to where data is generated and decisions are made.

In late 2025, the company was rocked by the ""Martin Bally Scandal,"" involving leaked recordings of a high-ranking executive making disparaging remarks about the company's own products and employees.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) has fared even worse, announcing a massive plan to split into two independent companies by late 2026 in a desperate bid to unlock value from its aging portfolio.
However, the 2025–2026 period has shattered that precedent.
However, with the snacks division itself seeing a 5% organic decline in late 2025, the ""snack-led growth"" thesis is under immense pressure.","In a move that has further dampened investor sentiment, a top executive at The Campbell’s Company (NYSE: CPB) has offloaded a significant portion of his holdings just as the consumer staples giant closes out one of its most challenging years in recent history. Charles A. Brawley III, the company’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel, sold approximately $325,000 worth of stock in late December 2025, according to recent regulatory filings. The transaction occurred as the stock price languished near decade-lows, highlighting a growing disconnect between the firm's leadership and its long-term equity value.

The timing of the sale is particularly conspicuous, coming on the heels of a 33% decline in share price over the past 12 months. As of early January 2026, Campbell’s is grappling with a perfect storm of internal reputational crises, a difficult leadership transition, and a broader industry-wide shift where consumers are increasingly abandoning legacy national brands in favor of cheaper private-label alternatives. For a company that has spent over a century as a cornerstone of the American pantry, the current trajectory suggests a fundamental identity crisis that a simple rebranding to ""The Campbell’s Company"" has yet to solve.

A Legal Chief’s Exit Amidst a 52-Week Low

The specific transaction, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 31, 2025, involved the sale of 11,550 shares by Charles A. Brawley III at an average price of $28.14 per share. This divestment represented roughly 21% of Brawley’s direct holdings in the company. While executive sales are often planned in advance for tax or diversification purposes, the decision to execute a trade at a price point nearly 35% lower than its January 2025 peak of $44.00 has raised eyebrows among market analysts.

The timeline leading up to this sale has been marred by a series of operational and PR setbacks. In late 2025, the company was rocked by the ""Martin Bally Scandal,"" involving leaked recordings of a high-ranking executive making disparaging remarks about the company's own products and employees. The fallout from these comments led to immediate consumer boycotts and regulatory inquiries from state attorneys general regarding food labeling and manufacturing processes. This internal turmoil coincided with the first full year under CEO Mick Beekhuizen, who took the helm in early 2025 following the departure of Mark Clouse. Beekhuizen’s tenure has so far been defined by a ""muted"" growth outlook and a struggle to maintain the momentum of the company’s snacks division.

Initial market reactions to the insider selling and the year-end financial performance have been pessimistic. Major brokerages, including UBS and RBC, have slashed their price targets for CPB to the $26–$27 range, citing deteriorating gross margins. In its Q1 2026 earnings report, Campbell’s revealed a 3.4% decline in revenue, with margins squeezed to 29.9% due to rising supply chain costs and the impact of new tariffs on steel and aluminum—essential materials for the company’s iconic soup cans.

The Rise of the Store Brand: Winners and Losers

While Campbell’s struggles, the primary ""winners"" in the current environment are not its traditional rivals, but rather the retail giants and their private-label brands. As of 2025, store-brand sales reached a record high of $277 billion. Consumers, battered by years of cumulative inflation, have permanently shifted their spending habits. Retailers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) are seeing their ""Great Value"" and ""Kirkland Signature"" lines capture market share that legacy brands like Campbell's may never recover.

In contrast, Campbell’s direct competitors are also feeling the heat. General Mills (NYSE: GIS) and Conagra Brands (NYSE: CAG) have both reported significant volume declines as they attempt to pass on higher costs to a price-sensitive public. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) has fared even worse, announcing a massive plan to split into two independent companies by late 2026 in a desperate bid to unlock value from its aging portfolio. The collective ""Big Food"" sector is currently viewed by investors as a ""value trap,"" with the entire group trading at multi-year lows as they fail to compete with the perceived value and improving quality of generic alternatives.

Broader Industry Trends and the ""War on Sugar""

The decline of Campbell’s fits into a larger, more ominous trend for the packaged food industry. In early 2026, federal regulators introduced aggressive new dietary guidelines that have been colloquially termed the ""War on Sugar and Processed Foods."" These policy shifts have placed a target on the back of any company reliant on highly processed, high-sodium, or sugar-laden products. For Campbell’s, whose portfolio is heavily weighted toward shelf-stable soups and salty snacks like Goldfish, the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly hostile.

Historically, companies like Campbell’s were considered ""recession-proof"" defensive plays. However, the 2025–2026 period has shattered that precedent. The combination of high interest rates, which make the dividend yields of these companies less attractive compared to bonds, and the fundamental shift in consumer health consciousness has removed the traditional safety net. We are seeing a historical pivot similar to the decline of ""Big Tobacco"" in the late 20th century, where legacy giants must either radically reinvent their product lines or face a slow, painful contraction.

Strategic Pivots and the Road Ahead

Looking forward, Campbell’s faces a grueling path to recovery. In the short term, the company is doubling down on a $375 million cost-saving program intended to run through 2028. Investors should expect a series of strategic divestitures as the company looks to trim ""non-core"" brands and focus on its high-margin snacking business. However, with the snacks division itself seeing a 5% organic decline in late 2025, the ""snack-led growth"" thesis is under immense pressure.

One potential scenario is a more aggressive move into the ""fresh"" or ""organic"" categories, though such a pivot would require significant capital expenditure at a time when the company’s balance sheet is already strained. Another possibility is that Campbell’s becomes a target for private equity or a larger conglomerate looking to consolidate the struggling packaged food space. For any turnaround to succeed, the company must first address the reputational damage from the Bally scandal and prove to consumers that its products are compatible with modern health standards.

Final Assessment: A Watchful Eye on the Pantry

The $325,000 stock sale by Charles A. Brawley III may be small in the context of the company’s total market cap, but it serves as a potent symbol of the internal uncertainty plaguing the firm. When the chief legal officer reduces his stake while the stock is at a decade-low, it sends a message that the bottom may not yet be in. The 33% decline over the past year is not merely a market correction; it is a reflection of a company struggling to find its footing in a world that is moving away from the canned-goods era.

Moving forward, investors should watch for the company's Q2 2026 earnings and any further updates on the ""War on Sugar"" regulatory front. The ability of Campbell’s to stabilize its margins in the face of persistent tariff pressures will be the litmus test for its survival as a standalone entity. For now, the ""Mmm-Mmm Good"" era of the 20th century feels like a distant memory, replaced by the harsh reality of a 21st-century retail landscape that demands more than just nostalgia.

In a fast-moving creative industry, knowing when not to rush is a competitive advantage.","Every January, the industry slips into anxiety. Declarations pile up on timelines. You see new strategies, bold announcements, and huge promises. Everyone appears to be “coming back stronger” or “redefining their direction.” Indeed, the volume is remarkable as urgency spreads.

If you have worked long enough in advertising or creative work, a pattern becomes clear. Specifically, the people who move fastest in January rarely shape the year. Urgency often masks nervousness. It reflects the fear of getting left behind. Furthermore, it shows the need to signal progress before substance exists.

The Psychology of the January Rush

January amplifies this feeling because it follows rest and reflection. Silence feels risky. In fact, stillness feels like a loss of relevance. However, experienced creatives understand something different. Creative power does not come from volume. Instead, it comes from orientation.

January is not a month for proof. Rather, it is a month for recalibration. Confidence does not return on its own after time away from clients and deadlines. Consequently, it requires reconnection. The smartest professionals do not rush back into output. They pause and observe. They clean up systems and refine thinking. Ultimately, they realign priorities before acting.

Strategic Patience vs. Speed

This approach does not signal hesitation. Instead, it signals control. In brand work, pressure often looks like ambition. Tight timelines and constant visibility create the illusion that speed equals seriousness. But speed without direction only creates noise. Noise does not create impact.

The creatives who endure focus on structure, not momentum. They revisit ideas that once mattered. They refine concepts developed in haste. Moreover, they strengthen existing relationships instead of chasing new ones. What looks like slowness often reflects strategic patience.

January rewards restraint. This is when professionals set boundaries before calendars fill up. Senior creatives know that January commitments often become mid-year regrets. Therefore, they choose carefully. They do not act from scarcity, but from clarity about capacity. This selectiveness reflects self-awareness, not arrogance.

The Power of Maintenance and Uncertainty

The industry rarely celebrates maintenance. Yet, maintenance preserves creative strength. Teams align systems and simplify processes. They reduce friction before pressure builds. These actions attract no applause, but they compound over time.

Reinvention rarely arrives through grand announcements. Instead, it unfolds through small, deliberate shifts across the year. Respected creatives do not reinvent their identities each January. Rather, they deepen them.

The ability to sit with uncertainty remains an undervalued skill. January often feels unclear. Direction remains fluid. While less experienced creatives rush to escape discomfort through activity, experienced ones allow uncertainty to work. They trust interaction over force.

Building a Competitive Advantage

Ironically, those who resist urgency often move ahead. Their thinking sharpens and their output strengthens. Also, their energy lasts longer. While others chase momentum in January, they quietly build foundations. This marks the difference between starting fast and starting well.

If January feels slower than expected, it may not signal failure. In fact, it may show awareness of energy, craft, and long-term intent. In a fast-moving creative industry, knowing when not to rush is a competitive advantage. The people who thrive rarely shout urgency. Instead, they move with intent.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image_fx-1-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:00:40.607093

The monitor uses next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED technology to improve clarity and reduce fringing. Its ultrawide 21:9 WQHD format, 360 Hz refresh rate, and rapid pixel transitions contribute to fluid motion tracking. HyperX ProLuma extends the panel’s color management capability, while 100 W USB-C power delivery and a built-in KVM switch accommodate multi-device workflows. Users can customize the display further with 3D-printable accessories, such as a headphone hook. HyperX OLED CoreProtect manages panel health during prolonged operation.

The HyperX Clutch Tachi expands HP’s gaming input portfolio with a leverless Xbox-licensed controller. Magnetic switches with TMR sensors support fast actuation, while Ngenuity software enables configuration of button behavior, rapid-trigger adjustments, and personalized layouts. The design also supports 3D-printed modifications for users who want custom button shapes or unique artwork.

HyperX is also collaborating with Neurable to develop a headset that interprets brain activity in real time. This collaboration explores how neurotechnology and AI may support player focus and accuracy during gameplay.

All new HyperX products begin rolling out in the spring, with pricing details scheduled for announcement closer to launch.

What do we think?

Together, HP’s announcements at CES 2026 sketched a clear picture of where the company intends to go next. Its new AI-focused notebooks show a commitment to meeting the practical needs of modern workers who move constantly, depend on local intelligence, and require systems that stay secure and serviceable through heavy daily use. The merger of Omen and HyperX signals a parallel shift in gaming, bringing hardware, peripherals, displays, and software into a single ecosystem shaped around player behavior rather than separate product lines. The new systems and accessories emphasize responsiveness, thermal stability, visual clarity, and deeper personalization, giving both competitive and casual players tools that adapt to their pace. HP’s exploration of neurotechnology through its partnership with Neurable adds another dimension, hinting at experiences that react not just to inputs but to the player’s cognitive state. With these combined efforts, HP moves into 2026 with a unified strategy built around mobility, intelligence, and user-directed design.",https://www.jonpeddie.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hp-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:00:21.466850

On January 7, Michael Yee from UBS initiated coverage of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $1,080 to $1,250. The analyst noted the company’s leadership in the obesity treatment market as one of the key factors behind his bullish sentiment.

The firm highlighted that the company’s performance in 2026 would be driven by the anticipated approval of obesity drug Orfo. The approval of the drug seems imminent as Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) filed for regulatory approval in early December. The firm also believes that the approval could lead the company to exceed Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2026-2028. Moreover, UBS also cited that Medicare coverage for obesity treatments is expected to begin in 2026. This coverage is anticipated to help the company boost adoption of its approved and upcoming obesity treatments.

That said, earlier on January 5, Leerink Partners also raised the price target on the stock from $1,104 to $1,234 and maintained a Buy rating. Leerink Partners also cited the upcoming launch of Orfo as one of the tailwinds boosting the company’s long-term potential.

Today, we are looking at diversified banks stocks, starting with PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC).

At their core, diversified banks take in deposits and engage in various forms of lending, which means revenue is generated through interest rate spreads (difference between loan and deposit rates) and fees. Other revenue comes from adjacent services such as wealth management, card and account fees, and products such as annuities. These institutions benefit from rising interest rates that improve NIMs (net interest margins), digital transformation reducing operational costs, and expanding wealth management services as populations age. However, they face headwinds including fintech competition disrupting traditional models (how disruptive is crypto?), stringent regulatory requirements increasing compliance costs, and cybersecurity threats requiring substantial technology investments. Economic downturns also pose risks through potential loan defaults and compressed margins during accommodative monetary policy periods.

The 7 diversified banks stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.3%.

Luckily, diversified banks stocks have performed well with share prices up 18% on average since the latest earnings results.

Following the transaction close, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. expects to change its name to Callaway Golf Co. within 30 days.
“We expect Callaway will generate consistent free operating cash flow (FOCF) despite the sale of Topgolf.","“Our leverage assessment incorporates a significant reduction in finance and operating lease liabilities associated with separating the Topgolf business, given the limited lease exposure of the company’s remaining core operations. In addition, all deemed landlord financing obligations and venue-level financing liabilities related to Topgolf are expected to transfer with that business.

“The sale of Topgolf reduces the scale, profitability level, and diversification of stand-alone Callaway. We forecast total consolidated sales of approximately $2.1 billion in 2026, compared with approximately $3.9 billion in 2025 for the combined entity, reflecting the divestitures of both Jack Wolfskin and Topgolf. Therefore, we revised our assessment of the company’s business risk profile to weak from fair.

“Despite the reduction in absolute scale, we expect the company’s golf equipment and apparel segments to demonstrate stable demand trends, supporting low-single-digit percent year-over-year revenue growth for stand-alone Callaway. We anticipate elevated tariff-related input costs will partially pressure profitability, limiting margin expansion. As a result, we forecast S&P Global Ratings–adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 12.0% in 2026 and 12.2% in 2027, corresponding to adjusted EBITDA of roughly $255 million and $265 million, respectively.

“Callaway has repositioned its operating model as a pure-play golf equipment and apparel company focused on its core product offerings. Callaway has simplified its business model following the divestiture of its Topgolf entertainment segment. By exiting a capital-intensive, venue-based operating model, the company is concentrating on its traditional strengths in golf equipment and active lifestyle products, which should simplify operations and improve visibility into earnings and cash flow. The remaining portfolio consists of Callaway Golf, Odyssey, TravisMathew, and OGIO, representing established brands with market recognition and pricing power across golf clubs, balls, apparel, and accessories.

“In our view, this streamlined structure enhances management’s ability to prioritize product innovation, control costs, and allocate capital more efficiently. It also reduces exposure to discretionary entertainment spending and execution risk associated with physical venue expansion. Following the transaction close, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. expects to change its name to Callaway Golf Co. within 30 days.

“We expect Callaway will generate consistent free operating cash flow (FOCF) despite the sale of Topgolf. As of the end of the third quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2025), the company had roughly $866 million of cash on hand and $427 million available across its U.S and international asset-based lending (ABL) facilities. We project the stand-alone Callaway will generate reported FOCF of around $150 million annually after capital expenditure (capex) of about $40 million–a steep reduction in capital spending compared with $300 million for the former combined entity. We expect most of its capex will fund technology investments, improve existing stores, and support expansion. The company does not face any near-term maturities, with its ABL facilities maturing in 2028 and its term loan facility maturing in 2030.

“The positive outlook reflects our view that we could raise our ratings on Callaway over the next 12 months if we expect S&P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage sustained below 2x.”",,N,,2026-01-09 14:03:09.991932

The reaffirmed positive sentiment from analysts has arrived alongside solid recent momentum, with a 90 day share price return of 26.49% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 42.68%, suggesting interest in Parker Hannifin’s long term potential is building.

With the shares up strongly over the past year, trading around $906.47 and sitting only a few percent below an average analyst price target, the key question now is simple: is Parker Hannifin still undervalued, or is the market already factoring in the next leg of growth?

Compared with the last close at $906.47, the most followed narrative sees fair value closer to $907.86, with that view resting on specific growth, margin and valuation assumptions.

Introduction

In the volatile world of global fashion, few brands have successfully navigated the treacherous transition from ubiquitous department-store apparel to genuine luxury prestige. As of early 2026, Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) stands as the preeminent example of this ""premiumization"" masterclass. While many of its North American peers have struggled with brand dilution and heavy discounting, Ralph Lauren has spent the last five years executing a disciplined ""Next Great Chapter"" strategy that has fundamentally re-rated the stock in the eyes of Wall Street. Today, the company is no longer viewed merely as a maker of polo shirts, but as a lifestyle titan with significant pricing power and an expanding footprint in the high-growth Asian markets. With the stock trading near all-time highs and a new three-year strategic plan currently in its first year of implementation, RL remains one of the most compelling narratives in the consumer discretionary sector.

Historical Background

The Ralph Lauren story began in 1967 with a single collection of men’s ties, sold under the ""Polo"" label by a young entrepreneur with no formal fashion training. Ralph Lauren’s vision was never just about clothing; it was about the ""American Dream""—an aspirational mix of Ivy League tradition, English aristocracy, and Western ruggedness. The company expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 80s, becoming the first American designer to open a free-standing boutique on New York’s Madison Avenue.

The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997. For much of the early 2000s, Ralph Lauren expanded its reach through extensive licensing and a heavy reliance on wholesale partners like Macy’s (NYSE: M). However, this strategy eventually led to brand over-exposure and excessive discounting. The turning point arrived in 2017 with the appointment of Patrice Louvet, a veteran from Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), who partnered with the founder to initiate a radical multi-year transformation aimed at elevating the brand and reclaiming its luxury status.

Business Model

Ralph Lauren operates a vertically integrated business model that balances global scale with localized agility. The company’s revenue is generated through three primary channels:

Direct-to-Consumer (DTC): This is the core of the company’s modern strategy, comprising owned retail stores and a robust e-commerce platform. In late 2025, DTC accounted for nearly two-thirds of total revenue, up significantly from previous years.

Wholesale: This includes sales to premier department stores and specialty retailers. The company has deliberately reduced its wholesale footprint—particularly in ""off-price"" channels—to preserve brand equity.

Licensing: While smaller in terms of direct revenue, licensing allows the brand to extend into lifestyle categories like fragrances, eyewear, and home furnishings through partnerships with experts in those fields.

Geographically, Ralph Lauren is a global powerhouse. While North America remains its largest market, Europe and Asia (particularly Greater China) have become the primary engines of margin-accretive growth, with Asia now representing the most profitable segment on a per-unit basis.

Stock Performance Overview

Ralph Lauren has been a standout performer in the ""post-pandemic"" era, delivering exceptional returns for shareholders who recognized its structural shift early.

1-Year Performance: Over the past twelve months, RL has gained approximately 58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and the broader retail index.

5-Year Performance: Investors who bought in 2021 have seen their holdings nearly triple. The stock’s rally accelerated in late 2024 as the market began to reward RL's consistent earnings beats and margin expansion.

10-Year Performance: On a decade-long horizon, the stock reflects the ""V-shaped"" recovery of the brand—from a period of stagnation in 2015-2017 to a powerhouse trajectory starting in late 2022. As of January 2026, RL is trading near $360, up from the sub-$100 levels seen during the depths of the 2020 market cycle.

Financial Performance

PredictStreet’s analysis of Ralph Lauren’s most recent fiscal results (ending mid-2025) reveals a company operating at peak efficiency.

Revenue Growth: Fiscal year 2025 revenue reached $7.10 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year. This growth was notably achieved despite a deliberate 10% reduction in sales to off-price wholesale channels.

Operating Margins: Adjusted operating margins climbed to 14.0% in 2025, a 150-basis-point expansion from the prior year. This was driven by a cumulative 60% increase in Average Unit Retail (AUR) over the last five years.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company reported adjusted EPS of $12.33 in 2025, a 20% increase over 2024.

Balance Sheet: Ralph Lauren maintains a fortress balance sheet with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and a net cash position. This liquidity has supported a consistent dividend and aggressive share buybacks, totaling over $600 million in the last fiscal year.

Leadership and Management

The leadership at Ralph Lauren is defined by a unique partnership between creative vision and operational discipline.

Patrice Louvet (President & CEO): Louvet has been the architect of the brand’s financial turnaround. His ""Next Great Chapter"" plans have prioritized digital transformation, marketing ROI, and geographic optimization.

Ralph Lauren (Executive Chairman & Chief Creative Officer): At 86, the founder remains the soul of the company. He continues to oversee every creative aspect of the brand, ensuring that the ""lifestyle"" narrative remains coherent across all product lines.

Justin Picicci (CFO): Appointed in 2024, Picicci has maintained a strict focus on inventory management and capital allocation, earning him high marks from the analyst community.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Ralph Lauren’s product strategy is built on a ""tiered"" architecture that captures the full spectrum of the luxury market:

Luxury Pinnacle: The Purple Label and Ralph Lauren Collection (Women’s) compete with the likes of Hermes and Loro Piana. These lines have seen double-digit growth as the ""quiet luxury"" trend remains a dominant force in 2026.

Core Polo: The Polo Ralph Lauren brand has been successfully elevated, with a focus on icons like the cable-knit sweater and the Oxford shirt.

Category Expansion: The ""Next Great Chapter: Drive"" plan, launched in late 2025, focuses on expanding underpenetrated high-margin categories, specifically handbags, outerwear, and home decor.

Innovation: The company has integrated AI into its supply chain to predict demand at a hyper-local level, reducing markdowns and improving full-price sell-through rates.

Competitive Landscape

In the current market, Ralph Lauren is increasingly compared to European luxury conglomerates rather than its traditional American rivals.

vs. PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH): While PVH (owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein) has struggled with wholesale reliance in North America, RL has pivoted more aggressively to DTC.

vs. Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) and Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI): Tapestry (Coach) and Capri (Michael Kors) have focused on ""accessible luxury,"" which has proven more susceptible to macro-economic headwinds. Ralph Lauren’s more diversified lifestyle brand and higher price points have shielded it from the volatility seen by these handbag-centric firms.

Market Share: RL has successfully gained share in the ""premium menswear"" and ""luxury sportswear"" categories, particularly in Western Europe and the Tier-1 cities of China.

Industry and Market Trends

Several macro trends are currently favoring the Ralph Lauren business model:

Brand Elevation/Quiet Luxury: The shift away from loud logos toward timeless, high-quality garments plays directly into Ralph Lauren’s core aesthetic.

Asian Middle-Class Growth: Despite broader macro concerns in China, the demand for ""classic Americana"" remains robust among the Chinese upper-middle class, where RL is perceived as a top-tier aspirational brand.

Digital/Physical Integration: The ""Win in Key Cities"" strategy uses flagship ""World of Ralph Lauren"" stores (including Ralph’s Coffee shops) to drive both physical and digital sales within a 50-mile radius, a model that has significantly boosted customer lifetime value.

Risks and Challenges

Despite the current momentum, several risks remain:

Macro-Economic Sensitivity: A significant global recession would likely dampen demand for even premium luxury goods, particularly in the ""Lauren"" and ""Polo"" segments which have more exposure to aspirational (vs. ultra-high-net-worth) consumers.

Tariff and Trade Policy: With evolving US trade policies in 2025 and 2026, any major increase in tariffs on goods from Asia could pressure gross margins, although the company has diversified its sourcing away from China (now less than 20% of production).

Succession Planning: While the company has a deep bench of professional talent, the eventual departure of Ralph Lauren himself—whose personal brand is inextricably linked to the company—poses a long-term narrative risk.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Looking forward to the remainder of 2026 and 2027, several catalysts could drive further upside:

Handbag Penetration: Handbags currently represent a small fraction of RL’s revenue compared to peers like Coach or Gucci. The 2025 launch of the ""RL 888"" and ""Polo ID"" collections represents a major push into this high-margin category.

China Recovery: If the Chinese economy sees a broader stimulus-led recovery in 2026, RL is better positioned than almost any other US retailer to capture that upside.

Earnings Consistency: The company has a multi-year streak of beating analyst estimates. Continued execution of the ""Drive"" strategy (FY26-FY28) targets another 100-150 bps of margin expansion.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Sentiment on Wall Street is overwhelmingly positive. As of January 9, 2026, a majority of analysts covering RL maintain a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" rating.

Price Targets: Recent targets from major institutions range from $400 to $435, suggesting a 10-20% upside from current levels.

Institutional Activity: There has been a notable increase in institutional ownership from ""quality"" and ""growth"" oriented funds over the last 18 months, shifting away from the ""value"" funds that previously dominated the shareholder base.

PredictStreet View: Our AI-generated earnings models suggest RL is well-positioned to exceed the consensus EPS of $13.50 for the current fiscal year, driven by stronger-than-expected holiday performance and continued AUR growth.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Ralph Lauren is navigating a complex regulatory environment:

ESG and Sustainability: The company is under increasing pressure from EU regulations regarding textile recycling and supply chain transparency. RL has committed to 100% sustainably sourced key materials by 2030, a goal that requires significant R&D investment.

Geopolitics: The ""China+1"" sourcing strategy is nearly complete, with increased production in Vietnam, India, and Turkey, mitigating the risk of sudden geopolitical shifts in East Asia.

Conclusion

Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) has successfully navigated the most difficult era in modern retail by doubling down on brand heritage while modernizing its operational backbone. By choosing to sell fewer items at higher prices and focusing on direct relationships with consumers, management has transformed the company from a cyclical apparel play into a structural luxury winner.

For investors, RL represents a rare combination of top-line growth, margin expansion, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. While the stock's valuation is no longer ""cheap"" by historical standards, it remains attractive relative to European luxury peers and reflects a business that is fundamentally more profitable and resilient than it was a decade ago. Investors should watch for the upcoming Q3 earnings report (February 2026) for confirmation that the ""Drive"" strategic plan is delivering on its handbag and outerwear expansion goals.

(NG) announces that Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), which is owned 60% by NOVAGOLD and 40% by Paulson Advisers LLC (“Paulson”), and Glenfarne Alaska LNG, LLC (“Glenfarne”), majority owner and developer of the Alaska LNG Project (“Alaska LNG”), signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for natural gas supply from the Alaska LNG Pipeline and the development of the infrastructure needed to deliver the gas and power the proposed mine.

Under the LOI, Glenfarne and Donlin Gold will continue to evaluate ways to formalize a potential natural gas sales agreement for up to 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and cooperate on the most effective method for development and construction of the Donlin Gold natural gas pipeline. The pipeline extends from Southcentral Alaska to the Donlin Gold project in Southwest Alaska and will feed a power plant to supply electricity to the proposed mine.

“A reliable, secure supply of economic natural gas from Alaska LNG has the potential to substantially enhance our ability to unlock value and upside potential in Donlin Gold,” said John Paulson, President of Paulson. “Glenfarne’s global energy experience is well-suited to provide a long-term turnkey energy solution that helps advance this opportunity.”

“Powering Donlin Gold with natural gas from Alaska LNG could offer major advantages for the proposed mine and the Southwestern Alaska region by harnessing the strategic potential of such an important gold endowment for the industry and the United States,” said Greg Lang, NOVAGOLD’s President and CEO. “Aligning Alaska LNG and Donlin Gold’s pipeline schedules could reduce fuel costs, optimize transportation and logistics, streamline material procurement, and leverage shared expertise to lower overall project expenses.”

“Alaska LNG offers abundant low-cost natural gas that will enhance the economics and facilitate development of energy-intensive mining projects in Alaska,” said Glenfarne Alaska LNG President Adam Prestidge. “We have great confidence in the future success of Donlin Gold following the significant investment by Paulson. Adding a foundational customer like Donlin Gold, one of the largest known undeveloped gold deposits in the world, Alaska LNG provides significant volume discount benefits that will result in lower energy costs for Alaska consumers. As we continue to add more pipeline customers, the cost of gas for Alaskans will continue to go down.”

Donlin Gold Natural Gas Pipeline & Permitting

As per the 2021 Technical Report (as defined below) and the S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary (as defined below), Donlin Gold envisions a buried, 316-mile natural gas pipeline from an existing 20-inch natural gas pipeline near Beluga, Alaska to the Donlin Gold mine site to supply reliable, lower-carbon emitting, energy for mining operations. Key federal and state permits for the pipeline route have been issued. Recently the State of Alaska Supreme Court upheld the Alaska Department Natural Resources issuance of the pipeline right-of-way lease. Supplemental environmental review is ongoing under the Fixing America’s Transportation Act (“FAST-41”) program, coordinated by the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leading a court-directed Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement.

Donlin Gold Bankable Feasibility Study Update

Donlin Gold continues to advance the selection of a prime contractor for the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS), having received proposals from leading engineering firms with the expertise required to design what is expected to be the largest single gold mine in the United States. A prime contractor is expected to be selected in the first quarter of 2026. In parallel, requests for proposals have been issued for specialist contractors covering the power plant, pipeline, and pressure oxidation and oxygen plant scopes of work, which will be incorporated into the BFS. Upon completion of the contractor selection process, a detailed timeline and budget for completion of the BFS will be established. Final construction approvals remain subject to completion of the environmental review, permitting, and the BFS.

The company has more than 120 years of history in lighting, under parent company Signify, formerly Philips Lighting and Philips. Now, Genlyte is the maker of a wide scope of professional lighting—from office and retail projects to Broadway shows to illuminating monumental landmarks.

Kevin Poyck, president and CEO of the Bridgewater, New Jersey-based unit spoke with Chief Executive to share the company’s roots and its strategy for moving forward.

Tell us about Signify’s Genlyte Solutions business, your history and how the company has grown.

Genlyte Solutions, a Signify business, has a 120-plus year legacy of lighting innovation and manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Mexico and Central America. We are committed to unlocking the extraordinary potential of light for professional customers in the region.

Our collection of cutting-edge indoor and outdoor luminaires, LED lamps and electronics, and connected lighting systems and controls are designed to enhance well-being and performance, elevate experiences and advance sustainability—supporting brighter lives and a better world.

Among our trusted brands are Color Kinetics, which illuminates prominent buildings, bridges and landmarks; Vari-Lite, which lights concert tours, theater productions and large-scale entertainment events; and Philips, known for its high-quality and energy-efficient LED lamps.

To offer a bit of history: Signify is the world leader in lighting for professional and consumer customers. The company, founded as Philips in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, has led the lighting industry since 1891. Following the separation from Philips in 2016, we are now known as Signify.

Genlyte is a professional lighting business, focused on the North American market. Genlyte is fully responsible for its end-to-end processes including offer development, manufacturing, sales and marketing. The Genlyte name is not new to the company or lighting and electrical industries. Many of our luminaire brands come from Philips’ acquisition of Genlyte Group in 2008.

Over the last two years, our focus has been on distinguishing the Genlyte business and re-establishing our brands’ identities in the market given their strong legacies. We continue to strengthen our selling partnerships and invest, for example, in our digital capabilities, so we can best support our customers—along every stage of their project.

What do your U.S. manufacturing operations look like?

Genlyte operates three manufacturing facilities: two in Pennsylvania—a factory in Littlestown and a foundry in New Oxford—as well as a factory in Dallas, Texas.

Our Littlestown facility is best known for its production of our Hadco urban outdoor and landscape lighting solutions. We also manufacture at this site a robust portfolio of indoor and outdoor lighting products that meet domestic preference requirements, in line with the Build America, Buy America Act and Buy American Act.

In addition, Littlestown has become the manufacturing hub of our 3D printed lighting portfolio, encompassing decorative pendants, high and low bays, tracks and downlight accessories veracious under Genlyte’s Lightolier and Day-Brite CFI brands.

3D printing, as a manufacturing method, offers numerous benefits. The technology gives our customers the freedom to create their own unique designs, whether to suit a specific brand experience or space, in a timely and cost-effective manner. It supports a circular economy and sustainability; we use recyclable and bio-based materials and even waste like fishing nets.

Compared to traditional luminaires, 3D printed lighting fixtures don’t use paint or glue, and require fewer parts and screws, so they can be easily disassembled for reuse. Plus, they are produced on demand, reducing lead times, limiting waste and preventing large stock storage.

In our Dallas facility, we design and manufacture our Vari-Lite moving lights for the entertainment industry, along with control and power systems for theatres. These products make their way to Broadway productions, school and university theaters, and on tour with global artists.

Our people are at the heart of our U.S., and entire North America, manufacturing operations. Their health and well-being are our top priorities; we have strong programs in place to drive a safety culture. We invest in continuous learning and development, as well, so we build on our strong legacy while leading, challenging and shaping the future—for our business, Signify, the industry and the world we live in.

How about your operations in Canada and elsewhere?

Genlyte operates two manufacturing facilities in Canada: in Boisbriand, Quebec, home to our Lumec outdoor lighting brand; and in Langley, British Colombia, home to our Ledalite indoor architectural lighting brand. Both surpassed milestone anniversaries—50 and 40 years, respectively.

We also have two manufacturing facilities in Mexico—in Camargo, Chihuahua and in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon—as well as a robust regional distribution center network across North America with ready-made lighting stock available.

There are several other foundational elements to our manufacturing operations, one being our lean capabilities. Our sites are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to improve the level of quality and service we are delivering to our customers. So much so, Signify hosts an annual, global competition in which teams share their lean best practices and encourage replication throughout the entire company.

Another is sustainability. Our sustainable operations program focuses on reducing our carbon footprint. We employ energy-efficiency measures, including using 100 percent renewable energy. We also strive to minimize the amount of manufacturing waste that ends up in landfills; we achieved our commitment of sending zero waste to landfill at the end of 2024. We also engage with our suppliers and logistics and transport partners to drive their own emissions reductions.

How do you navigate a U.S.-Canada-Mexico business given today’s trade challenges?

It has never been more important to ensure that you have several contingency plans in place and to build a diversified footprint. With Signify being a global company, Genlyte has the benefit of using this reach to our advantage.

These steps have enabled us to adapt to the changing trade environment and mitigate short-term impacts as much as possible. We have, and continue to, assess developments as they unfold, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers and staying in close communication with them.

What’s next for Genlyte?

Lighting is an industry in the fast lane. It’s going through several different waves of transformation concurrently, which is exciting for our business.

The first is the shift to LED. While virtually every new construction project incorporates LED lighting and controls, there is still a big opportunity to upgrade existing buildings to high-performance technologies. Genlyte continues to bring new, ultra-efficient LED products to the market, to help our customers realize greater energy savings and quicker ROI.

Connected lighting systems, complemented with tailored lighting services, is a growing business. This can enable cities and businesses to realize even greater efficiency and value, with precise control over their lighting assets and energy use and the ability to extract actionable insights—whether for driving operational efficiency or supporting the well-being and performance of citizens or building occupants.

And now we are seeing another transition, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. It is being applied to speed up lighting design processes and support customers’ product searches and quoting, so we can efficiently manufacture and deliver their projects.

Genlyte is committed to supporting our customers, no matter what “wave” they’re at. Our strategy focuses on delivering exceptional service, making it easy for them to get the custom lighting solutions they need, when they need it. The future looks bright and connected.",https://chiefexecutive.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kevin-Poyck-1.webp,N,,2026-01-09 14:02:31.247915

One could’ve easily sold bred heifers and replaced with the 5-year-old breds, selling $160 value into the market and getting paid $1,100 for it.","The top consultants in our industry have told me the reason my schools are the best is because I have chosen my “therapy” over everything else. What they mean is there is enough demand for me to do a school every month somewhere, but I have chosen to stay home to raise cattle and execute sell/buy trades earning money the same way I have for nearly 30 years. I enjoy the day-to-day tasks and going to auctions, which is now a welcome break from everything else in my life, which is why they now call it therapy.

I wasn’t in a good head space yesterday and must have felt I needed more time in my session. Despite the wind and the rain, I sat on the fence at the sale barn I was at and watched the sale barn cowboys load out trucks. Two things came to me.

I realized no one can criticize anything I do there. Sure, some will try, and quickly get put in their place. Thing is they have no clue what my numbers are telling me. Some have tried to lay claim to my success. They have no right since they didn’t have any skin in anything I’ve done. I also have no one to blame but myself. My only restraint is my numbers, and that is only because I am committed to making prosperous trades.

Some people don’t like auctions referring to it as a snake pit. My previous paragraph almost makes it sound like a safe space. Self-reflection is becoming a big thing for me. I’ve learned how things work and my perception is different.

My second thought was I should be used to being copied and maybe I should be flattered. Truth is it still makes me cringe, because no one respects a coat tail rider. If some in ag media, or even the education space, were sitting where I was on that fence in the rain with manure on their boots, they might be able to come up with their own original material, instead of relying on me.

Livestock haulers essential despite media calls for restrictions

Some in ag media have shared with me they think livestock haulers should have more restrictions and requirements. I will not hesitate to snap back at them they have no clue what they just said because it would crash our whole system.

I’ll save my rant, but here’s where I am going with this. If these people got their wish bull haulers would quit. Then what? Markets wouldn’t exist if we didn’t have a way to quickly transport the stock.

I think it makes sense that we need to support these people who haul livestock, instead of making things more difficult for them. The size and location of the operation doesn’t matter for this subject. At some point after the animal is sold it will take the ten-lug ride. Commerce in this industry has always been dependent on wheels. It used to be steel wheels under trains, now its 22 tires.

Weight gain business signals clear through feeder auction results

Feeder auctions sent the crystal-clear signal this is a weight gain business. Early in the week there was a leapfrog between five and six weight steers, but later in the week that got covered up.

This week feeder bulls were up to 70 back, and unweaned calves were up to 20 back. Replacement quality heifers caught a 20-dollar premium, and load lots caught one of 10 in places.

Geographical spreads were huge this week. Comparing certain weights against each other it could easily double the return on the gain, compared to buying close to home. Good thing the bull haulers don’t have all those restrictions to make this trade possible and keep the market afloat in those other states.

Cattle quality determines market success over breeder preferences

The last couple weeks I have witnessed people get upset their cattle didn’t sell well. We must sell something other people want to buy for it to sell well. A couple weeks ago I was the co bidder on some black hided, smooth headed steers that came out of a bucking stock program. These sold right at the top of the market. Time and time again, clubbie influenced cattle struggle to reach half the price the plain cattle sell for, with some not even getting a bid and being passed out as no value. If we are going to throw a fit about this on sale day remember that when ordering the straws this spring.

Breeding stock is the same way. No one wants thin cows, or small heifers. Some buyers will flat ignore certain consignments because of what they are bred to. What breed the female is will also matter to some buyers.

Female cattle depreciation patterns contradict popular industry advice

The female sale I kept tabs on looked like this. Bred heifers were the bellringers of bred stock. There was a $600 price drop for 3-4-year-olds. Then another price drop of $500 for 5-7-year-olds. Then any cow older than that was only $100 back from 5-7’s. Look where the depreciation actually happened.

The only pairs in the offering were in that 5-7-year-old range. They were over-valued to bred cows of the same age, and if the cow was bred back the 3 in 1 was worth $450 more.

Real market experience beats theoretical education and podcasting

We hear noise about deflecting depreciation and capturing appreciation. Again, these people should’ve been sitting where I was. The only two trades that work against open heifers were to sell the pairs, or bred heifers, and replace with opens.

One could’ve easily sold bred heifers and replaced with the 5-year-old breds, selling $160 value into the market and getting paid $1,100 for it. This is a better trade than swapping out for open heifers, especially since there was $1,500 value capture for having the calf at side, which gives us time value of money as well!

The previous paragraph just told readers about another great trade, 5-7-year-old pairs to breds of the same age. This sells $400 value into the market while getting paid almost $1,500 for it.

Isn’t that something, the cow the educators and podcasters tell us to sell was the best buy.

The view from the seats and drover’s alley is different and offers clarity. Now the joke is these sessions do not require insurance and are free, until we buy something.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt2e0568960277f8ae/69610c3c26eb620516aab1a0/Doug_Fergusonbeef_column.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 10:01:35.863535

Also, be sure to check out our list of the best CES tech we saw this year at the show.

Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum

Robot vacuums can be a little unsettling already, but Dreame’s Cyber X takes it up a level by sprouting chunky treaded “legs” and hauling itself up a full staircase like a tiny cleaning tank. In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.

OlloBot

CES loves a companion robot, but OlloBot might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.

ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo

Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect. The Zephyrus Duo uses a detachable keyboard and a built-in kickstand so you can stack screens, spread out, or generally arrange your portable battle station however you like. It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.

Throne toilet computer

Throne is a toilet-mounted computer that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.

Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad

Vivoo looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized. Alongside its clip-on smart toilet that analyzes your hydration by literally monitoring your pee, the company also unveiled a menstrual pad infused with microfluidics that can track fertility and hormone markers once you scan it with your phone. It’s a bold reminder that CES 2026 is fully committed to quantifying everything — even the stuff we’d rather not discuss over brunch.

Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable

Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable is what happens when a gaming laptop decides it wants to be a widescreen monitor mid-match. Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.

Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable

If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the ThinkBook XD Rollable is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.

OhDoki Handy 2 Pro

OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.

iPolish

iPolish finally made Total Recall nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.

Hisense S6 FollowMe display

Despite the name, Hisense’s FollowMe doesn’t actually follow you at all. It’s a 32-inch 4K smart display on wheels that you manually drag from room to room, delivering strong TV-and-VCR-on-a-cart energy, just with Wi-Fi 6, a built-in camera, far-field mics and a 10-hour battery. It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.

GE Profile Smart Fridge

If you’ve ever bought a “just in case” bag of spinach and discovered three more at home, GE’s latest smart fridge wants to be your grocery reality check. A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required. The AI bits are mostly there to answer practical questions like “Where’s my water filter?” which is the most convincing argument we’ve heard for putting a voice assistant on a fridge.

The Big Question What is your go-to escapist car film/book/tv show?","The confluence of politics and cars has been a little exhausting lately. Honestly, the confluence of politics with everything is overwhelming what few circuitbreakers I have left in my psyche. That’s why I’m glad that, today of all days, the car news is a little slow and boring, so I can provide a little bit of good news.

A new Jackass movie is coming this summer! Johnny Knoxville, Wee Man, and… other people, I’m sure, will be back. It’s been far too long, and while I don’t think it’ll mend all of America’s tears, maybe it’ll distract us long enough to remember we’re all part of the same fabric. And also, it’s fun to watch people do dumb things with cars.

Because CES is going on, there’s still a lot of talk about self-driving, and Ford’s made a kind of surprising announcement. Lucid and Uber made an announcement, but I’m less surprised by it, as it seems obvious.

And, finally, Volvo has a car that plans to fight range anxiety.

Who Is Ready For Jackass This Summer?

A post shared by Johnny Knoxville (@johnnyknoxville)

We did three film festivals at Jalopnik, and the last one was the biggest and also my least favorite. It got too big because we got more than a million dollars for it, and the more money you take, the more you gotta do. It had some great moments, including showing the documentary about car culture in Cuba, Havana Motor Club (a couple of participants in the film were on hand and may have done some hilarious thing with a reader’s AMG wagon…).

In retrospect, the film order was all wrong. We started the day with Mad Max and then transitioned into Being Evel, the Johnny Knoxville-helmed doc about Evel Knievel, finishing with our big “get,” which was the North American premiere of Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans. This was a doc about the making of the Le Mans film and, like the film it’s based on, it was good, not great.

I hadn’t even seen Being Evel; it was just available, so we tossed it in the lineup. My bad! It’s fantastic. As someone who has made a couple of documentaries since, I’m overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness. The McQueen documentary has a hard time resolving the fact that its subject was a deeply flawed person, clearly fearful that it would make the project itself not worth making if it fully acknowledged McQueen’s behavior. Hagiography is a bit like gastroenterology in that they’re both primarily consumed with making difficult shit disappear.

Being Evel directly confronts the person of Evel Knievel and doesn’t pull any punches, which somehow doesn’t make you care less about his accomplishments.

This is all to say that I think if you look with any scrutiny at Johnny Knoxville’s body of work, the most consistent feature is a remarkable consciousness. A large percentage of his oeuvre is dedicated to people getting hit in the nuts or turning their pink torpedoes into beehives or whatever, but none of it feels like punching down. That seems impossible.

The last Jackass project was in 2022, with the film Jackass Forever. Not everyone from the original MTV prank show was there for reasons both tragic and litigious, but it felt like it came at exactly the right time. According to a new post from Johnny Knoxville, a new Jackass film is coming this summer.

Given everything else in the world, I think a few of us might need this. Watching someone fired like a projectile out of a piece of artillery or slammed in the nards with a pumelo isn’t going to fix everything, or anything, but I welcome the distraction.

Just leave the poor Ford Contours alone!

Ford Thinks It’s Going To Catch Up To GM’s Eye-Free Driving With Its Cheapest EV

Ok, this one got me. In the self-driving space, we’ve been sort of stuck at Level 2, so people keep inventing their own SAE labels like “Level 2++” or FSD. Essentially, no one is willing to commit to Level 3 because, seemingly, the handoff between driver and passenger feels harder at 75 mph if the driver is, say, asleep.

Mercedes announced its FSD-like Level 2 system this week, and GM has said it’ll bring “eyes-off driving” to the super expensive Cadillac Escalade IQ for highways in 2028. Ford said it’ll match its crosstown rival with Level 2 in 2027 on its cheapest vehicle and then L3 in 2028.

Doug Field, the company’s head of all things technological and EV, said this:

Autonomy shouldn’t be a premium feature. By designing our own software and hardware in-house, we’ve found a way to make this technology more affordable. This means we can put advanced hands-free driving into the vehicles people actually buy, not just vehicles with unattainable price points. With 1.2 million BlueCruise-equipped vehicles already on the road, we are able to learn from real-world miles to continuously improve the experience for our customers.

Just as important, we’re focused on efficiency — delivering more capability, not just sheer processing power. Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable.

We plan to introduce new hardware and software, thanks to our in-house teams, starting in 2027 on our all-new, affordable Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform. And we aren’t stopping at hands-free driving; building on this same flexible foundation, L3 eyes-off driving will be road ready in 2028, making the ultimate in-vehicle experience available for the many, not just a privileged few

It sounds like, then, Ford and GM will debut systems at roughly the same time, but the difference is that it’ll be on Ford’s Skunkworks truck or other cheap EV, and for GM, it’ll start out on the Escalade IQ.

Uber And Lucid Are Doing A Thing

It’s been clear for a long time that Uber’s long-term goal is to get rid of drivers, although the path to this has been rocky. Uber initially partnered with Volvo on a self driving program that resulted in the first self-driving fatality.

Uber is trying again in the United States, this time with a robotaxi based on the Lucid Gravity. That car is arguably the best three-row anything for sale right now, so that’s not a bad place to start. How big the market is for three-row EVs remains to be seen, but this seems like a good use of the company’s growing production capacity.

The company says the taxis are already testing in San Francisco, and a production-intent version will go into production later this year, featuring tech from Nuro.

From Lucid:

“The debut of our production intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale,” said Dave Ferguson, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Nuro. “By bringing together Nuro’s proven level 4 autonomy, Lucid’s advanced vehicle architecture, and Uber’s global reach, we’re building a robotaxi service designed for real-world operations and long-term growth.”

“Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Global Head of Autonomous Mobility & Delivery at Uber. “By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we’re building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.”

As with Waymo, but unlike Tesla, this system uses Lidar.

The Volvo EX60 Gets 400 Miles Of Range

A new Volvo compact crossover EV is coming in the form of the Volvo EX60. The company is very excited about the 400 miles of range and charging time:

“The EX60 is designed to be a gamechanger,” says Anders Bell, Chief Technology Officer at Volvo Cars. “With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety.”

The EX60 does not only boast the longest range of any fully electric Volvo, it also charges faster than any electric Volvo before in all weather conditions. Instead of a full lunch break, a quick coffee stop is now enough to recharge the battery and hit the road again.

Fun fact, when someone says something is going to be a “gamechanger” it is not going to change any games. It used to be that 300 miles was the gold standard of EVs, but for luxury EVs, I think it’s probably been surpassed. 400 is the new 300, you heard it here first.

Multiple analysts have raised their price targets on shares this week as Delta (DAL) kicks off earnings for airline stocks early next week.

Southwest Stock Southwest shares surged 4.4% Friday to break out above a 43.54 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.
Delta stock gained 1.6% Friday.","Southwest Airlines broke out early Friday after receiving a double upgrade from JPMorgan. Multiple analysts have raised their price targets on shares this week as Delta (DAL) kicks off earnings for airline stocks early next week. Other airline stocks rose early Friday.

JPMorgan on Friday upgraded Southwest Airlines (LUV) to overweight from underweight and hiked its price target on LUV stock to 60 from 36, The Fly reported. The firm said that the potential for a $5 earnings-per-share outlook for 2026 is ""attractively probable,"" and such a guidance would ""handily dwarf"" the $2.98 consensus estimate. It added that Southwest's core business was starting to stabilize and its initiatives, such as bag fees and seat assignments, are progressing.

Southwest reports its results on Jan. 29. FactSet expects Southwest to report a 1 cent increase in earnings to 57 cents per share on 5% decline in revenue.

The double upgrade comes after Morgan Stanley on Thursday raised its price target on Southwest from 48 to 50. The report noted that airlines have sounded very positive about underlying demand trends. However, Q4 will likely be ""another noisy quarter"" to cap off a ""write-off year"" for airlines. Still, the ""tone may be different"" despite the noise. The firm kept an overweight rating on LUV stock.

UBS on Tuesday said that the setup heading into earnings season appears favorable. The firm expects bullish outlooks for Q1 and 2026, driven by rebounding demand, modest Q1 capacity growth, easing fuel prices and easier demand comparisons starting in February.

UBS raised its price target on LUV stock to 45 from 43 and kept a neutral rating on the shares.

Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines reports Q4 results on Tuesday. FactSet analysts expect earnings will fall 17% to $1.53 per share on 4% revenue growth to $14.7 billion.

Delta in its Q3 report said it expects earnings to range from $1.60 to $1.90 per share on 2% to 4% revenue growth. CEO Ed Bastian in October said that Q4 could potentially be ""the best fourth-quarter performance in our history.""

Southwest Stock

Southwest shares surged 4.4% Friday to break out above a 43.54 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.

The four-weeks-tight pattern, a follow-on buying opportunity, took shape after Southwest broke out of a six-month cup base in early December.

Southwest stock is trading near its highest price since June 2022.

American Airlines (AAL) swung 3.5% higher Friday morning. United Airlines (UAL) rose more than 2% to advance out of a buy zone.

Delta stock gained 1.6% Friday.

At CES 2026, HP Inc. is highlighting its growing problems, which are being faced by professionals worldwide: workplace stress and low job satisfaction. As per HP’s research, only 20 per cent of knowledge workers currently have a healthy relationship with work. The company believes this can change with the right mix of AI-driven tools, flexible devices and employee-first technology. When companies invest in modern technology, employee satisfaction and productivity rise significantly — a message that strongly resonates with India’s rapidly growing hybrid workforce.

HP has rolled out a bunch of new devices and platforms aimed at making hybrid work, creativity, and business growth a little easier.

1. HP EliteBoard G1a

Let’s start with the HP EliteBoard G1a. It’s the first full AI PC hidden right inside a keyboard. You just pick it up, drop it into any workspace, and you’ve got serious computing power in something that barely takes up space. The thing even snagged a CES 2026 Innovation Award.

2. HP EliteBook X G2 Series

These are high-end business laptops built for the age of AI. They’re made for folks who want performance, tight security, and smart features all in one slim package.

3. OmniBook Ultra 14 and OmniStudioX

On the consumer side, HP gave its OmniBook lineup a refresh. The new OmniBook Ultra 14 and OmniStudioX promise faster speeds, sharper video, and smarter AI tools—great for everyday users and creators who want something extra.

4. HP Printer with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Printing gets a big upgrade, too. HP became the first to bake Microsoft Copilot right into its office printers. With HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can summarise documents, translate, and organise files straight from the printer. That’s a real time-saver, especially for busy offices and small businesses in India.

5. Workforce Experience Platform (WXP)

For IT teams, HP improved its Workforce Experience Platform (WXP). Managing devices, keeping business running smoothly, and supporting remote work just got a lot simpler.

6. HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M

HP also introduced some new accessories, all designed with comfort and sustainability in mind. Think: the HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M (now in pink for a little flair), a compact 65W USB-C GaN charger, and protective laptop sleeves built to last.

7. OMEN and HyperX

Gamers, you’re not left out. OMEN and HyperX are now unified under the HyperX brand, and there’s the new HyperX OMEN MAX 16. HP calls it the world’s most powerful gaming laptop, complete with all-internal cooling.

8. HP Digital Passport

Another highlight is the HP Digital Passport. This platform, which also won a CES 2026 Innovation Award, gives you everything you need to know about your device—from features and sustainability details to support—all in one spot.

9. HP’s Future of Work Accelerator

And one thing to look ahead to is the HP Future of Work Accelerator, which is going to take place in 2026. It will offer funding, hardware and mentorship to organisations working in AI and workforce development.

Pour UBS, les ""étoiles s'alignent' pour L'Oréal, quand JPMorgan a intégré l'action dans sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"".

L'Oréal bondit à la Bourse de Paris vendredi, à la faveur d'un relèvement de recommandation par UBS, qui identifie une combinaison rare de facteurs bénéficiant au géant français des cosmétiques, tandis que JPMorgan l'a inscrit sur sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"" à l’approche des résultats de février.

Vers 12h, le titre gagne 4,4% à 380,30 euros tandis que son indice de référence, le CAC40 montant de 0,70% au même moment.

Dans une note publiée jeudi, UBS souligne que ""les étoiles s’alignent"" pour L’Oréal, le groupe étant porté par l’accélération du secteur et des gains de parts de marché, une valorisation jugée ""attrayante"" ainsi qu’un profil de risque amélioré.

Le courtier, qui relève sa recommandation à ""acheter"" contre ""neutre"", anticipe désormais une croissance organique de 6,4% au quatrième trimestre 2025, contre un consensus à 6,1%, et de 5,8% en 2026.

""Nous nous attendons à ce que L’Oréal indique une nouvelle année de surperformance par rapport à l’industrie de la beauté et de progrès supplémentaires en matière de rentabilité"", ajoute UBS.

""Positive Catalyst Watch""

En parallèle, JPMorgan a placé le groupe sur sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"".

Selon le courtier, les commentaires optimistes sur l’amélioration aux États-Unis et la reprise progressive en Chine donnés en décembre lors d'une journée des investisseurs, ainsi que les données récentes, devraient rassurer sur l’accélération de la ?croissance organique sous-jacente des ventes.

""La dynamique du chiffre d’affaires à court terme devrait être rassurante, avec un bon point de sortie vers 2025 et une poursuite probable de la dynamique au premier ?trimestre, ce qui pourrait renforcer la confiance pour 2026"", ajoute-t-il.

JPMorgan indique toutefois s’attendre à une croissance organique limitée à 4,4% en 2026, en dessous du consensus (+5%), en raison du ralentissement en Europe occidentale et d’une accélération séquentielle limitée en Chine.

Une ""surprise positive"" à court terme serait bien accueillie par le marché, souligne le courtier, mais une revalorisation durable du titre nécessiterait une surperformance plus marquée, ajoute-t-il cependant.

Zacks Investment Research does not engage in investment banking, market making or asset management activities of any securities.","Our estimates for Mounjaro and Zepbound suggest a CAGR of 44.6% and 73.7%, respectively, over the next three years. Meanwhile, in addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development with a range of oral and injectable medications with different mechanisms of action.

Lilly Inks Obesity Drug Deal with Trump Administration

LLY has inked a deal with the Trump Administration to provide wider access to obesity drugs through the ""TrumpRX"" platform. The new ""BALANCE"" program will allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity with lower co-pays ($50/month) starting in 2027. These incentives should help to drive hot obesity drug sales even further.

New Drugs, Future Pipeline will Continue to Drive Growth

In addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly has received approvals for other new drugs in the past couple of years. Omvoh/mirikizumab was approved for its first inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indication, ulcerative colitis, in the United States, Europe and Japan in 2023 and for its second IBD condition, Crohn's disease, in the United States, Europe, and Japan in 2025. Additionally, Lilly has been building its pipeline and has a wide range of compounds in various stages of development.

Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates expect robust EPS growth of 41.24% in 2026. LLY, which recently crossed the $1 trillion market cap landmark, will continue to attract institutional investors, as the company has the rare and coveted combination of rapid growth and underlying liquidity.

LLY Bounces off the Rising 10-Week MA

Beyond fundamentals, LLY's price action is also bullish. LLY shares are bouncing off the rising 10-week moving average for the first time since breaking out in late 2025, offering investors a high reward-to-risk entry point.

Bottom Line

Eli Lilly has solidified its position as a global pharma titan. With leading drugs and a massive obesity market, Lilly is poised to be a juggernaut for years to come.

Bear of the Day:

Based in Beijing, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock JD.com one of the largest Chinese e-commerce and technology companies. Also known as Jingdong, JD.com separates itself from the competition by being an essentially vertically integrated e-commerce retailer. JD holds its own inventory, is responsible for its own logistics and deliveries, and provides its own customer service.

JD is similar to Amazon in that it sells a wide variety of products on its e-commerce platform, including clothing, groceries, electronics, and more. Beyond e-commerce, JD also operates health, technology, real estate, and industrial segment businesses. Additionally, JD owns Ochama, a European-based retail brand with operations in the Netherlands France, and Poland.

JD Suffers from Relative Price Weakness Vs. Peers

Legendary growth investor William O'Neil once proclaimed that Wall Street's great paradox is, ""Stocks that seem too high in price and risky for most investors usually go higher and stocks that seem low and cheap often go lower."" I have largely discovered that more often than not, O'Neil's paradox comes to fruition. That's bad news for JD shares, which trade at $30 and are well off their all-time high of >$100.

Additionally, relative price action can provide investors with valuable clues. Currently, JD shares exhibit troubling relative weakness and are -15.02% over the past year, far underperforming top competitors like Pinduoduo and Alibabawhich are up 20.76% and 83.76% respectively.

JD: Slowing Sales Growth

JD sales growth is declining at an alarming rate. For the current quarter, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that earnings growth will be just 6.68%%. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest sluggish annual revenue growth of 5.22% in 2026.

JD Food Delivery Business is a Headwind

JD is making an aggressive play for the Chinese food delivery market. While the number of users for the company's Uber (UBER) Eats or DoorDash (DASH) like business has increased, the segment has produced significant losses thus far. Worse still, the company must invest significant capital to maintain its reputation for fast and reliable delivery in a highly competitive market.

Bottom Line

JD.com currently faces a difficult uphill battle. Between alarming slowdowns in growth and the financial strain of expansion into the competitive food delivery market, JD's ""cheap"" share price may be warranted.

Is BigBear.ai a NVIDIA-like AI Stock and Top 2026 Buy?

BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. has strengthened its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings and growth potential through a recent strategic acquisition and a robust cash position. However, a slowdown in revenue growth and rising losses raise questions about whether the stock is a buy now and whether it's too early to call it the next NVIDIA Corporation. Let's take a closer look.

Reasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai

BigBear.ai's recent $250 million acquisition of Ask Sage is expected to drive revenue growth by strengthening its footprint in national security, defense and intelligence markets. Ask Sage is a rapidly growing generative AI platform tailored for the defense industry and used by agencies, including Defense Health and the U.S. Space Force.

BigBear.ai's Ask Sage integration has added a secure generative AI workflow to its portfolio, enabling customers to deploy AI while preserving data sovereignty and security. Kevin McAleenan, CEO of BigBear.ai, added that ""Ask Sage is already operating at scale in mission-critical environments, and together we are bringing to market a secure, integrated AI platform that unifies data, software, and mission services in one place,"" as noted in the company's news release.

BigBear.ai's management is optimistic about future sales growth and has already raised full-year 2025 revenue guidance to between $125 million and $140 million, citing ir.bigbear.ai. Additionally, BigBear.ai's solid cash balance of $456.6 million as of Sept. 30, 2025, has provided the company with ample funds to support growth initiatives.

Is BBAI the Next NVIDIA-Like AI Stock & a Top Buy for 2026?

The Ask Sage acquisition, strong cash position and potential boost in government spending from President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" could accelerate BigBear.ai's revenue growth. The company is also moving closer to profitability. It reported third-quarter 2025 net income of $2.5 million, in contrast to the net loss of $15.1 million a year ago, which may encourage stakeholders to hold onto the stock.

However, even if it's anticipated that BigBear.ai will experience an acceleration in revenue growth, its results show a deceleration. BigBear.ai's third-quarter 2025 revenues of $33.1 million fell 20% year over year, following second-quarter 2025 revenues of $32.5 million, which declined 18% year over year. Moreover, the company posted a third-quarter operating loss of $21.9 million, more than double the previous year's figure.

All these factors suggest that it may not be the ideal time for new entrants to place bets on BigBear.ai. Declining sales growth and rising operating losses could hinder the company's growth momentum, making it premature to label BigBear.ai as the ""next NVIDIA"" in the field of AI.

The Jensen Huang-led company, on the other hand, has been reporting consistent increases in quarterly revenues and earnings, banking on the incessant demand for their next-generation Blackwell chips and CUDA software platform (read more: Top 3 AI Stocks, Including NVIDIA to Buy Now for 2026 Growth).

Currently, BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

The rollout of OpenAI for Healthcare makes it clear the company is betting that health is going to be a big vertical. OpenAI is looking to make ChatGPT a key tool on both sides of the healthcare equation. Anthropic has also launched Claude for Life Sciences and has embedded its models into healthcare workflows. Both model providers will compete and partner with healthcare efforts from multiple software and cloud vendors.

ChatGPT for Healthcare is rolling out with some major customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said AdventHealth, Baylor Scott & White Health, Boston Children’s Hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, HCA Healthcare, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford Medicine Children’s Health and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) will use ChatGPT for Healthcare.

OpenAI said healthcare providers have been tailoring OpenAI API to be HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT for Healthcare can help with serving up medical knowledge, admin work and personalize care. OpenAI provided sample prompts and use cases for ChatGPT for Healthcare.

ChatGPT for Healthcare includes:

GPT-5 models specifically built for healthcare and tested by physicians and benchmarked.

Citations for evidence retrieval to check sources.

Integrations with enterprise tools so healthcare providers align ChatGPT for Healthcare with policies, document repositories and best practices.

Templates for workflow automation for patient instructions, discharge summaries, clinical letters and authorizations.

Governance and access management based on roles.

HIPAA compliance. Content shared with ChatGPT for Healthcare isn't used to train models.

ChatGPT for Healthcare appears to have a better footing in the enterprise with big name customers already in the fold. It remains to be seen how ChatGPT Health fares with consumers.

Launched earlier this week to a small number of customers, ChatGPT Health is a dedicated experience where consumers can share medical records, data and wellness information. ChatGPT Health promises to keep conversations encrypted and isolated.

ChatGPT Health also integrates with Apple Health, Function and MyFitnessPal and will likely expand its roster of health apps in the future. OpenAI said that ChatGPT Health conversations won't flow over to regular chats. Ultimately, OpenAI sees ChatGPT Health as an advisor to prep consumers for doctor visits, improve nutrition and craft exercise programs. The service will even digest your lab results and point out what's important.

What could go wrong? Given that health is a primary use case for ChatGPT already, I didn't expect much wariness from health savvy consumers in my circle. Instead, the answers were unanimous with some form of ""hell no."" Biggest concern was sharing your data with OpenAI. Now this informal poll isn't scientific, but there will be some set of consumers that won't trust OpenAI's dedicated health service without some HIPAA-like promise.

Either way, ChatGPT for Healthcare may take care of patient usage. It'll just be a question of whether patients use OpenAI directly or indirectly.",https://www.constellationr.com/sites/default/files/styles/metatag/public/uploads/Screenshot%202026-01-09%20063242.png?itok=DLTJ05Da,N,,2026-01-09 08:01:56.950858

Significant Technical Reversal for L'Oréal

L'Oréal's stock marked an increase of 4.64% to 379.75 euros this Friday, January 9 at midday, up from a closing at 362.90 euros the previous day. This rise represents a significant technical reversal for the French cosmetics giant, as it now surpasses its key resistance level of 377.95 euros identified in previous days. The 50-day moving average, set at 365.21 euros, is also exceeded upwards, signaling a potential short-term trend change after several weeks of consolidation. This rebound occurs after Swiss bank UBS upgraded its recommendation from neutral to buy this morning, simultaneously raising its price target from 367 to 430 euros. UBS justifies this change by a significant improvement in the group's performance indicators, strengthened commercial dynamics in the United States and China, and reduced risks related to capital allocation. The bank anticipates a comparable sales growth of 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 5.8% in 2026, above the consensus established at 6.1% and 5.1% respectively. JPMorgan has also added the stock to its list of securities offering the best short-term yield-risk ratio.

Technical Indicators and Valuation

The RSI, standing at 39, confirms that the stock had been moving in a technically neutral zone without signs of overbuying, leaving room for progression. The MACD trend indicator, although slightly negative with a MACD line at minus 0.68 point below the signal line at 0.63 point, does not prevent this vigorous rebound supported by a major fundamental catalyst. The moderate monthly volatility of 5.22% and an almost zero beta at 0.10 demonstrate a relatively decoupled evolution from the movements of the CAC 40, which enhances the interest in this independent movement of the stock. UBS highlights that the stock's valuation has become attractive again, with a ratio of 26.5 times the estimated earnings for 2026, a level 20% below its five-year average. The brokerage also praises the strategic decision of the group to limit its stake in Galderma to 20%, ending uncertainties over future capital allocation. Bernstein has also slightly lowered its price target from 410 to 405 euros while maintaining its market performance recommendation. The group will publish its annual 2025 results on February 12, a date that will focus investor attention following this bond issue of 1.75 billion euros carried out on January 7 to partly finance the acquisition of an additional 10% stake in Galderma.

Best Buy Investment Narrative Recap

To own Best Buy, you need to believe the company can offset pressures in lower margin electronics with healthier earnings from services, memberships and vendor support. The recent news about disciplined holiday promotions and a tilt toward higher margin offerings supports that thesis and may help the key short term catalyst of margin stability, but it does not remove the core risk that mix shifts, promotions and competition could still pressure gross profit.

Among recent announcements, the continued commitment to a US$0.95 quarterly dividend stands out in this context, because it highlights management’s focus on returning cash to shareholders while working through softer earnings and margin compression. For investors, this sits alongside the push into higher margin services as a key part of how Best Buy is trying to balance current profitability with future reinvestment, even as online competition and direct to consumer brands test the resilience of its store centric model.

Yet behind this push into services, investors should still be aware of the risk that heavier exposure to lower margin categories and intense promotions could...

Best Buy's narrative projects $44.5 billion revenue and $1.5 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 2.3% yearly revenue growth and roughly a $700 million earnings increase from $778.0 million today.

Uncover how Best Buy's forecasts yield a $83.57 fair value, a 21% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$65 to US$147 per share, showing how far apart individual views can be. Against this spread, the focus on higher margin services as a potential earnings support invites you to weigh how such initiatives might influence Best Buy’s ability to handle pricing pressure and online competition over time.

The new 8m x 4.5m walls feature a 6.67mm pixel pitch and 10,000 nits of brightness – the company says this represents five times the resolution and double the brightness of the previous 16mm pixel pitch, 5,000-nit screens that had been in place for 12 years.

The Philips Urban LED 6000 Series walls carry an IP65 rating, designed to be resistant to water and airborne pollutants, with operational performance in temperatures ranging from -20°C to 50°C. Each wall operates with a power consumption of 18kW, compared to the original walls’ 23kW consumption.

Local AV specialist and PPDS partner Mansveld Techniek completed the installation in three weeks, ahead of the start of the 2025/26 Eredivisie season. The project requirements included high-quality performance, reliability, flexibility for various hosted events beyond football, and sustainability.

Sjors van den Boogaart, director of Philips Stadion, said: “After more than a decade of service, our displays have made way for the new LED walls in the Philips Stadion, delivering a huge leap in image quality and brightness, which perfectly aligns with our ambitions for innovation. Fans now experience sharper visuals, whilst installations continue to support dynamic and impactful content.”

Koen Vroomen, sales manager Benelux at PPDS, added: “Continuing PPDS’ enviable association and affiliation in designing and providing tailored dvLED solutions to some of the world’s leading professional teams – with FC Barcelona, Oracle Red Bull Racing and Harlequins RFC among those made public – we were delighted to be part of this exciting project.”

At Afresh, Litle will lead go-to-market strategy as the company expands how grocery teams use AI to plan, buy, and operate fresh food categories every day.
That same intelligence now supports a broader set of fresh food decisions, giving grocery teams a shared view of what is happening today and what needs to happen next.","Food technology executive joins Afresh, following record 70% growth, to expand its AI platform across merchandising, operations, and supply chain organizations.

SAN FRANCISCO — Afresh announced the appointment of Adam Litle as Chief Revenue Officer, following the company’s biggest year to date, with more than 70% year-over-year topline growth and usage across more than 12,000 grocery departments in North America. The hire reflects Afresh’s focus on accelerating adoption of its AI platform across the grocery industry. Litle joins a leadership team with deep experience operating enterprise software companies through periods of rapid growth.

Over the past year, Afresh has expanded its platform with several of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., including Albertsons, Wakefern, and Meijer. As adoption has grown, more merchandising, operations, and supply chain teams are relying on Afresh’s platform to run fresh food categories. With the launch of several new products in 2025—including Production Planning, Period Ending Inventory, Fresh Buying, and a major upgrade to its flagship Fresh Replenishment solution—the company is scaling to support continued growth across both U.S. and international markets.

Litle brings deep experience building and scaling technology companies in food, agriculture, and retail. He most recently served as CEO of Sound Agriculture and previously held the role of Chief Revenue Officer at Granular, where he helped grow the company from inception through its acquisition by Corteva—the second-largest agtech exit at the time. Earlier in his career, Litle led sales at Monetate, where he launched AI-driven personalization solutions for retail e-commerce, working closely with merchandising and digital teams. At Afresh, Litle will lead go-to-market strategy as the company expands how grocery teams use AI to plan, buy, and operate fresh food categories every day.

“What stood out to me about Afresh wasn’t just its leadership in fresh—it was the potential for it to expand its AI platform to all aspects of the food supply chain,” said Litle. “The company was built to tackle the staggering reality that 30-40% of global food production is wasted. Afresh applies cutting-edge AI to manage thousands of variables that impact buying, ordering, and inventory decisions for produce, meat, seafood, deli, and baked goods. The opportunity for Afresh’s technology to help optimize decisions across grocery and food distribution, all the way back to the farm, is massive.”

From the beginning, Afresh has focused on solving the operational complexity of fresh food at scale. The company first demonstrated this approach in fresh replenishment, where accurate ordering requires accounting for daily shifts in demand and supply. That same intelligence now supports a broader set of fresh food decisions, giving grocery teams a shared view of what is happening today and what needs to happen next.

“Afresh is at a pivotal moment as grocery teams face more volatility—and pressure to get decisions right—than ever before,” said Matt Schwartz, CEO and co-founder of Afresh. “Adam has spent his career helping food and agtech companies turn complex technology into real customer value. His experience scaling organizations in dynamic environments will be critical as we build on our momentum and expand Afresh’s impact across the industry.”",https://perishablenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B_Afresh.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:01:45.410939

Dior’s next retail opening in Asia centers on landscape as much as fashion. When the Dior Bamboo Pavilion opens on February 12 in Tokyo’s Daikanyama district, the House will introduce a temporary structure shaped by vegetation, architectural craft, and long-standing cultural ties between France and Japan. The Pavilion continues Dior’s recent series of experiential retail projects in cities including Bangkok and Seoul, while placing an unusually strong emphasis on gardens and plant life as organizing principles.

The exterior draws on Dior’s historic flagship at 30 Avenue Montaigne, incorporating recognizable house motifs such as the star Christian Dior regarded as his good luck charm. In Tokyo, those references take the form of a golden, bamboo-inspired facade, aligning the structure with the surrounding neighborhood. Daikanyama’s residential character, marked by small shops, cafes, and independent galleries, provides a subdued setting for the Pavilion’s architectural presence.

A garden as the pavilion’s core

Vegetation shapes the Pavilion from the inside out. The indoor green space conceived by floral artist Azuma Makoto forms the spatial center of the project, spanning more than 19,000 square feet. Makoto’s work for Dior has previously translated botanical forms into sculptural installations; in Tokyo, the scale expands to create an immersive environment that moves through layered plantings and architectural framing. The installation reflects Christian Dior’s documented fascination with gardens and their influence on his approach to color, silhouette, and composition.

Additional landscape elements extend throughout the Pavilion. A Zen garden designed by landscape designer Seijun Nishihata introduces a contemplative rhythm to the space, while a terrace and a pond populated with koi carp rendered in luminous glass introduce water and light as design elements.

The emphasis on gardens aligns the Pavilion with broader developments in luxury retail design, where biophilic environments have become increasingly common. Dior’s approach distinguishes itself through scale and integration, with vegetation shaping circulation, sightlines, and the pacing of the retail experience.

Fashion, craft, and cultural continuity

Within this landscaped setting, Dior will present women’s and men’s collections designed by creative director Jonathan Anderson, including ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories, and jewelry. A dedicated room for the customization of Lady Dior and Book Tote bags introduces a focused area for bespoke interaction, consistent with the Pavilion’s attention to craftsmanship.

Interior finishes combine established Dior codes with Japanese materials and techniques. Versailles parquet flooring appears alongside ceilings and walls finished in washi paper, while lanterns modeled after the Lady Dior bag punctuate the space. The Pavilion also includes works by contemporary designers and studios such as Takt Project, Sho Ota, Ayumi Shibata, We+, Hana Mitsui, and Chikaken, reinforcing connections to Tokyo’s design community.

The Pavilion will house Café Dior, featuring an exclusive menu developed by chef Anne-Sophie Pic, extending Dior’s ongoing collaboration with the Michelin-starred chef. The opening follows the launch of the Monsieur Dior restaurant in Beijing and reflects the House’s continued expansion into hospitality as part of its broader lifestyle strategy.",https://the-ethos.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dior-garden.webp,N,,2026-01-09 10:13:23.834740

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-09 08:05:51+00:00,EE Times,Nvidia Bets Big on China with H200 Push - EE Times,"Pablo Valerio, Sunny Bains",,,,,https://www.eetimes.com/nvidia-bets-big-on-china-with-h200-push/,"This would require Chinese companies to buy a certain number of domestic chips, like Huawei’s Ascend series, with every Nvidia H200 order.
To make this work, Beijing has reportedly told tech companies to temporarily stop buying H200 chips.
Now, buyers must pay the full amount upfront for H200 orders, with no option to cancel or get a refund.
Even with these tough terms, Chinese companies are still eager to buy, underscoring their need for computing power to train large language models.
As TSMC increases production and the U.S. collects its fees, the movement of H200 chips will show where global tech separation is heading.","This week, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared confident despite the complex geopolitical challenges facing the company.

Standing before a packed crowd, Huang confirmed the substantial Chinese demand for Nvidia’s advanced H200 artificial-intelligence processors. “We’ve fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,” he said Tuesday during a Q&A session. “We’re getting the last details of the licensing finished with the U.S. government.”

Despite Huang’s confident statements, Nvidia faces a complicated set of regulations that make selling these chips unusually difficult. The company has asked TSMC to increase production, but it must deal with two major challenges: a 25% tax from the U.S. government and a policy from Beijing that pushes customers to buy from local competitors.

Frenzy in the supply chain

Nvidia is acting quickly to capitalize on what it sees as a new opportunity. People familiar with the situation say the company has officially asked TSMC to make more H200 chips to meet rising demand from Chinese tech companies.

The data shows a significant demand for computing power. Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba have reportedly placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, with deliveries scheduled for this year. This demand is well above Nvidia’s current stock of about 700,000 units, so the company plans to start additional manufacturing runs in the second quarter of 2026.

Each chip costs about $27,000 and represents a significant improvement over earlier H20 processors sold in China. But delivering these orders is not just a matter of logistics—it also depends on political stability. As Huang said on Tuesday, “The future ships on schedule; the present ships when it’s allowed to.”

Washington’s price of admission

The resumption of high-end chip sales to China follows a chaotic period of policy shifts in Washington. The Biden administration had previously instituted a broad ban on advanced AI semiconductors to thwart China’s military modernization.

In a major change, President Donald Trump recently allowed the export of the H200 to “approved customers,” but added a new rule: 25% fee on sales revenue must go to the U.S. Treasury. To sell to China, Nvidia must first ship the chips to the U.S., pay the 25% as an import tax, undergo a “security inspection,” and then send the chips to Chinese customers.

Experts say this policy marks a shift from trying to contain China to making money from sales. It has sparked heated debate within the U.S. government. Senate Democrats and some national security advocates have called the decision “dangerous,” saying the H200—about six times more powerful than the previous model—will “turbocharge” China’s military capabilities. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, seven senators warned that the administration was sacrificing national security at risk for corporate profits.

“The President’s dangerous decision to give away critical national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities,” the senators wrote.

Even with presidential approval, shipments are still slowed by bureaucracy. Each export needs its own license, which can delay or stop shipments. Nvidia executives say the final details of the licensing process are still being worked out, so shipping dates remain uncertain.

Beijing’s “matchmaking” mandate

While Washington seeks to tax Nvidia’s entry, Beijing is maneuvering to limit it. The Chinese government is treating the H200 not just as a product but as a strategic lever to force domestic self-sufficiency.

According to Reuters, regulators at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) are creating a “matchmaking” policy. This would require Chinese companies to buy a certain number of domestic chips, like Huawei’s Ascend series, with every Nvidia H200 order.

To make this work, Beijing has reportedly told tech companies to temporarily stop buying H200 chips. This pause prevents a rush to buy U.S. chips and to protect local companies’ market share. Soon, commercial buyers may also have to explain why domestic chips are not enough before they can import Nvidia products.

For the public sector, access is not allowed. Beijing plans to stop the military, state-owned companies, and key infrastructure operators from buying the H200, citing security risks and the chance that the U.S. could disable the hardware remotely.

Nvidia’s strict payment conditions

Stuck between two unpredictable governments, Nvidia has protected itself by setting strict payment rules for Chinese customers. Now, buyers must pay the full amount upfront for H200 orders, with no option to cancel or get a refund.

This cash-before-delivery approach puts all the financial risk on Chinese buyers if regulations change. Nvidia is being careful because, in 2025, it had to write off $5.5 billion in inventory after new U.S. export rules made its China-only H20 chip unsellable overnight.

“Nvidia has been burned in the past,” said a source familiar with the company. The payment structure ensures that if the political winds shift again, Nvidia isn’t left holding the bag. Even with these tough terms, Chinese companies are still eager to buy, underscoring their need for computing power to train large language models.

Geopolitical tug-of-war

The struggle over the H200 highlights a fundamental bifurcation in the global technology stack. While the U.S. attempts to maintain leverage through export controls and tariffs, China is accelerating its “Silicon Sovereignty” campaign.

U.S. bans have actually helped drive Chinese innovation. Local chipmakers like Huawei and Baidu are moving from backup roles to becoming “core pillars” of China’s AI industry, now controlling over 70% of the local cloud-computing chip market. While the H200 is still better for large-scale training, analysts note that the performance gap is narrowing.

For now, Nvidia is still in control. At CES, Huang avoided talking about politics and focused on supply and demand. “We learn about everything through purchase orders,” Huang said. “If the purchase orders come, it’s because they’re able to place purchase orders.”

Right now, the situation looks like a tug-of-war over regulations. The U.S. sometimes loosens rules to collect revenue but also tries to block sales to military sectors. China, seeing that it can’t rely on the U.S., is working hard to build its own technology so it won’t have to depend on American chips in the future.

Conclusion: Value Justifies the Premium Agilent’s valuation premium is best understood through an owner’s lens, not through short-term earnings beats.","is a broad-based life science and analytical instrument company with a product portfolio spanning chromatography (GC/LC), mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, lab automation, vacuum technology, and related software/consumables. This workflow breadth and integrated approach differentiate it from peers. Agilent often wins large multi-instrument lab contracts and then captures high-margin follow-on revenue (service and supplies) through its Agilent CrossLab business.

Its pricing power is evidenced by industry-leading gross margins (~54% in FY2024) lifted by targeted price increases. The company also boasts a rapid innovation cycle for example, in 202223 Agilent introduced first?of?its?kind products like the HydroInert hydrogen-carrier gas source for GC-MS and new automation systems (AssayMAP and Seahorse), reinforcing technological leadership.

In contrast to (focused primarily on chromatography) or (smaller, Asia-centric), Agilent’s scope and recurring revenue streams (services + consumables) give it stronger customer lock-in. Compared to giants like or , Agilent’s pure-play instrument/service model allows leaner operations and faster share gains in niche markets.

Workflow breadth

Agilent uniquely offers end-to-end lab solutions (sample preparation automation, various analytical platforms, instrument-agnostic consumables, and software). It is a major vendor not only of GC/LC but also of mass spec, spectroscopy, and even cell analysis equipment. This contrasts with Waters (mostly HPLC/LCMS) or Shimadzu (strong in GC-MS in Asia but narrower). Agilent’s wide offering lets it bundle products and services across workflows, making customer switching harder.

Pricing power

High recurring volume and product differentiation allow Agilent to maintain healthy pricing. In FY2024, Agilent implemented targeted price increases that expanded overall gross margin by ~4 points to 54.3%stocklight.com, even with mixed sales.

In late 2023, Waters similarly noted gross-margin expansion of 170 bp (to ~59.6%) despite softer orders, but Agilent’s overall margin is buoyed by its service/consumable mix (CrossLab operating margin ~31.9% in FY2024). In practical terms, Agilent can raise prices on instruments and especially on recurring kits/columns year-over-year without losing all volume, a sign of pricing power above commoditized peers.

Innovation cycle

Agilent invests ~78% of sales in R&D, generating a steady stream of new products. Recent innovations (HydroInert, advanced LC columns, automated sample prep) have won awards and share gains. Management notes an innovation engine fueled by AI and technology partnerships.

Such rapid product refresh keeps Agilent’s lineup competitive. By contrast, some peers move more slowly or rely on acquisitions; Agilent’s focused R&D spending and leaner structure mean it can roll out new platforms (and the higher margin they command) faster.

Analyzing the Q4 Financial Beat: Margin and Growth Dynamics

Agilent concluded its fiscal year 2025 with strong operational results, showcasing accelerating momentum. For the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2025, the company reported revenue of $1.86 billion. This figure successfully surpassed the company’s own guidance range (which was $1.822 billion to $1.842 billion) and exceeded consensus expectations. The revenue represented a 9.4% reported increase and a 7.2% core growth rate compared to Q4 2024.

The strong top-line performance translated effectively into the bottom line. Non-GAAP net income reached $452 million, resulting in Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.59. This Non-GAAP EPS grew 9% from the prior year’s quarter and narrowly surpassed analyst forecasts.

GAAP net income was $434 million, or $1.53 per share, representing an even stronger YoY growth of 25%. For the full fiscal year 2025, Agilent generated total revenue of $6.95 billion, a 4.9% core growth increase, with Non-GAAP EPS of $5.59. The modest operating leverage demonstrated, where 9% EPS growth outpaced 7.2% core revenue growth, suggests effective cost management and pricing power were utilized throughout the period.

A critical element of the Q4 performance was the quality of execution demonstrated by management. The 7.2% core growth rate achieved marked the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential core growth acceleration. Management commentary emphasized that these top-line results ""compare very favorably with our peers,"" indicating market share capture and operational strength in a market environment still defined by signs of normalization.

The robust execution performance substantially reduces the intrinsic execution risk modeled into future projections, particularly the outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. Strong current execution means a lower probability of a major shortfall in the subsequent period. The fact that the company is delivering strong financial results while simultaneously planning for ""incremental investments in growth and innovation"" indicates management’s confidence in its operational efficiencies. This level of confidence allows investors and analysts to model future cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, which, in a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation framework, warrants a lower required discount rate, thereby bolstering the calculated intrinsic value.

Execution Excellence Is Structural, Not Cyclical

Agilent’s recent outperformance should not be viewed as a short-term execution win tied to a single quarter. Instead, it reflects a deliberate business architecture designed to perform best during industry downturns, precisely when relative execution differences become visible.

Agilent has intentionally built a large, services- and consumables-heavy revenue stream that is economically tied to its installed base rather than new instrument placements. During tool-sector slowdowns, when customers defer capital equipment purchases, demand for services, compliance support, replacement parts, and consumables does not disappear in many cases; it increases. Labs sweat existing assets harder, raising utilization and service intensity. This makes CrossLab counter-cyclical in practice, not just defensive in theory.

Second, installed-base monetization rises when instrument spending pauses

Unlike peers that rely more heavily on upfront instrument sales, Agilent monetizes customers across the full instrument lifecycle. Once a system is placed, it generates years of high-margin follow-on revenue through qualification, maintenance, software, and consumables. This means that when new system demand normalizes, Agilent continues to compound value from past placements, a dynamic that only becomes visible during downturns.

Third, balance-sheet conservatism enables reinvestment when peers retrench

Agilent’s low leverage and operating discipline inherited from its HP lineage allow it to maintain R&D intensity and make incremental growth investments even during cyclical slowdowns. While more leveraged peers are forced to protect margins or reduce spending, Agilent can play offense: funding innovation, strengthening customer relationships, and selectively investing in capacity or tuck-in acquisitions.

All major life-science tools companies possess elements of these traits, but Agilent’s model combines them more evenly and consistently. This structural resilience is why Agilent’s execution advantage becomes most visible during industry stress and not at cycle peaks.

Navigating Cyclical Normalization

The analytical tools sector is cyclical, tied to lab capex budgets and macro swings. Agilent’s recent earnings illustrate how it handled a downcycle better than most peers. In FY2023 (ended Oct ’23), many labs delayed equipment spend; Agilent’s Life Sciences segment (instruments) fell ~4% on the year (core), but CrossLab grew ~10% core.

Overall revenue was essentially flat (+1.5% core) with GAAP EPS steady at $4.19. Management noted that despite a challenging year for the industry, Agilent delivered leveraged earnings and expects a slow but steady recovery.

By contrast, peers saw sharper declines. For example, Danaher’s Life Sciences business saw a base-business core revenue drop of ~3% (11.5% including acquisitions/spins) in Q3 2023. Waters’ Q4 2023 sales fell ~8% organically, with instrument sales off ~14% even as recurring revenue grew.

Agilent’s more diversified end markets (pharma, biotech, academia, environment, materials) and its heavy tilt toward consumables/services meant it was less exposed to any single slump. Structurally, Agilent benefited from:

Lean cost structure: Even as top-line softened, Agilent held the line on R&D and cut some SG&A, which expanded margins. (FY2024 non-GAAP OPEX shrank ~4% YoYs)

Segment reorganization: In late 2023, Agilent regrouped its units (forming a Life Sciences & Diagnostics Markets Group, etc.), aiming for tighter market focus. This build/buy strategy (including the 2024 BioVectra CDMO acquisition) positioned Agilent to capture growth as markets recover.

Operational discipline: Through the cycle, Agilent generated roughly stable operating cash (~$1.75 B in FY24, similar to $1.77 B in FY23), showing it can sustain cash flow even with uneven revenues.

Capital Efficiency & Value Creation

Agilent’s business model converts sales into cash very efficiently, fueling high ROIC and shareholder returns. In FY2024, it generated ~$1.75 B of operating cash. After capital expenditures ($378 M) and acquisitions, free cash flow ran about $1.4 B (consistent with reporting and analytics). In other words, ~90% of net income flows out as cash.

This is aided by moderate reinvestment: FY2024 capex was only ~6% of (mostly to expand manufacturing, e.g., in diagnostics and CDMO), and R&D spends around 78% of revenue. The result is a high return on invested capital. Agilent’s ROIC has been ~1314% in recent years, meaning each dollar reinvested yields strong profit.

With this cash, Agilent aggressively rewards investors. In FY2024, the company repurchased 8.4 million shares at ~$1.15 Bn and paid $274 M in dividends. That $1.15 Bn buyback alone was ~10% of market cap, cutting share count significantly and boosting EPS. The board has authorized up to $2.0 B more in buybacks. Meanwhile, leverage remains low modest net debt after the BioVectra acquisition. In summary, Agilent turns profit into cash, then redeploys it into growth (BioVectra, R&D) and buybacks, compounding intrinsic value.

Growth Drivers & GLP1 Tailwind

Agilent’s future growth rests on secular trends across life sciences and applied markets. Major end markets include pharma/biotech R&D, diagnostics (e.g., cancer screening), food/environment testing, and advanced materials (semiconductors, EV batteries). In each, demand for precision analysis is rising. For example, as biologic drug R&D grows, so does the need for Agilent’s chromatography and mass spec systems.

The recent cell therapy boom and genomics also help Agilent’s diagnostics tools. In industrial markets, trends like semiconductor reshoring and PFAS water testing require analytical instruments.

GLP-1 peptide drugs (e.g. weight-loss diabetes treatments) have drawn investor hype as a demand driver. Agilent notes that its GLP-1-related sales were about $130 million in FY2025 (split roughly evenly between its new BioVectra manufacturing subsidiary and lab instruments/consumables), which was up ~20% from the prior year. In Q4 alone, GLP-1 work drove ~$40M of revenue.

However, GLP-1s are just one end-market. They accounted for only a few percent of Agilent’s ~$6.8B sales, and growth there partly reflects Air chromatography columns and Oligo synthesis tools that also serve other peptide/oligo markets. We view GLP-1 as a proportional tailwind, not a core moat.

The company itself treats GLP-1 as a subset of its Pharma & Biotech market growth. Over the long run, fundamental drivers remain broader: multi-year CAGR in global lab equipment (?57%), genomics, biologics R&D, and lab automation adoption.

Other growth levers include Agilent’s expanding footprint in high-value fields: its recent BioVectra acquisition (~$145M revenues, specializing in custom synthesis/CDMO for mRNA and oligos) promises to tap booming biologics manufacturing demand. Its Diagnostics & Genomics Group (cancer diagnostics, next-gen sequencing) is small today but growing. Meanwhile, capitalizing on software and AI (integrated lab informatics) could unlock more value per customer (Agilent is asymmetrically investing in software in CrossLab).

Valuation Landscape: Price vs. Intrinsic Value

A deep dive into Agilent’s valuation multiples, comparing the stock against its historical averages and its high-quality peer group, helps determine if the current market price reflects the company’s strong operational execution and robust intrinsic value drivers. As of November 26, 2025, Agilent’s stock trades at a premium when viewed against its recent historical valuation averages.

Agilent Valuation Multiples (Absolute and Historical)

The current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.07x represents an approximate 8.16% premium over the stock’s 5-year average P/E of 33.35x. This premium suggests that the market is already pricing in the expected acceleration in core growth, the achievement of the projected 75 basis points in operating margin expansion, and the de-risking of the business model through the strong Q4 FY2025 execution. The market is effectively assigning a higher growth rate and/or lower risk to Agilent’s future earnings profile relative to its own recent history.

Peer Group Comparison: Benchmarking Execution Quality

Comparing Agilent using the Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiple offers a clearer view of its relative operational valuation, independent of capital structure differences. Agilent trades at 23.7x EV/EBITDA on a trailing twelve months (LTM) basis.

Comparative Valuation Metrics: Life Science & Applied Markets Peers

Agilent’s valuation multiple is slightly higher than or equivalent to its key large peers, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (23.0x EV/EBITDA) and Waters Corporation (22.0x EV/EBITDA). This marginal premium assigned to Agilent validates management’s assertion of superior execution. Despite being smaller than global giants like Thermo Fisher, Agilent is valued equivalently or slightly higher on a per-unit operating profit basis. This market assessment implies that investors are willing to pay a premium for Agilent’s high-quality revenue base (ACG), its demonstrated ability to capture market share, and its focused exposure to powerful secular trends like GLP-1, positioning it as a ""premium-priced growth stabilizer"" within the life science tools sector.

Following the Financial Titans: Recent Guru Activity

Agilent’s valuation premium is further supported by the presence of patient, long-term institutional owners that have historically favored resilient, cash-rich compounders over cyclical earnings stories. Firms such as Durable Capital (Henry Ellenbogen), Capital Group, and Wellington Management all rank among Agilent’s meaningful shareholders, collectively representing a substantial portion of the company’s long-term institutional ownership base.

These firms are known for building concentrated positions in businesses that demonstrate high free-cash-flow conversion, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to reinvest consistently through economic cycles. Durable Capital, in particular, has a track record of backing companies with structurally recurring revenues and strong balance sheets, while Capital Group and Wellington have long emphasized downside resilience and capital preservation alongside growth.

Conclusion: Value Justifies the Premium

Agilent’s valuation premium is best understood through an owner’s lens, not through short-term earnings beats. The company consistently converts a high proportion of operating income into free cash flow, supported by a recurring revenue base that stabilizes cash generation precisely when industry conditions weaken.

The CrossLab business is central to this dynamic. Its recurring, contract-driven revenue stream lowers cash-flow volatility and reduces the risk of capital impairment across cycles. This predictability allows Agilent to self-fund reinvestment through downturns, sustaining R&D, supporting innovation, and strengthening competitive positioning, while peers with higher leverage or more cyclical revenue profiles are forced to pull back.

This combination of high cash conversion, structural recurrence, and balance-sheet strength underpins Agilent’s ability to compound intrinsic value over time. Investors are not paying a premium for growth alone but for a business model that preserves and reinvests capital efficiently across cycles.

Long-term patient capital has historically recognized these traits. Institutions such as Durable Capital, Capital Group, and Wellington have demonstrated sustained interest in companies with resilient cash-flow profiles, disciplined reinvestment, and durable competitive advantages, characteristics that align closely with Agilent’s operating model. Viewed through this lens, Agilent’s modest valuation premium reflects lower business risk and higher long-term capital efficiency, rather than optimism embedded in near-term earnings expectations.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 08:01:29.681434

SPX Technologies Investment Narrative Recap

To own SPX Technologies, I think you need to believe that its HVAC and Detection & Measurement platforms can convert project backlogs and data center demand into durable earnings, despite cyclical and competitive pressures. Whitman’s appointment and the warm-water cooling debate do not appear to change the core near term catalyst, which still centers on executing against data center cooling demand, or the key risk around potential growth lumpiness in the D&M project pipeline.

The most relevant recent development here is Nvidia’s warm-water data center cooling commentary, which briefly pressured SPX’s share price but, according to TD Cowen analysis, still leaves cooling towers as a required part of liquid-cooled designs. For investors focused on SPX’s data center catalyst, this reinforces that the OlympusV Max launch and ongoing capacity expansions matter most, while also highlighting how quickly sentiment can swing on perceived technology shifts.

Yet investors should be aware that if large Detection & Measurement projects pulled into 2025 do not repeat in later years, SPX’s earnings could...

Successor liability arises from the concept of undertaking which defines the infringer in EU antitrust law.
In reality, the apparent inconsistency of the CJEU’s case law on successor liability conceals a clear underlying objective that shapes the EU approach.
Instead, the Commission’s principal aim with successor liability is to secure payment of the fine.
As a first step, antitrust liability should be reframed as a form of substitute liability in the context of M&A successor liability.","Mergers & acquisitions (M&A) practices are often known for their frantic pace, a rhythm that can conflict with the careful consideration required for antitrust issues. Yet, while frequently underestimated in M&A deals, antitrust risks can become quite costly under the EU’s doctrine of successor liability.

Successor liability arises from the concept of undertaking which defines the infringer in EU antitrust law. On this basis, the Commission may attribute liability for antitrust infringements to a legal entity that was not operating the business at the time of the misconduct, including a buyer in an M&A transaction. While this approach broadens the scope of antitrust liability, it stands in tension with fundamental principles of corporate law, which generally preserve the legal separateness of entities and protect shareholders from company debts.

Traditionally, the doctrine of successor liability was applied in three situations: when the original infringer no longer existed, when companies were linked through structural ties, and when the transfer occurred under abusive, non-market conditions. Yet, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) gradually expanded the scope of successor liability through its case law, making its application increasingly unpredictable and creating significant legal uncertainty for M&A transactions.

This uncertainty is illustrated by four factually very similar cases in which the CJEU nevertheless reached four different outcomes. In each case, a company involved in a cartel sold its infringing assets, raising the same legal question: after the transfer, which entity should bear the fine for breaches of EU antitrust law? In Hoechst [2009], liability remained with the original infringer despite the transfer of cartelised assets (para 16), while in Moreda liability was shifted to the newly merged successor notwithstanding a similar transfer of infringing assets (para 318). By contrast, in Parker Hannifin [2014], the Court held the acquirer of the cartel-related assets responsible, allowing liability to follow the transferred assets rather than the original infringer (para 41). Finally, in Prysmian [2020], liability was extended simultaneously to both the former and new parent companies (para 19).

In reality, the apparent inconsistency of the CJEU’s case law on successor liability conceals a clear underlying objective that shapes the EU approach. Contrary to what some scholars suggest, the Commission’s concern here is not primarily deterrence, as it is in the doctrines of parental and subsidiary liability. Parental liability rests on the parent company’s control over the infringing entity at some point in time. By contrast, in cases of successor liability, assuming the infringing activity was discontinued, successors had no such control and thus could not have prevented the infringement. For this reason, deterrence offers little justification for extending liability to successors. Instead, the Commission’s principal aim with successor liability is to secure payment of the fine.

EU legislators should acknowledge this enforcement goal openly and shift the burden away from buyers in M&A transactions, placing it instead on sellers, who are considerably more likely to have exercised control over the infringement at some point in time. This could be achieved through a two-step approach: (1) introducing substitute liability and (2) establishing mandatory escrow accounts.

As a first step, antitrust liability should be reframed as a form of substitute liability in the context of M&A successor liability. The law ought to recognize that buyers had no control over antitrust infringements committed prior to an acquisition, and acquirers should therefore be seen as paying on behalf of the perpetrator rather than being the perpetrator themselves. In practice, this would mean that the successor could be required to satisfy the fine not because it engaged in the infringement, but to ensure that it is collected when no other alternative is available. Borrowing from the 2017 amendments to the German Competition Act, specifically section 81 a, such an obligation would function as a financial guarantee rather than a sanction, placing the acquirer in the role of guarantor rather than culprit.

This approach carries several advantages. It avoids stigmatizing successor companies as cartelists and shields them from reputational harm. It also protects acquirers from regulatory consequences such as repeat-offender status, license revocations, or blacklisting. Codifying this substitute liability would further enhance legal certainty, since buyers would know in advance that they may be pursued as substitute payers. For enforcers, the model is equally attractive: because it does not involve any allegation of wrongdoing, the procedural safeguards attached to fines need not apply. At the same time, it ensures more reliable collection, makes evasion more difficult, and simplifies enforcement by avoiding complex continuity tests and reducing litigation, as the substitute debtor cannot dispute intent or fault.

This brings us to the financial risks faced by acquirers in M&A transactions. Protection from reputational and regulatory consequences, as well as greater legal certainty, offers limited comfort when buyers may still be required to shoulder substantial antitrust fines. To address this concern, the second part of the solution is the introduction of mandatory antitrust escrow accounts to M&A deals.

Escrow accounts were originally a common law mechanism which serve as a financial safeguard and thus complement the benefits of substitute liability. Their trigger event should be the payment of antitrust indemnification claims brought by the buyer or third parties against the target. Crucially, though, to ensure that fines are paid following an M&A deal, such accounts must be subject to both a minimum amount and a minimum term. The reasoning is straightforward: if the funds are insufficient, antitrust fines cannot be paid, and the burden once again shifts from the seller to the buyer.

The escrow amount should cover a substantial portion, though not the entirety, of any potential antitrust fine. The key is to strike a balance: easing the buyer’s financial burden, while addressing moral hazard and avoiding excessive immobilization of the seller’s proceeds. As for the minimum escrow term, the most appropriate benchmark from a buyer’s perspective is the prescriptive period of antitrust fines, excluding disputed sums.

Overall, substitute liability in combination with mandatory escrow accounts could substantially reduce the antitrust related risks faced by acquirers in M&A transactions in Europe. By combining elements from both common law and civil law traditions, this approach would increase legal certainty for buyers, shield them from reputational and regulatory harm, and ensure that a significant share of fines is born by sellers. At the same time, it would facilitate enforcement by guaranteeing payment, even if this means temporarily restricting access to part of seller’s proceeds.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/fileTPSASt,N,,2026-01-09 02:00:11.663884

In personal finance, it is already complicated to rank choices based solely on the risk/return pair.
It is easy to understand that few investments perfectly meet these four criteria, making it complex to rank the options considered.","What a journey from the blackboard to dark chocolate!

From a young age, we learn on the blackboard in math class that if A is greater than B and B is greater than C, then A is greater than C. But very early on, sometimes as soon as the next recess, the game rock-paper-scissors casts doubt on these obvious truths: indeed, the player who shows a hand symbolizing rock beats the one representing scissors, scissors beat paper, but paper beats rock by covering it! Thus, the hierarchy of choices is not so obvious and is so complex that this basic game has given rise to abundant literature on how to win.

The problem of transitivity of preferences becomes more complex when the choice is no longer based on one criterion (in our example, rock wins or loses) but on three criteria to rank options. Imagine Céline hesitating between three boxes of dark chocolates to offer her guests at the New Year's Eve party:

- the ""artisan box"" costs €15 for 12 chocolates with 3 fillings,

- the ""gourmet box"" costs €20 for 20 chocolates with 2 fillings,

- the ""luxury box"" costs €25 for 24 chocolates but with only one filling.

Obviously, on the price criterion, the artisan box is preferred over the gourmet box, which in turn is preferred over the luxury box. For the number of fillings, the gourmet box is preferred over the luxury box; but the luxury box, overlooked in the previous criteria, is preferred over the artisan box for the number of chocolates it contains!

The landmark study2 on intransitivity of preferences in multicriteria choices dates back to 1969. Amos Tversky asked participants to rank 45 candidate profiles by successive pairs according to three criteria (intelligence, emotion and sociability), the first indicated as essential and each quantified by scores. The author highlights the use of the semi-lexicographic order3, which is a decision rule where options are compared according to a hierarchy of criteria, taking into account thresholds to judge whether a difference is relevant. The existence of a sensitivity threshold below which small differences are ignored leads to intransitive preferences and ultimately to contradictions between choices that participants do not perceive at all.

One can easily imagine the complexity of choosing the box of dark chocolates to offer when, moreover, one must choose not according to one’s own (incoherent) preferences but on behalf of someone else!

Not everything is so black!

Thus, even in the presence of clear criteria, choice can be complex. Enough to discourage any desire to make relevant financial decisions. In personal finance, it is already complicated to rank choices based solely on the risk/return pair. Indeed, to be meaningful, one must properly understand the desired level of return and the acceptance of risk (which vary between individuals) but also correctly assess the probabilities of realizing that return and that risk.

The question of transitivity of preferences arises as soon as different criteria are mixed. Yet, the risk/return pair constitutes a criterion to be evaluated just like liquidity (the ability to sell a financial asset without time constraints), volatility (a linear increase in the value of an asset or erratic evolution that can cause the discomfort of a latent loss), or the time dimension (short, medium, or long term). It is easy to understand that few investments perfectly meet these four criteria, making it complex to rank the options considered.

Returning to the reference study on the subject, Tversky compares the results proposed by participants with those given by the Weighted Scoring Technique method, which precisely respects transitivity and coherence. This method ranks options by adding the scores obtained for each of the different criteria, previously weighted.

In this methodology, we find the principle known to students: that of the weighted average of different scores… including that of the math class at the beginning of the article! Like rock-paper-scissors… the circle is closed once again.

Aktis priced 17.65 million shares at $18 each, more than what it planned to sell, according to an updated securities filing earlier this week.
AKY-1189, its most advanced prospect, is a “miniprotein radioconjugate” targeting Nectin-4, the same protein that Pfizer’s bladder cancer drug Padcev binds to.
Prior to its IPO, Aktis banked $346 million in private funding to advance its pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals, including investments from MPM BioImpact, Vida Ventures and RA Capital.
Only one, Ascentage Pharma, was a cancer drug developer.","Radiopharmaceutical drug developer Aktis Oncology on Thursday said it raised $318 million from an initial public offering, the first for a biotechnology company in 2026.

Aktis priced 17.65 million shares at $18 each, more than what it planned to sell, according to an updated securities filing earlier this week. It upsized the round after Eli Lilly, which previously partnered with the cancer drugmaker, stepped in to purchase $100 million, or a third of the shares. Aktis will begin trading Friday on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “AKTS.”

The company, which is based in Boston, is developing a twist on specialized cancer drugs that it says can hit tumor targets “outside the scope” of other radiopharmaceuticals.

AKY-1189, its most advanced prospect, is a “miniprotein radioconjugate” targeting Nectin-4, the same protein that Pfizer’s bladder cancer drug Padcev binds to. Aktis is studying what other cancers it could be used in, with Phase 1 study results expected in the first quarter of 2027.

A second experimental drug, dubbed AKY-2519, goes after solid tumors that express a protein called B7-H3. Tumors with high levels of B7-H3 have been hard to treat, responding poorly to other cancer therapies such as anti-PD1 drugs, according to Aktis. The collaboration with Lilly could yield additional radiopharmaceutical targets.

Prior to its IPO, Aktis banked $346 million in private funding to advance its pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals, including investments from MPM BioImpact, Vida Ventures and RA Capital.

Last year was a slow one for biotech companies looking to raise money on the public markets, with less than a dozen firms pricing IPOs, according to BioPharma Dive data. Only one, Ascentage Pharma, was a cancer drug developer.

But radiopharma companies overall have lured major pharmaceutical firms like Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb. and Novartis. The latter, in particular, saw major success with its radiopharmaceuticals Pluvicto and Lutathera, setting off a chain of acquisitions by other pharmas looking for more precise medicines to attack tumors.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/L9tt3ZM2R1rkC2354eym0s0GuZCz6WlhY_DhaghP5hI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDUxMTE2NzE0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-09 01:00:44.968933

Canada-U.S. flight volumes fell more than 14 per cent year-over-year in the fourth quarter among Canada’s five largest carriers — Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and Flair Airlines — according to figures from aviation data firm Cirium.

Canadian flight volumes to Cancun, Mexico, jumped by 35 per cent, and to Central America by nearly a third last quarter.","MONTREAL — Canadian airlines pulled back in a big way from the United States over the past year and boosted flight volumes elsewhere — especially the Caribbean — with no sign of a cross-border rebound on the horizon.

Canada-U.S. flight volumes fell more than 14 per cent year-over-year in the fourth quarter among Canada’s five largest carriers — Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and Flair Airlines — according to figures from aviation data firm Cirium.

Florida, California and Nevada saw some of the biggest drops in capacity from Canadian carriers, with volumes to Las Vegas down by a third from a year earlier.

Meanwhile, as passengers looked farther afield, airlines ramped up flight volumes in the Caribbean and South America — by 36 per cent last quarter and 45 per cent in the current one.

The number of domestic flights and trips to Europe and Asia also rose from 2024 as airlines scrambled to rejig their networks.

Former transport professor Jacques Roy says Canadians’ distaste for U.S. visits triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff war and social policies nonetheless marks a problem for airlines north of the border, which will have to compete in more crowded fields overseas and domestically.

“There is a natural reaction from Canadian travellers, who try to get their suntan from other destinations,"" he said.

Nor are there signs of a return to business as usual. Canadian airline schedules show a 15 per cent drop in U.S. flight volumes during the first three months of this year compared to 2025 — when passengers had already started to shy away from travel to a country whose leader spouted 51st-state rhetoric in reference to its northern neighbour.

First-quarter volumes for Arizona-bound flights are scheduled to fall by more than 20 per cent year-over-year. For Florida, the figure is nearly 19 per cent.

""The airlines were hoping that this was just going to be a flash in the pan ... that it would eventually settle back into a return to sun destinations by the time the fourth quarter rolled along,"" said John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University.

That didn't happen. ""And the first quarter doesn’t look much brighter.”

The first-quarter decrease amounts to nearly 850,000 seats, according to Cirium.

""We see no indication that this trend will change in the foreseeable future, so we are anticipating further reductions to our transborder network in 2026,"" said WestJet spokeswoman Julia Kaiser in an email.

On the plus side, Canadians' appetite for winter air travel has persisted, despite trips that are farther from home and sometimes harder on the wallet.

Air Canada launched more than a dozen fresh routes and several new destinations in the Caribbean and South America — Rio de Janeiro, Guatemala City, and Cartagena, Colombia, among them — over the last few months.

Some beachy getaway spots saw massive surges. WestJet increased flights to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic last quarter to 1,018 from 320 a year earlier.

Canadian flight volumes to Cancun, Mexico, jumped by 35 per cent, and to Central America by nearly a third last quarter. This quarter, they're poised to leap by 104 per cent for the Bahamas, 36 per cent for Brazil, and 28 per cent for Aruba, according to Cirium.

""Canadians are moving and they're trying different destinations,"" Gradek said.

Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer, stressed that the downturn in tourist travel to the U.S. is ""not catastrophic,"" with the decline in its U.S. flight volumes holding steady at about 10 per cent through most of last year and into 2026.

“We see a plateau. The situation has not worsened,"" he said in a phone interview.

Meanwhile, Americans continue to flock to Canada by air. The tally rose more than six per cent year-over-year to 448,000 in October, according to Statistics Canada. And residents of both countries still touch down on each other's turf for layovers on flights to Europe and Asia, keeping planes largely full.

Canadians' thirst for trips to Europe is only partly linked to their aversion to America, Galardo added.

""We're seeing a lot of demand growth into European leisure destinations,"" he said. Hence new routes to Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.

In the U.S., the airline has swapped in smaller planes and lowered flight frequencies to airports in southern states, and even dropped a few routes, he noted.

For its part, Porter had to pivot drastically last year amid a rapid fleet expansion that hinged largely on growth in U.S. markets.

More than 40 per cent of its flight volume stemmed from American trips a year ago, versus just over a quarter now, according to vice-president of network planning Andrew Pierce.

The country's third-largest airline flew zero routes beyond Canada and the U.S. in January 2025; this month it will fly about 500 — to Cancun and Puerto Vallarta in Mexico as well as Costa Rica and the Cayman Islands.

""We're new to a lot of that region of the world, but it's exactly the right timing for the demand,"" Pierce said.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the “Company”), healthcare’s leading, most comprehensive innovation powerhouse, today announced a voluntary agreement with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The joint agreement meets the requests laid out by President Trump to the industry and provides the Company’s pharmaceutical products an exemption from tariffs1.

“Today’s agreement shows that when the public and private sectors work together towards shared goals, we can deliver real results for patients and the U.S. economy,” said Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “I’m proud that Johnson & Johnson is answering President Trump’s call to lower drug prices for everyday Americans while maintaining our role in improving and saving lives and ensuring that the United States continues to lead the world in healthcare innovation.”

Improving Access and Lowering Costs for U.S. Patients

Johnson & Johnson is working with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The Company is:

Participating in TrumpRx.gov, a direct to patient platform, which will allow millions of American patients to purchase medicines from Johnson & Johnson at significantly discounted rates.

Enabling American patients to access medicines at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Providing Medicaid program access at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Continuing to support the Administration's efforts to ensure better recognition of the value of health care across developed markets globally.

Delivering On Our $55B U.S. Investment

Johnson & Johnson also continues to deliver on our previously announced $55 billion investment to support U.S. manufacturing, research and development, and technology investments by early 2029. In just the last 10 months, the Company has initiated billions of dollars in investment in U.S. manufacturing, which will support the Company’s goal of manufacturing the vast majority of its advanced medicines in the U.S. to meet the needs of U.S. patients.

Today, as part of the $55 billion investment, the Company is announcing two new U.S. manufacturing facilities, including a next generation cell therapy manufacturing site in Pennsylvania and a state-of-the-art drug product manufacturing facility in North Carolina.

Additionally, construction is progressing on our $2 billion state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina, which the Company broke ground on last year. That project will create approximately 5,000 skilled manufacturing and construction jobs in the state. Johnson & Johnson is already ramping up the hiring of advanced manufacturing employees to work at the facility.

In September, the Company also secured a new 160,000+ square foot dedicated biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The $2 billion commitment over the next 10 years will create approximately 120 new jobs in North Carolina.

Johnson & Johnson expects to announce additional U.S. investments later this year.

Prospectus Supplement dated November 16, 2023Prospectus dated April 12, 2024

The notes are not deposits or savings accounts and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

The Notes

The notes are debt securities of Morgan Stanley. We describe the basic features of these notes in the sections of the accompanying prospectus called “Description of Debt Securities—Fixed Rate Debt Securities” and prospectus supplement called “Description of Notes,” subject to and as modified by the provisions described below. All payments on the notes are subject to the credit risk of Morgan Stanley.

The stated principal amount and issue price of each note is $1,000. This price includes costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes, which are borne by you, and, consequently, the estimated value of the notes on the pricing date will be less than the issue price. We estimate that the value of each note on the pricing date will be approximately $976.50 or within $56.50 of that estimate. Our estimate of the value of the notes as determined on the pricing date will be set forth in the final pricing supplement.

What goes into the estimated value on the pricing date?

In valuing the notes on the pricing date, we take into account that the notes comprise both a debt component and a performance-based component linked to interest rates. The estimated value of the notes is determined using our own pricing and valuation models, market inputs and assumptions relating to volatility and other factors including current and expected interest rates, as well as an interest rate related to our secondary market credit spread, which is the implied interest rate at which our conventional fixed rate debt trades in the secondary market.

What determines the economic terms of the notes?

In determining the economic terms of the notes, including the interest rate applicable to each interest payment period, we use an internal funding rate, which is likely to be lower than our secondary market credit spreads and therefore advantageous to us. If the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging costs borne by you were lower or if the internal funding rate were higher, one or more of the economic terms of the securities would be more favorable to you.

What is the relationship between the estimated value on the pricing date and the secondary market price of the notes?

The price at which MS & Co. purchases the notes in the secondary market, absent changes in market conditions, including those related to interest rates, may vary from, and be lower than, the estimated value on the pricing date, because the secondary market price takes into account our secondary market credit spread as well as the bid-offer spread that MS & Co. would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type, the costs of unwinding the related hedging transactions and other factors.

MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the notes and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time.

Risk Factors

The notes involve risks not associated with an investment in ordinary fixed rate notes. This section describes the material risks relating to the notes. For a complete list of risk factors, please see the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus. Investors should consult their financial and legal advisers as to the risks entailed by an investment in the notes and the suitability of the notes in light of their particular circumstances.

Risks Relating to an Investment in the Notes

￭Investors are subject to our credit risk, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the notes. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the notes on interest payment dates and at maturity and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. The notes are not guaranteed by any other entity. If we default on our obligations under the notes, your investment would be at risk and you could lose some or all of your investment. As a result, the market value of the notes prior to maturity will be affected by changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any actual or anticipated decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes.

￭The price at which the notes may be sold prior to maturity will depend on a number of factors and may be substantially less than the amount for which they were originally purchased. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to: (i) actual or anticipated changes in interest and yield rates, (ii) any actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads and (iii) time remaining to maturity.Generally, the longer the time remaining to maturity and the more tailored the exposure, the more the market price of the notes will be affected by the other factors described in the preceding sentence. This can lead to significant adverse changes in the market price of securities like the notes. Depending on the actual or anticipated level of interest and yield rates, the market value of the notes is expected to decrease and you may receive substantially less than 100% of the issue price if you are able to sell your notes prior to maturity.

￭The rate we are willing to pay for securities of this type, maturity and issuance size is likely to be lower than the rate implied by our secondary market credit spreads and advantageous to us. Both the lower rate and the inclusion of costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes in the original issue price reduce the economic terms of the notes, cause the estimated value of the notes to be less than the original issue price and will adversely affect secondary market prices. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors, the prices, if any, at which dealers, including MS & Co., are willing to purchase the notes in secondary market transactions will likely be significantly lower than the original issue price, because secondary market prices will exclude the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging-related costs that are included in the original issue price and borne by you and because the secondary market prices will reflect our secondary market credit spreads and the bid-offer spread that any dealer would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type, the costs of unwinding the related hedging transactions as well as other factors.

The inclusion of the costs of issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes in the original issue price and the lower rate we are willing to pay as issuer make the economic terms of the notes less favorable to you than they otherwise would be.

￭The estimated value of the notes is determined by reference to our pricing and valuation models, which may differ from those of other dealers and is not a maximum or minimum secondary market price. These pricing and valuation models are proprietary and rely in part on subjective views of certain market inputs and certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, because there is no market-standard way to value these types of securities, our models may yield a higher estimated value of the notes than those generated by others, including other dealers in the market, if they attempted to value the notes. In addition, the estimated value on the pricing date does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which dealers, including MS & Co., would be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The value of your notes at any time after the date of this pricing supplement will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including our creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.

￭The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore, there may be little or no secondary market for the notes. MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the notes and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time. When it does make a market, it will generally do so for transactions of routine secondary market size at prices based on its estimate of the current value of the notes, taking into account its bid/offer spread, our credit spreads, market volatility, the notional size of the proposed sale, the cost of unwinding any related hedging positions, the time remaining to maturity and the likelihood that it will be able to resell the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Since other broker-dealers may not participate significantly in the secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which MS & Co. is willing to transact. If, at any time, MS & Co. were to cease making a market in the notes, it is likely that there would be no secondary market for the notes. Accordingly, you should be willing to hold your notes to maturity.

Use of Proceeds and Hedging

The proceeds we receive from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes. We will receive, in aggregate, $1,000 per note issued, because, when we enter into hedging transactions in order to meet our obligations under the notes, our hedging counterparty will reimburse the cost of the Agent’s commissions. The costs of the notes borne by you and described on page 2 above comprise the Agent’s commissions and the cost of issuing, structuring and hedging the notes.

Supplemental Information Concerning Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of Interest

The agent may distribute the notes through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley Wealth Management”), as selected dealer, or other dealers, which may include Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”) and Bank Morgan Stanley AG. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, MSIP and Bank Morgan Stanley AG are affiliates of Morgan Stanley. Selected dealers, including Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, and their financial advisors will collectively receive from the agent, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, a fixed sales commission of $ for each note they sell; provided that dealers selling to investors purchasing the notes in fee-based advisory accounts will not receive a sales commission with respect to such notes.

MS & Co. is our wholly owned subsidiary and it and other subsidiaries of ours expect to make a profit by selling, structuring and, when applicable, hedging the notes. When MS & Co. prices this offering of notes, it will determine the economic terms of the notes such that for each note the estimated value on the pricing date will be no lower than the minimum level described in “The Notes” on page 2.

MS & Co. will conduct this offering in compliance with the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., which is commonly referred to as FINRA, regarding a FINRA member firm’s distribution of the securities of an affiliate and related conflicts of interest. MS & Co. or any of our other affiliates may not make sales in this offering to any discretionary account.

Acceleration Amount in Case of an Event of Default

In case an event of default with respect to the notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per note upon any acceleration of the notes shall be an amount in cash equal to the stated principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In its decision letter, the agency acknowledges the controlled clinical trials submitted by Vanda demonstrates positive efficacy signals.
Following the legal proceeding, in October 2025, the agency and Vanda agreed to a re-review of its supplemental new drug application (NDA) conducted under a collaborative framework agreement between the two parties.
Under the agreement, the agency committed to an expedited re-review of the application by January 7, 2026, including considerations of narrower, sleep-focused indications.

In its decision letter, the agency acknowledges the controlled clinical trials submitted by Vanda demonstrates positive efficacy signals. However, FDA determined that the data did not constitute substantial evidence of effectiveness for jet lag disorder.1

The decision comes against the backdrop of previous legal proceedings, as in August 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside FDA’s earlier refusal to approve of Hetlioz for jet lag disorder. The court characterized Vanda’s evidence as “specific, reasoned, and rooted in evidence,” while labeling the FDA’s earlier review as “cursory,” noting statistically significant improvements on primary endpoints across trials.

Following the legal proceeding, in October 2025, the agency and Vanda agreed to a re-review of its supplemental new drug application (NDA) conducted under a collaborative framework agreement between the two parties. Under the agreement, the agency committed to an expedited re-review of the application by January 7, 2026, including considerations of narrower, sleep-focused indications.

How did FDA come to its decision?

FDA based its conclusion on its assessment of the controlled phase advance protocols used in the studies, specifically five-hour and eight-hour shifts in bedtime, claiming the shifts do not sufficiently reflect real-world jet travel.1 The agency cited several aspects associated with air travel, such as reduced cabin pressure, physical constraints, noise, and lighting changes, as elements not captured by the study designs.1

Vanda continues to dispute FDA’s interpretation, highlighting the widespread use of phase advance models in circadian rhythm research as established methods for simulating the core biological misalignment associated with eastward jet lag.1 The company has maintained its stance, saying that the models isolate circadian disruption without introducing additional variables related to travel conditions. The company also cited data from studies involving both simulated protocols and actual transatlantic travel, saying the data demonstrates improvements in sleep duration, time to persistent sleep, and next-day alertness.1

The company further noted that Hetlioz has an established safety profile which is supported by more than a decade of market experience in its approved chronic indications, including adverse events described as predominantly mild.

Vanda maintains that its submission met the statutory standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness on clinically relevant endpoints for jet lag disorder.

Although Vanda stated that it welcomed FDA’s engagement during the re-review process, the company does not believe the latest decision fully reflects the court’s concerns regarding engagement with the evidence, with Vanda saying it intends to continue discussions with the agency while considering additional steps related to the application.1This includes the company saying it will “pursue all appropriate avenues” in order to advance the approval of Hetlioz.

The company got into the space early, focusing the design of its chips to suit this technology, and that's resulted in a No. 1 position in the market. As a result, Nvidia's revenue has soared, and the stock price has followed as investors rushed to get in on this success story. Nvidia shares have advanced 1,100% over the past three years.

Though this picture is bright, investors still look expectantly to Nvidia for signs of what's next -- and what may keep the revenue momentum going. After all, the company isn't alone in this dynamic space. It faces mounting competition from rivals such as Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. And it even faces the possibility that customers such as Alphabet will rely more heavily on their in-house designed chips and buy fewer Nvidia products down the road.

Just this week, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang spoke at the consumer electronics event known as CES, a forum for product announcements and innovation updates, and he offered a clear picture of what's ahead for the company. In fact, Huang delivered brilliant news to Nvidia investors for 2026.

Nvidia's promise

First, though, it's important to take a quick look at the Nvidia story so far and a promise the company has made to customers and investors. As mentioned, Nvidia was first to market with its graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI, and this helped the company establish leadership. These GPUs drive the critical steps needed to get the AI show on the road, from the training of models to putting them to work.

Nvidia didn't stop there and instead added a wide selection of related products and services to its repertoire -- and that has made it a source that customers can turn to for any of their AI needs. The company also has been proactive, designing platforms in areas such as robotics to drive the AI developments of the future.

At the same time, Nvidia made a promise several quarters ago to those depending on it for technology and growth. The company pledged to update its GPUs on an annual basis, and it's followed through on that with the launch of the Blackwell architecture in late 2024 and then the Blackwell Ultra update last year. Both products met with enormous demand, generating billions of dollars for Nvidia.

Jensen Huang at CES

And this brings me to Huang's announcement at CES. It's as simple as this: The company's Rubin platform is in full production. That puts this next update on track for release this year, once again fulfilling Nvidia's promise. Rubin features five innovations, including the latest NVLink communications link and the Vera central processing unit (CPU). (CPUs are the main chips that power computers.)

But this isn't the only chip involved. In fact, Rubin includes six chips all designed together, in a process called ""extreme codesign"" -- and this has resulted in tremendous gains in efficiency. This integration of chips allows Rubin to offer benefits such as reducing inference token costs by as much as 10 times, and its switch systems help Rubin to offer major improvements in power efficiency and uptime.

So, this platform sounds solid -- but why is this announcement such fantastic news right now? There are three reasons. First, it's yet another example of Nvidia keeping its word and demonstrating that it can innovate and launch a major product on an annual basis. Second, innovations are key because they are what should keep Nvidia in its leadership position. It will be very difficult for a rival to beat Nvidia when new launches happen once a year.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849808%2Fgettyimages-1335027284.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-08 20:02:00.823286

With the docking of Mt New Renown, which has a total cargo capacity of 3.3 lakh m3 (meter cube), Mundra became the first port in India to handle Fully Laden VLCC at Berth, the Adani Group company said in a statement.

The handling of Mt New Renown was executed under challenging conditions with strong currents, winds and sea states, showcasing expertise, coordination and operational excellence of the APSEZ marine team and port management.

Mundra’s VLCC jetty is seamlessly connected via a 489 km crude oil pipeline to the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery at Barmer — one of India’s most strategic refining assets.

This direct connectivity significantly enhances India’s energy security; efficiency of large-scale crude imports; supply chain resilience; and regional economic growth across Gujarat and Rajasthan.

With this achievement, Mundra Port is now among select global crude handling hubs, strengthening India’s position in the global maritime and energy map. Mundra’s advanced vessel-handling capability eliminates dependency on offshore Single Point Moorings (SPMs) or lightering operations that were traditionally used for such large vessels, said the company.

“This development also highlights Mundra’s significance as the first port in the country and among a select few in the world to have a dedicated jetty capable of directly berthing fully laden VLCCs,” it added.

Mundra Port features 27 operational berths and two Single Point Moorings (SPMs); capability to handle dry bulk, break-bulk, project cargo, liquids, containers, automobiles, and crude oil and accommodation of Cape size vessels, VLCCs and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCCs) and ultra large container vessels (ULCVs).

Mundra became the first port in India to handle over 200 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cargo in a single year in 2024-25, reinforcing its unmatched scale and operational leadership.

If the Court is looking for an opportunity to bring coherence to FLSA collective actions, Richards is it.","As the Supreme Court prepares its docket for the New Year, Richards v. Eli Lilly stands out as a case with the potential to fundamentally alter the landscape of wage-and-hour collective actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).[1] At issue is a deceptively simple but deeply consequential question: What must a plaintiff show before a federal court may authorize notice to other employees in a collective action under FLSA § 216(b)?

The Court is scheduled to consider the employer’s Petition at conference this Friday. A grant of certiorari could signal its readiness to address a three-way circuit split that has only deepened in recent years, and to clarify a procedural regime that, for decades, has evolved largely through lower-court innovation unmoored to the FLSA’s text and without any Supreme Court guidance.

This alert summarizes the Supreme Court filings and assesses why the Court’s odds of taking up the case are higher than in an average cert petition.

Why Richards Is on the Supreme Court’s Radar

The FLSA’s collective-action mechanism is unique in federal law. Section 216(b) allows employees to sue on behalf of others who are “similarly situated,” but—unlike Rule 23 class actions—requires affirmative opt-in. The statute is silent on when and how courts should determine similarity, what evidentiary showing is required, and how much scrutiny should occur before court-authorized notice issues.

This statutory silence has produced a fractured legal landscape. That’s why the question presented in Richards is procedural but pivotal: What evidentiary standard governs a district court’s decision to authorize notice to putative collective members under § 216(b)? Lower courts have adopted at least four divergent approaches:

Lenient “modest showing” standard traditionally derived from Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. (D.N.J. 1987),

Fifth Circuit’s preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in Swales v. KLLM Transport Services (2021),

Sixth Circuit’s “strong likelihood” standard in Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC (2023),

Seventh Circuit’s “material factual dispute” standard in Richards v. Eli Lilly (2025).

These approaches differ not only in name but in substance. Some require meaningful discovery and early adjudication of contested facts, while others allow notice on largely untested allegations in a rubber-stamp approach to notice. The inconsistency affects litigation risk, discovery burdens, and settlement incentives for employers nationwide.[2]

Richards arrives at a moment when the tensions between the circuits’ varying approaches are impossible to ignore, and the Supreme Court’s intervention could bring long-overdue clarity.

The FLSA Issues Teed Up for Review

Is Court-Authorized Notice a Meaningful Judicial Act—or a Ministerial Step?

Eli Lilly’s petition argues that authorizing notice is not a neutral or inconsequential act. Once a trial court authorizes notice to putative members of the collective, wage and hour lawsuits often expand dramatically, discovery costs soar, and settlement pressure intensifies. The Petition challenges the Lusardi premise that notice can be issued on minimal evidence because it is “preliminary,” and urges the Court to treat notice as a meaningful judicial act requiring rigorous analysis.

What Does “Similarly Situated” Require—And When?

The circuits disagree not only on how much evidence is required, but also on when similarity must be evaluated:

Fifth Circuit: Requires courts to resolve similarity before notice by a preponderance of the evidence.

Sixth Circuit: Demands a “strong likelihood” of similarity.

Seventh Circuit: Adopts a “material factual dispute” standard, allowing more discretion.

Each standard reflects a fundamentally different view of § 216(b): Is similarity a threshold gatekeeping requirement, or can it be postponed until after notice has already reshaped the litigation?

How Much Discretion Should District Courts Have?

Richards’ opposition brief emphasizes district court discretion and argues that variability is a feature, not a flaw. Eli Lilly and its amici, by contrast, frame unfettered discretion as the problem—arguing that without a uniform rule, outcomes depend more on geography than law.

The Supreme Court Filings: A National Debate

Eli Lilly’s Petition for Certiorari frames Richards as an opportunity to address foundational questions about the role of courts in FLSA collective actions. The employer argues for clarifying the implications that arise from Hoffmann-La Roche or, at minimum, requiring rigorous proof of similarity before notice. In response, Richards defends the Seventh Circuit’s “middle-ground” approach as reasonable and consistent with congressional intent.

The parties to the case are not the only ones who have voiced their arguments in favor and in opposition to certiorari. One of the most significant developments at the cert-stage is the sheer number and nature of the amicus briefs supporting review. Six separate amicus briefs have been filed in support of the petition. These briefs come from a diverse array of stakeholders including major business trade associations, employer groups, and public policy organizations across the country.

Among the six amicus briefs supporting Eli Lilly, the brief filed by the State of Ohio—joined by 19 other states and the Arizona Legislature—stands out. The 20 states made several important points in favor of granting Eli Lilly’s Petition:

Sovereign and Fiscal Impact: The brief emphasizes that states, as large employers, are increasingly targeted by FLSA collective actions. The amici argue that the current regime—where courts can authorize notice to non-parties based on minimal evidence—imposes “steep costs” on state treasuries and undermines states’ ability to govern their workforces.

Constitutional Concerns: The brief contends that court-facilitated notice to non-parties exceeds the traditional bounds of judicial power under Article III, as it invites individuals who are not yet parties into litigation, contrary to the adversarial model.

Statutory Silence: The amici highlight that neither the FLSA nor the ADEA authorizes courts to recruit new plaintiffs, and that the judicially created notice regime is untethered from statutory text or historical practice.

Patchwork Standards and Forum-shopping: The brief underscores the practical problems caused by the circuit split, noting that the lack of a uniform standard encourages forum-shopping and creates unpredictability for employers nationwide.

The amici urge the Court to adopt a clear, rigorous standard for notice that protects both public and private employers from the burdens of overbroad collective actions.

Why the Certiorari Posture Is Unusually Strong

Estimating certiorari odds is inherently speculative, but several predictors of Supreme Court review that serve as useful guideposts are present here:

Deep, Acknowledged Circuit Split: At least three courts of appeals have adopted distinct and incompatible standards, and the Seventh Circuit expressly declined to follow either of the others. The result is a patchwork regime that virtually invites forum-shopping.

Significant Amicus Engagement: Six amicus briefs at the cert stage—particularly in a procedural employment case—signal broad national importance. The Ohio-led brief, joined by South Carolina and other states, highlights the issue’s impact on public sector employers.

Squarely Presented Legal Question: The opposition brief defends the Seventh Circuit’s rule on the merits, confirming that the legal question is squarely presented and vigorously contested.

Beyond the merits presented by the Petition, Richards aligns with the Court’s broader institutional priorities. For example, the Court has shown increasing interest in ensuring that procedural shortcuts do not effectively determine case outcomes. The Court has also reinforced the importance of text, structure, and historical practice in interpreting the role and authority of the courts, a factor that weighs in favor of a narrow construction of the collective-action mechanism of § 216. And if those fail, the Court has shown an interest in creating uniform federal procedure to limit forum-shopping incentivized by the current three-way split, which undermines predictability for employers and employees alike.

What to Watch Going Forward

If the Court grants certiorari, Richards could become the most significant FLSA procedural decision since Hoffmann-La Roche. The Court could:

Clarify Hoffmann-La Roche: Eliminating court-facilitated notice would fundamentally reshape FLSA collective actions.

Adopt a Uniform, Heightened Standard: Requiring plaintiffs to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence (or a “strong likelihood”), that others are similarly situated before notice issues.

Endorse the Seventh Circuit’s Middle-Ground Approach: Allowing for more judicial discretion but requiring consideration of both sides’ evidence.

Maintain the Status Quo: Leaving the current forum-dependent landscape—and its attendant risks—in place.

For employers, the stakes are high: A Supreme Court decision could recalibrate early-stage leverage in collective actions, reshape notice practices nationwide, and provide long-overdue clarity on the meaning of “similarly situated” under § 216(b). The case is worth close attention not because it guarantees a particular outcome, but because it presents the Court with a clean vehicle to impose order on an increasingly fractured area of wage-and-hour law.

Conclusion

Richards v. Eli Lilly is not just another employment dispute—it is a strong candidate for review. The combination of a three-way circuit split, significant amicus engagement, and a fundamental disagreement over how courts should administer a core federal statute makes this case one to watch closely as the Court shapes its 2026 docket.

If the Court is looking for an opportunity to bring coherence to FLSA collective actions, Richards is it.

Sign up Stay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.","As new Walmart CEO John Furner prepares to take over from Doug McMillon in February, Furner can expect the retail giant’s artificial intelligence (AI) and agentic commerce strategies to come up frequently as he decides how to best put agents and machine learning to use.

“Every job we’ve got is going to change in some way — whether it’s getting the shopping carts off the parking lot, or the way our technologists work, or certainly the way leadership roles change,” McMillon said during a Harvard Business Review event in November, according to an Axios report from that day.

That statement came toward the end of a big year for Walmart’s AI endeavors, which already stretched across its operations from online and omnichannel shopping to how its employees work at stores and build internal tools to benefit the organization. In addition to developing its own AI and machine learning capabilities, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also works with OpenAI in key areas that factor into its plans for 2026.

How Walmart is using AI for its agents and ‘super agents’

Suresh Kumar, the global chief technology officer and chief development officer at Walmart, used the phrase “super agents” to describe how Walmart is using AI not just to enhance customer service and experience, but also to manage lesser AI agents in targeted areas with larger agents that operate at higher levels.

“We’ve been building agents — fast — for every aspect of the business,” he wrote in a July 2025 LinkedIn post.

Walmart gave those super agents their own names:

Sparky, which is Walmart’s virtual assistant for shoppers.

My Assistant, a tool that Walmart associates use for tasks ranging from scheduling meetings to engaging with data sets.

Marty, which assists Walmart partners and will play an increasing role in advertising.

WIBEY, a super agent designed to help Walmart developers.

In addition, Walmart created a generative AI-powered assistant named Wally, which it built to aid employees with merchandising tasks.

What is ChatGPT’s role in agentic commerce for Walmart?

At the beginning of the 2025 holiday shopping season, Walmart announced a major expansion of its work with OpenAI, which Walmart called “agentic commerce in action.” Previously, Walmart detailed that it would collaborate with OpenAI on certification and training through the Walmart Academy program. In the latest partnership, consumers can purchase Walmart products within OpenAI’s ChatGPT experience.

That functionality includes the use of ChatGPT’s “instant checkout” experience for completing purchases. Walmart followed early adopters Etsy and Shopify to begin making use of the option.

Walmart web sales by year

Internal AI resources

Even as a super agent, WIBEY was built on top of Element, which is Walmart’s proprietary machine learning platform. Designed to use Kubernetes, Walmart uses Element to support technology deployments across multiple cloud-based contexts, as well as for hardware-accelerated experiments and integrations with enterprise services.

“Element is purpose-built to support the full lifecycle of intelligent workflows, from experimentation to production at scale,” wrote Sravana Karnati, executive vice president of global technology platforms at Walmart Global Tech, in an August 2025 blog post. “Designed for distributed, scalable, and production-ready AI, Element simplifies infrastructure, accelerates development, and empowers teams to focus on delivering impact.”

The scope of these efforts speaks to multiple layers of technology that a company the size of Walmart is able to use, as well as the wide reach those systems have across its various divisions.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

While Albertsons Companies currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","Albertsons Companies NYSE: ACI presents a compelling value proposition in 2026, but the question is whether it is an opportunity for investors, and the signs suggest it is. While price action is bearish, results are outperforming expectations, and stock accumulation is underway. The company’s Q3 earnings report highlights continued outperformance versus expectations, reinforcing the bullish case despite bearish price action.

It is only a matter of time before this stock price reconnects with reality, and when it does, the gains that follow could be explosive. Semi-explosive, at least.

This isn’t exactly a high-growth story. We’re talking about a value-and-yield combination that suggests a high double-digit total return by the end of 2026 and the potential for a sustained rally as growth is reinvigorated.

Albertsons Presents a Favorable Value-and-Yield Combination

On a value basis, Albertsons trades at only 8x its current-year earnings outlook and 6x the 2030 consensus forecast, a discount relative to its peers every way you look at it. There are not many publicly traded direct competitors; Kroger NYSE: KR is number one, and Albertsons is number two. Kroger, the larger of the two, trades at 12x this year’s earnings and 10x the 2030 consensus, suggesting a minimum 50% upside is possible for ACI stock. Other comparisons, including those with regional player Ingles Markets NASDAQ: IMKTA and big-box stores such as Walmart NASDAQ: WMT and Costco NASDAQ: COST, reveal even more favorable valuations.

Thedividend yield heightens the value. Albertsons pays a reliable 60 cents as of early 2026, yielding approximately 3.5%, compared to a competitor range that tops out under 3%. The highest-yielding competitor is regional grocer Village Super Markets; the critical comparison is to Kroger, which yields about 2.25% with a similar payout ratio. Albertsons' dividend payout is under 30% of the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) earnings consensus, according to MarketBeat, and the company has exceeded its targets every quarter so far.

Value and yield are among the reasons why the institutions accumulated in 2025. The data reveals mixed activity in Q4, with selling outpacing buying ever so slightly, but bullish behavior for the year. Institutions bought on balance each quarter at a pace of approximately $3 for each $1 sold and are likely to continue accumulating in 2026. The forecast is for this company to sustain its modest growth pace and to widen margins.

Tepid Guidance Sends ACI Shares to New Lows

Albertsons' Q4 FY2025 guidance fell short of the consensus, sending shares to new lows. However, the guidance adjustment merely narrowed the range, forecasting a mid-point slightly below the consensus. The takeaway is that growth is expected, including earnings, sustaining the capital return outlook. Data in the report also reveals strengths, including in comparable sales, digital channels, and loyalty, which underpin growth across the retail universe. The likely outcome is that Q4 guidance is cautious, and that a catalyst for a rebound may emerge before mid-year.

Catalysts in 2026 include the company’s strategic shift, increased loyalty engagement, and improved clarity now that the Kroger merger issues are behind it. The strategic shift focuses on digital, specifically its retail media network, which helps the grocery company leverage its growing loyalty base. The retail media network enables the company to sell ad space on its websites and apps, targeting specific shoppers and is a higher-margin business.

Albertsons Stock Overextends After Q3 Release

Albertsons' stock price has been under pressure for many quarters and is overextended in early 2026. Both the MACD and stochastic indicators reflect significant divergences, suggesting that a lack of buyers, rather than a dearth of sellers, is driving the market. In this scenario, the stock price is set up to rebound sharply and could do so at any time. The risk is that ACI stock will continue to drift lower until later in the year when more news is available. In that scenario, it could move to the post-IPO lows near $14 before rebounding.

But a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist on Tuesday might give investors pause.

The chart, shared in a client note from Société Générale's Albert Edwards, shows the US unemployment rate (in red) alongside its three-year moving average (dotted line). Since 1950, in eight instances where the unemployment rate has begun an uptrend and broken through its three-year moving average, a recession has followed.

""Recession is the biggest threat to equities, although in recent downturns financial problems have preceded (or caused) recessions,"" Edwards wrote in the note. ""I don't think any guru is forecasting a recession in 2026. Yet the simple correlation shown below has a 100% track record of success.""

The chart mirrors the concept of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which says that the US economy is in a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5% from its lows over the previous 12 months. In other words, if unemployment rises too quickly, it signals that things are about to get worse.

Although it had been hailed for its back-tested accuracy since its release in 2019, the gauge produced its first false reading in August 2024.

It remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen. Hiring rates and job openings remain sluggish. But other important measures of the economy's health — like consumer spending and GDP growth — remain strong.

Another signal that a recession could be on the way, according to Edwards, is a steepening of the Treasury yield curve following its inversion. However, while falling short-term rates following an inversion are usually accompanied by a floundering job market and consumer, today's economy seems to be in a stronger starting place.",https://i.insider.com/695ec1f064858d02d217f102?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 17:14:24.815320

Risk Considerations

The risks set forth below are discussed in more detail in the “Risk Factors” section in the preliminary pricing supplement. Please review those risk factors carefully prior to making an investment decision.

Risks Relating to Return Characteristics

▪The securities do not guarantee the return of any principal and your investment in the securities may result in a loss.

▪The contingent payment, if any, is based solely on the closing prices of the underlying equity on the specified determination dates.

▪You will not receive any contingent payment for any period where the closing price of the underlying equity on the determination date is less than the downside threshold level.

▪Higher contingent payments are generally associated with a greater risk of loss.

▪Early redemption risk.

▪Investors will not participate in any appreciation in the closing price of the underlying equity and will not have the same rights as holders of the underlying equity.

Risks Relating to Characteristics of the Underlying Equity

▪Single equity risk.

▪There can be no assurance that the investment view implicit in the securities will be successful.

▪No affiliation with the underlying equity issuer.

Estimated Value Considerations

▪The issue price you pay for the securities will exceed their estimated initial value.

▪The estimated initial value is a theoretical price and the actual price that you may be able to sell your securities in any secondary market (if any) at any time after the pricing date may differ from the estimated initial value.

▪Our actual profits may be greater or less than the differential between the estimated initial value and the issue price of the securities as of the pricing date.

Risks Relating to Liquidity and Secondary Market Price Considerations

▪There may be little or no secondary market for the securities.

▪The price at which UBS Securities LLC and its affiliates may offer to buy the securities in the secondary market (if any) may be greater than UBS’ valuation of the securities at that time, greater than any other secondary market prices provided by unaffiliated dealers (if any) and, depending on your broker, greater than the valuation provided on your customer account statements.

▪Price of securities prior to maturity.

▪Impact of fees and the use of internal funding rates rather than secondary market credit spreads on secondary market prices.

Risks Relating to Hedging Activities and Conflicts of Interest

▪Potential conflicts of interest.

▪Hedging and trading activities by the calculation agent and its affiliates could potentially affect the value of, and any amounts payable on, the securities.

▪We may engage in business with or involving the underlying equity issuer without regard to your interests.

▪Potential UBS impact on an underlying equity.

▪Following certain events, the calculation agent can make adjustments to the underlying equity and terms of the securities that may adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the securities.

Risks Relating to General Credit Characteristics

▪The securities are subject to the credit risk of UBS, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the securities.

▪The securities are not bank deposits.

▪If UBS experiences financial difficulties, FINMA has the power to open restructuring or liquidation proceedings in respect of, and/or impose protective measures in relation to, UBS, which proceedings or measures may have a material adverse effect on the terms and market value of the securities and/or the ability of UBS to make payments thereunder.

Risks Relating to U.S. Federal Income Taxation

▪Uncertain tax treatment. Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” in the preliminary pricing supplement and “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”, including the section “— Securities Treated as Prepaid Derivatives or Prepaid Forwards with Associated Contingent Coupons”, in the accompanying product supplement.

Trial to resolve all claims in the Anaptys and Tesaro/GSK dispute is scheduled for July 14-17, 2026

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 08, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AnaptysBio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANAB), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative immunology therapeutics, filed a partial motion to dismiss Tesaro’s anticipatory breach of contract claim in Delaware Chancery Court related to pending litigation between Anaptys, GSK, and TESARO, Inc. (“Tesaro”) regarding their Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”), which entitles Anaptys to receive royalties upon sales of Jemperli .

As previously disclosed, Anaptys approached Tesaro to engage in good faith discussions to potentially resolve Anaptys’ claims that Tesaro and GSK had breached the Collaboration Agreement. On Nov. 20, 2025, Tesaro, without notice to Anaptys and with discussions ongoing, initiated a lawsuit against Anaptys, claiming that Anaptys had repudiated the Collaboration Agreement and seeking a declaration that Tesaro had not breached.

In response, Anaptys filed its own Complaint in Delaware Chancery Court, requesting a court declaration that Tesaro has materially breached the parties’ Collaboration Agreement and that GSK, Tesaro’s corporate parent, has tortiously interfered with the Collaboration Agreement.

Further, on Dec. 30, 2025, Anaptys filed a Motion to Dismiss Tesaro’s anticipatory breach of contract claim in the same court. The motion, unsealed on Jan. 8, 2026, explains why, as a matter of law, Anaptys has never repudiated the Collaboration Agreement and how Anaptys has only sought to vindicate its contract rights (which cannot be a repudiation). Anaptys’ motion also explains why Delaware’s anti-SLAPP law applies, as the law exists to prevent strategic lawsuits aimed at deterring good‑faith efforts to assert legal rights, such as Tesaro’s lawsuit.

Tesaro and GSK contend that Anaptys’ Motion to Dismiss stays all discovery, a contention that Anaptys strongly opposes as the two companies work toward the scheduled July 14-17 trial date. The court is expected to hear Anaptys’ Motion to Dismiss by early March pursuant to Delaware’s anti-SLAPP law.

About Anaptys’ Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement with Tesaro (an affiliate of GSK)

In March 2014, Anaptys entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Tesaro, an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company now a part of GSK. Currently, under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro is developing Jemperli (dostarlimab) as a monotherapy, and in combination with additional therapies, for various solid tumor indications.

Anaptys is eligible to receive royalties upon sales of Jemperli , equal to 8% of net sales below $1.0 billion, 12% of net sales between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, 20% of net sales between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion and 25% of net sales above $2.5 billion.

The royalty term under this collaboration extends at least through expiration of composition of matter coverage on the molecule which expires in 2035 in the U.S. and in 2036 in the EU.

About Anaptys

Anaptys is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative immunology therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The company’s pipeline includes rosnilimab, a pathogenic T cell depleter, which has completed a Phase 2b trial for rheumatoid arthritis; ANB033, a CD122 antagonist, in a Phase 1b trial for celiac disease with plans to expand development into an additional indication; and ANB101, a BDCA2 modulator, in a Phase 1a trial.

Kumthekar A, Ogdie A. Obesity and Psoriatic Arthritis: A Narrative Review.","Eli Lilly and Company has announced positive topline results from the TOGETHER-PsA trial, a first-of-its-kind phase 3b study evaluating the concomitant use of the IL-17A inhibitor ixekizumab (Taltz) and the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide (Zepbound) in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who also have obesity or overweight with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity.1 These new results suggest that an integrated pharmacologic approach targeting both inflammatory disease activity and excess body weight can deliver superior clinical outcomes compared with biologic therapy alone.

Background

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease associated with progressive joint damage, functional impairment, and a substantial burden of comorbidities. Obesity is highly prevalent among patients with PsA, affecting an estimated 65% of adults in the United States, and is increasingly recognized as a modifier of disease severity, treatment response, and long-term outcomes.2 Despite guideline recommendations to address obesity in PsA management, weight reduction and inflammatory control are typically treated separately in clinical practice.

Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin-17A, a key cytokine involved in psoriatic inflammation, and is approved for the treatment of PsA, plaque psoriasis, and axial spondyloarthritis. Tirzepatide is the only FDA-approved dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for obesity management and has demonstrated robust and sustained weight loss across multiple clinical programs.

Study Design

TOGETHER-PsA was designed to directly test whether concomitant pharmacologic treatment of obesity could enhance PsA outcomes. The 52-week, randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, open-label study enrolled 271 adult patients with active PsA and a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², or BMI 27–29.9 kg/m² with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous ixekizumab alone or in combination with tirzepatide. All patients received standardized counseling on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, ensuring that observed differences reflected pharmacologic effects.

Results

At the 36-week analysis, the study met its primary endpoint, defined as the proportion of participants achieving both a 50% improvement in PsA disease activity, measured by the American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) response, and at least 10% body weight reduction. In the combination arm, 31.7% of patients met this composite endpoint, compared with only 0.8% of patients treated with ixekizumab monotherapy (p < 0.001).

Key secondary endpoints further supported the superiority of the combination regimen. Notably, 33.5% of patients receiving ixekizumab plus tirzepatide achieved an ACR50 response at week 36, compared with 20.4% in the ixekizumab arm, representing a 64% relative increase in response rate (p < 0.05). This improvement in joint and systemic inflammation occurred in a population with high baseline disease burden, including high disease activity, meaningful functional impairment, and an average BMI of 37.6 kg/m². More than 60% of participants had previously been treated with one or more advanced therapies, underscoring the refractory nature of the study population.

Safety Profile

Safety outcomes in TOGETHER-PsA were consistent with the known profiles of both agents. Adverse events in the combination arm were generally mild to moderate. The most common events occurring in at least 5% of patients included gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as injection site reactions. In the ixekizumab monotherapy arm, injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections were most commonly reported. No new safety signals were identified with concomitant use.

Clinical Implications

From a dermatologic perspective, these findings are particularly relevant, as skin disease and systemic inflammation in psoriatic disease are closely linked to metabolic dysfunction. The findings suggest that obesity may act not only as a comorbidity but also as a modifiable driver of inflammatory disease activity in PsA. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and regulatory discussions are planned.

""While treatment guidelines for psoriatic arthritis recommend management of obesity, the reality is these two chronic diseases are often addressed separately and moving the needle in psoriatic arthritis has remained challenging,"" said Joseph F. Merola, MD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Dermatology and Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Rheumatic Diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center. ""The observed benefit with treatment using Taltz and Zepbound appears to meaningfully impact psoriatic disease activity, indicating that for many patients, PsA is an obesity-related condition. This integrated therapy approach represents a potential paradigm shift and could lead to better outcomes for those living with both diseases.""1

Ensure architecture can ingest new metrics (emissions, safety alerts, etc.)","Regulatory pressure has long shaped the terrain in logistics, from emissions limits, to hours of service (HOS), to safety mandates. Today, that terrain is rapidly changing and the view from the windshield is foggy. Pressure has intensified in recent years, driving innovation across fleet design, yard operations, data systems, and autonomous tooling. At the same time, the industry is navigating politically driven regulatory rollbacks that introduce an additional level of complexity.

Logistics managers have no choice but to adapt. Here are key domains to watch and a strategic playbook for staying ahead of disruption.

Policy: The invisible hand behind innovation

Regulatory and policy incentives have a profound influence on logistics trends and innovations. These forces influence where capital flows, which technologies scale fastest, and which legacy practices persist.

Regulators have long treated transportation and logistics as a focus area for environmental protection and improvement, as these sectors account for a disproportionate share of emissions. In a recent example, the EPA’s “Clean Trucks Plan” set ambitious nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas (GHG) limits for model years 2027-2032 to cut emissions per ton-mile by up to 60%.

Safety targets are likewise tightening and, in turn, shaping capital planning for logistics leaders and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) recently proposed a rule requiring new vehicles with a gross vehicle weight exceeding 10,000 lb. to be equipped with automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems to reduce the frequency and severity of rear-end collisions.

However, while safety regulations continue to strengthen, environmental rules now face an uncertain future, leaving logistics managers uncertain about their next steps. The current administration is proposing to unravel GHG Phase 3 standards, rescind the Clean Air Act’s endangerment finding (which underpins federal climate regulation), and revoke GHG mandates for light, medium, and heavy vehicles. In parallel, the administration has nullified rules that permitted California’s more stringent emissions regimes, such as the zero-emission Class 8 truck mandates and heavy-duty nitrous oxide rules, citing regulatory overreach. California’s government responded with a lawsuit and orders for new CARB standards.

Though regulatory rollbacks may scale back updates, don’t expect to see a full reversal. For example, OEMs were preparing for 25-40% of new Class 8 trucks to be zero-emission by 2032, and engineering roadmaps are already in motion.

Questions are also emerging around legacy size and weight limits. The long-standing federal weight limit sits at 80,000 pounds, which effectively caps most loads at roughly 45,000 pound of product. Meanwhile, trailers are 53 feet long today, compared to 48 feet a couple of decades ago. Increasing automation could open the door to new configurations: longer, denser, or modular trailer formats designed to optimize payload, aerodynamics, and autonomous system performance. It may not be long before we see regulators revisit size and weight rules to account for safer, more predictable automated driving systems.

A playbook for navigating uncertainty

Despite uncertainty, the upshot of a softening of enforcement intensity is that fleets may gain some breathing room in capital planning. In the near term, these rollbacks alleviate pressure on fleets that were bracing for a pre-2027 buying surge, formerly anticipated due to strict emissions deadlines. That surge may no longer materialize, bursting a distorting bubble in truck orders.

However, fleet managers cannot defer safety investments, such as collision-avoidance systems, telematics, and driver-assist technology. The dual dynamic of emissions flexibility and safety expectations will require planning agility.

Expect to see gradual, targeted deployment of improvements rather than wholesale fleet conversion. Leading operators will build simulations of their logistics networks, monitoring route shifts, demand disruptions, energy constraints, and new policy regimes. Electric vehicles will gain traction in yards, regional lanes, and controlled operations where charging can be assured. Advanced driver-assistance systems will continue to proliferate, with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, and driver monitoring expanding in high-risk corridors.

Given the push-pull of market, investor, and regulatory forces, how can logistics leaders navigate the bumpy road ahead? Here’s a strategic roadmap to follow:

● Conduct policy scenario planning. Build alternate futures based on tight, relaxed, or mixed regulations, and stress test investment plans against each.

● Invest in data abstraction. Ensure architecture can ingest new metrics (emissions, safety alerts, etc.) for fast pivots if regulatory targets shift.

● Choose modular deployment. Begin with low-regret zones (yards, regional loops, high-density nodes) before scaling to full long-haul conversions.

● Forge industry-regulator engagement. Participate in rulemaking, industry coalitions, or pilot programs so that insights influence realistic standards rather than reactive mandates.

● Protect optionality in fleets. When buying powertrains or vehicles, favor architectures that can be retrofitted or upgraded, not locked into a single technology bet.

● Play the long game. Delaying emissions investments risks stranded assets when standards inevitably rebound.

● Work with your partners. Whether technology, service or consultants, work closely with your partners on what trends, best practices and investments that others are making.

Innovation by design, not by force

Logistics innovation over the next decade will not be a linear march toward a cleaner, safer future; it will be steered by the winds of policy, regulation, and leaders investing in change. Safety regulations are holding strong, requiring immediate attention and investment, while environmental rollbacks may provide a moment of reprieve before kicking back into gear.

Throughout uncertainty, logistics leaders must treat policy as an inspiration for design, not merely a compliance overlay. Resilient platforms, modular capabilities, and intelligent systems will thrive under shifting rules.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/annika-adobestock-589591429.53bB1XEbQs.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-08 19:03:11.541760

New dietary guidelines

It's being touted as ""the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in decades."" Under the direction of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Trump administration has released new dietary guidelines for Americans, looking to address the escalating health costs stemming from chronic illness and the highest level of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in the developed world. The 10-page report is in sharp contrast to the previous 164-page report in not just size, but also revises some past notable recommendations.

Snapshot: The new inverted pyramid is based on protein, dairy, and vegetables and fruits, with whole grains taking a smaller portion of the diagram. Healthy fats are also encouraged, including omega-3-rich seafood, nuts, and avocados, as well as full-fat dairy over low-fat options, and foods to promote ""gut health"" like kimchi and kefir. It additionally takes aim at processed foods and refined carbohydrates, while removing specific daily limits on alcohol, and instead encouraged Americans to ""consume less alcohol for better overall health.""

Meanwhile, war was declared on the sweet stuff. ""No amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended or considered part of a healthy or nutritious diet,"" according to the HHS, which called on parents to completely avoid added sugar for children four years old and younger. While the Sugar Association applauded HHS’s recommendation to limit sugar intake, they objected to how the report overstates and extrapolates the actual science, studying just the relationship between sugar-sweetened beverages and various health outcomes.

Elsewhere: The response from the food industry was predictable, as the American Beverage Association – whose members include Coca-Cola Company (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) – argued that ""Americans deserve pragmatic advice they can use in daily life"" and that the new guidance ""dismisses safe, effective no sugar options, is impractical, and inherently contradictory."" The news weighed slightly on companies whose revenue relies heavily on processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Shares of Hormel (HRL), Conagra Brands (CAG), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and Mondelez (MDLZ) were all trading defensively following the press conference. (52 comments)

Utrecht, The Netherlands-based ViCentra initially closed its Series D in September, bringing in $85 million. The now-closed extension to the financing brings the total raised to $98 million. CEO Tom Arnold explained the company’s plans for a big commercial push with the funds in an interview with Drug Delivery Business News after the initial closing.

ViCentra said the additional funding follows “a strong year of commercial and operational progress.” It includes new capital from ROM Utrecht Region and a consortium of Dutch investors, including Venturing Tech. Existing investor Innovation Industries also took part in the second closing.

The company intends to use funds to scale manufacturing and deepen execution in Germany, the Netherlands and France. It also hopes to accelerate preparations to bring its next-generation Kaleido insulin patch pump to the U.S. market. The company hopes to enter a hot patch pump market, led by Insulet, with potential competitors, like Medtronic/MiniMed, Beta Bionics and Tandem Diabetes Care, are developing their own patch pumps. PharmaSens and SiBionics also recently unveiled their own entry, an all-in-one device, too.

Kaleido, described by the company as the smallest, lightest and most precise insulin patch pump in its class, offers premium materials and customizable aluminum shells in 10 color options to deliver the feel of personal technology rather than a traditional medical device. It integrates with Diabeloop’s self-learning automated insulin delivery algorithm and Dexcom’s leading continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).

“The past year has been transformative for ViCentra,” Arnold said in a news release. “This latest funding enables us to further scale our manufacturing capabilities, strengthen our commercial presence and support in Germany, the Netherlands, and France, and ensures that we remain on course for our planned U.S. market access. Our goal for 2026 is clear: convert our current high demand into satisfied users through uncompromising quality and performance and nearly triple our European user base by the end of 2026.”",https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ViCentra-Kaleido-Blue-worn-on-arm.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:01:55.683678

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.

Convogo’s product will be wound down.

The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.

In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes.

“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”

Here are some innovative uses of CRISPR in agriculture:

Enhanced Fungi for Meat Alternatives

One of the most notable innovative uses of CRISPR in agriculture is the development of genetically engineered fungi that can serve as a sustainable and nutritious meat alternative.

Improved Digestibility and Production Efficiency: Researchers have used CRISPR to modify fungi, making them easier to digest and less resource-intensive to produce. ""Using CRISPR, researchers made a protein packed fungi that’s easier to stomach. The genetically engineered fungus that tastes like meat and could have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional livestock or even “lab-grown” cell-cultured meat.""

Specific Modifications: Scientists from Jiangnan University in China tweaked the DNA of Fusarium venenatum, a fungus already used as a meat alternative, to enhance its nutritional profile and reduce production costs. ""Using CRISPR gene editing technology, researchers from Jiangnan University in China took a fungus that is already used as a meat alternative (Fusarium venenatum) and tweaked its DNA to make it easier to digest and less resource-intensive to produce.""

Environmental and Economic Benefits: This gene-edited fungi requires significantly less sugar to produce the same amount of protein and produces protein much faster than its non-altered counterpart. It also has a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional livestock. ""This new, edited DNA strain required 44 percent less sugar to produce the same amount of protein as a non-genetically altered strain. It was also able to produce protein 88 percent faster than the original version.""

General Applications in Agriculture

CRISPR is also being explored for broader applications in agriculture to improve crop resilience and yield.

Crop Improvement: CRISPR can be used to develop crops that are more resistant to diseases, pests, and harsh environmental conditions, leading to increased yields and reduced need for pesticides. ""Scientists find applications of CRISPR in Agriculture""

Accessibility for Research: The relative ease and affordability of CRISPR kits make it accessible for researchers and even biohackers to experiment with genetic modifications, potentially leading to more innovative agricultural solutions. ""Assuming you have the target transgene or knockout mapped and your guide snippet, they have kits that cost about 500 bucks and only require basic lab equipment to use. They are easy enough to use that if you can follow a cookbook recipe you could crispr something.""

Future Potential

The potential for CRISPR in agriculture is vast, with ongoing research exploring new ways to enhance food production and sustainability.

Addressing Food Demands: Gene-edited foods like the fungi meat alternative can help meet the growing global food demands without the high environmental costs associated with traditional farming. ""Gene-edited foods like this can meet growing food demands without the environmental costs of conventional farming.""

Nutritional Enhancements: CRISPR can be used to improve the nutritional content of crops, such as increasing vitamin levels or protein content. ""the amino acid score and availability is pretty good. i'd eat this if its economically viable to animal proteins.""

More than 230 million people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week, a pattern OpenAI says has been playing out for some time.

Now, it is formalizing that behavior with the launch of ChatGPT Health, which allows users to connect medical records and wellness apps to unify their data and better inform their health-related conversations.

Early integrations span fitness and nutrition platforms, such as Apple Health for movement, sleep and activity data, Function for lab test insights and nutrition guidance and MyFitnessPal for macros and recipes. Weight Watchers is also integrated, with a focus on GLP-1-related meal planning and food guidance.

Additional launch partners include Peloton for suggested workout classes or guided meditations, Instacart for turning meal plans into shoppable grocery lists and AllTrails for activity discovery.

Peloton said the integration gives members a level of personalization that was previously out of reach, allowing ChatGPT Health to make more tailored class recommendations based on medical context, such as injury recovery plans from a doctor or adjusting fitness focus based on cholesterol trends and recent Peloton output.

The partnership, Peloton added, builds on the launch of Peloton IQ, its newer on-device AI coaching system.

In a post announcing the new experience, OpenAI said ChatGPT Health was developed with input from more than 260 physicians and is designed to help users understand health trends and prepare for medical appointments, rather than replace professional care. Notably, medical record integrations and some app connections are U.S.-only for now.

The company also addressed what is likely to be a top concern: how health data is handled.

“Conversations and files across ChatGPT are encrypted by default at rest and in transit as part of our core security architecture,” OpenAI noted. “Due to the sensitive nature of health data, Health builds on this foundation with additional, layered protections — including purpose-built encryption and isolation—to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized. Conversations in Health are not used to train our foundation models.”

Users can also add an additional layer of security by enabling multi-factor authentication.

OpenAI has opened a waitlist for ChatGPT Health and is starting with a small group of early users to refine the experience before expanding access more broadly in the coming weeks.

From a wider perspective, the launch comes as AI is quickly becoming unavoidable across the fitness industry.

As project definition advanced and market conditions improved, the mandate was increased to up to US$1 billion in November 2025 (see November 19, 2025 press release).","January 8, 2026, Montreal, Quebec – Troilus Mining Corp. (TSX: TLG; OTCQX: CHXMF; FRA: CM5) (“Troilus” or the “Company”), is pleased to provide a review of its key accomplishments in 2025 and an outlook for 2026, as the Company advances its flagship Troilus copper-gold project (the “Project”) through critical development milestones and positions it for the next phase of execution, in this open letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer, Justin Reid.

To our valued shareholders and stakeholders,

As we reflect on 2025, it is clear that the Troilus Team achieved major technical, regulatory, organizational, and financing milestones required to advance the Project into its next phase of development, while substantially increasing shareholder value, with the Company’s share price increasing by approximately 432% over the year. This progress has established a strong foundation as we enter 2026—a transition year focused on advancing detailed engineering, permitting and financing in preparation for construction.

Throughout the year, we advanced across all critical development streams in parallel. We completed basic engineering and transitioned into detailed engineering, submitted our Environmental and Social Impact Assessment at both the federal and provincial levels, and further improved geological confidence of mineral resources through targeted drilling. At the same time, we strengthened the organization with key additions to our leadership and operational teams and continued to modernize internal systems to support the transition from project development to execution.

Outstanding market performance over the year reflected the impact of this operational delivery and continued investor confidence in the quality and scale of the Troilus Project. Importantly, this performance was underpinned by tangible progress on the ground and increasing project readiness, rather than macro conditions alone.

We were pleased to see Troilus continue to be recognized as a project of strategic importance within the broader critical minerals ecosystem. Our inclusion as a corporate delegate on the Canadian government’s critical-minerals trade missions to Germany and to Japan and South Korea reflect growing global interest in the Project and its alignment with secure, long-term supply-chain priorities.

Separately, in recognition of the breadth of progress and execution achieved across all aspects of the Project throughout the year, we were honoured to receive the Québec Mineral Exploration Association’s Entrepreneur of the Year award in late October (see October 30,2025 press release).

With the key gating items of the development pathway now well advanced, Troilus enters 2026 focused on disciplined execution. The coming year is expected to mark a transition from planning to early construction readiness, as we continue to advance and de-risk the Project.

2025 Key Accomplishments:

Technical and Project De-Risking

Technical progress remained the primary focus throughout 2025. During the year, Troilus maintained schedule discipline, completing basic engineering and transitioning into detailed engineering under the direction of BBA Inc (see January 28, June 10, and October 15, 2025 press releases). Major engineering deliverables – including process flowsheet definition, capital cost estimation, procurement planning, and project execution planning – were substantially advanced, with all key requests for quotations issued and technical and commercial evaluations of major equipment and construction packages well progressed. This work materially strengthens project definition and supports construction readiness by underpinning permitting, financing, and advanced exploration.

In parallel, Troilus submitted its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) to both federal and provincial authorities, marking one of the most significant gating items for the Project (see June 25, 2025 press release). The submission met internal targets, and the review process is well advanced, with federal approval currently targeted for the second half of 2026 and provincial approval to follow. Ongoing engagement with regulators, stakeholders and Indigenous rightsholders continue as part of this process.

The Company also completed approximately 13,300 metres of drilling during the year, most of which focused on delineating and extending high-grade trends to further improve geological confidence, upgrading resources to indicated and measured categories (see February 4, May 22, June 17, 2025 press releases).

Building a Construction-Ready Organization

With key technical milestones achieved, Troilus continued to build the organizational capacity required for the next phase of development.

Throughout 2025, the Company made several targeted senior appointments across Project leadership, construction, processing, health and safety, and operational readiness, aligning the organization with the evolving needs of the Project as it advances toward execution. Several new members of the operational team have committed to a Chibougamau-based presence, further supporting local integration and readiness.

Health and safety remained a core priority. Troilus achieved zero lost-time incidents during calendar 2025 and made meaningful progress in implementing a modern health and safety framework aligned with best practices within the Québec mining sector. Enhanced data collection, proactive risk analysis, and preventative systems have been put in place, supported by the recent addition of a dedicated Health and Safety Superintendent. These efforts will continue in 2026 to ensure that health and safety are a top priority at the Troilus site as we prepare for increased activity and an influx of new workers.

Internally, Troilus also advanced work to modernize and strengthen its operating systems and corporate infrastructure. Preparatory work was undertaken to support the implementation of upgraded enterprise and operational systems in 2026, ensuring scalability, transparency, and operational discipline as the Company transitions toward construction and operations.

Financing and Commercial Progress

Advancing a generational copper-gold operation producing more than 300,000 gold-equivalent ounces per year requires a comprehensive and resilient financing strategy. Following the release of the Troilus Project Feasibility Study in May 2024 (see May 14, 2024 press release), the Company made it a priority to establish a funding framework capable of supporting construction while maintaining flexibility through development.

By late 2024, Troilus had secured indicative expressions of interest (“LOIs”) totaling approximately US$1.3 billion from a group of leading global export credit agencies (“ECAs”), providing the foundation for a structured project financing process (see November 13, November 19 and November 21, 2024 press releases).

In March 2025, Troilus mandated a syndicate of global financial institutions, led by Société Générale, KfW IPEX-Bank, and Export Development Canada, to arrange a senior project debt facility of up to US$700 million (see March 13, 2025 press release). As project definition advanced and market conditions improved, the mandate was increased to up to US$1 billion in November 2025 (see November 19, 2025 press release). Comprehensive technical, financial, and environmental and social due diligence has been underway since early 2025 and will continue in 2026 to underpin the finalization of the debt package.

Commercial arrangements progressed in parallel and are integrated into the debt financing framework. During 2025, Troilus negotiated preliminary indicative long-term offtake terms with Aurubis AG and Boliden Commercial AB, two of Europe’s leading copper smelters, covering a significant portion of the Project’s anticipated copper-gold concentrate production and reflecting strong demand for high-quality, responsibly sourced copper (see June 18, July 10, and August 26, 2025 press releases). In parallel, discussions with potential Canadian smelters are ongoing, with the expectation that a portion of future concentrate production will be processed domestically to support local supply chains. These arrangements are expected to be finalized in 2026.

In November 2025, the Company strengthened its balance sheet through a CDN$172.5 million bought-deal public offering, representing the second-largest common share offering by a Québec-headquartered company in over a decade and the second-largest TSX issuer financing completed in 2025 (see November 14, 2025 press release). The financing further expanded Troilus’ institutional shareholder base, including the participation of new major global funds.

Looking ahead, the senior debt facility is expected to form the cornerstone of a fully funded construction package, complemented by additional financing instruments under evaluation, with the objective of delivering a balanced and flexible financing solution in 2026.

A 2022 S&P report pegged copper demand even higher, reaching above 50 million tons annually by 2040, but that was based on a “net zero” scenario in which renewable energy and EV use expand faster than they currently are.
And it’s clear that an integrated global market is necessary for sufficient copper to get to where it is most needed.
Saudi Arabia is also rapidly building out its copper refining capacity.
So for copper, the only path forward is through trade.","Copper is a conflict mineral of the future, an indispensable building block for critical technologies that has long been taken for granted but that will play an increasingly central role in US trade relations with China and Latin America—where most of the world’s copper production and processing capacity are located. The S&P study stresses that copper can’t be obtained at the necessary volumes or timelines through recycling or new mining alone. A 2022 S&P report pegged copper demand even higher, reaching above 50 million tons annually by 2040, but that was based on a “net zero” scenario in which renewable energy and EV use expand faster than they currently are. Even under the current pace of adoption, copper demand will still likely grow at least 1 million tons per year up to 2040, the new report found. Filling that need is a diplomatic challenge at least as much as an engineering one, with critical steps of the supply chain spread around the globe.

US President Donald Trump’s recent escalation in saber-rattling toward mineral-rich Greenland — whose deposits of copper are likely significant but remain underexplored — shows the administration’s willingness to exercise force to expand US access to raw materials. But taking minerals by force may close off access to other pieces of the supply puzzle by further ratcheting up protectionism on the part of other powers.

And it’s clear that an integrated global market is necessary for sufficient copper to get to where it is most needed. The US urgently needs to catch up to China on copper processing capability, which invading Greenland won’t help address: The US has only two functioning smelters, while China has dozens (which help to keep their costs low through the use of cheap renewable electricity, as well as plentiful supplies of heavily polluting coal). Saudi Arabia is also rapidly building out its copper refining capacity.

So for copper, the only path forward is through trade. “If we think it will be solved for the US by investment in the US, we’re never going to get there,” said Carlos Pascual, S&P Global’s senior vice president for geopolitics and international affairs.","https://img.semafor.com/4b0b93be598680a19e42ba37a19e4e0e87b97019-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2026-01-08 13:14:43.479391

Tezos, a self-amending blockchain platform, is gaining attention for its potential price trajectory through 2030, driven by its technological advancements and market positioning. Since its 2018 launch, Tezos has been recognized for its proof-of-stake consensus, on-chain governance, and formal verification capabilities, which allow protocol upgrades without hard forks. In 2024, Tezos processed over 50 million transactions, maintaining energy efficiency significantly higher than proof-of-work networks. The platform's total value locked in decentralized applications reached $150 million by late 2024, marking a 300% year-over-year growth. Institutional adoption is also on the rise, with entities like Société Générale utilizing Tezos for digital asset securities. Analysts predict that upcoming platform upgrades, such as enhanced Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, could further boost developer accessibility and price appreciation. Additionally, regulatory clarity and the growing tokenization of real-world assets are expected to support Tezos's market expansion. Long-term projections for Tezos through 2030 consider its established presence in digital art, gaming, and regulated finance. As enterprise blockchain adoption becomes mainstream, Tezos's unique governance model and energy efficiency may offer competitive advantages. However, the platform faces challenges from intense competition and macroeconomic factors, which could impact its valuation. Investors are advised to monitor network activity, developer growth, and partnerships to assess Tezos's potential for significant market expansion.

Ventyx’s pipeline features small molecule therapeutics, including NLRP3 inhibitors, designed to target inflammation across a spectrum of diseases with high unmet medical needs. These include cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company’s clinical-stage programs aim to deliver improved efficacy and safety compared to existing treatments.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific and product officer at Lilly. “Ventyx’s pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options and strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients across cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity.”

The acquisition terms include a purchase price of $14.00 per share, representing a 62% premium to Ventyx’s 30-day volume-weighted average trading price as of January 5, 2026. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and is subject to regulatory approvals and Ventyx stockholder consent. Entities affiliated with New Science Ventures and Ventyx’s directors and officers (representing approximately 10% of the company’s outstanding shares) have already signed voting and support agreements.

Raju Mohan, CEO of Ventyx, echoed Skovronsky’s sentiment through highlighting the potential of their NLRP3 inhibitors to address residual and chronic inflammation, which is now recognized as a major risk factor in neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. “Lilly’s resources and commitment to innovative oral drugs make them an ideal partner to advance our therapies and address vast unmet needs,” he said.

This acquisition builds on Lilly’s presence in inflammatory-mediated diseases. In January 2020, the firm shelled out $1.1 billion to purchase Dermira. The acquisition added lebrikizumab lebrikizumab, an IL-13 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, to Lilly's portfolio. It also included Qbrexza, a treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating).

“American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods — protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains — and dramatically reduce highly processed foods.
Whole grains The previous Dietary Guidelines recommended three servings of whole grains and three servings of refined grains daily.
The website placed much of the blame on processed foods.
“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to Americans: Dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet,” said Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association.","WASHINGTON — The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025-2030 released Jan. 7 upended several recommendations from a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) and flipped the old food pyramid upside down.

Unlike the previous pyramid, which was replaced by MyPlate over a decade ago, the new pyramid places the food that should be consumed the most at its flat top: nutrient-dense protein from animal and plant sources; healthy fats from whole foods such as eggs, seafood, meats, full-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, olives and avocados; and vegetables and fruit.

The new pyramid has whole grains at the pointy bottom, promoting two to four servings a day, and it leaves out refined grains entirely. In the old pyramid, bread, cereal, rice and pasta were at the bottom base, with recommendations of 6 to 11 servings per day.

“These Guidelines return us to the basics,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods — protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains — and dramatically reduce highly processed foods. This is how we make America healthy again.”

The HHS and the US Department of Agriculture update the Dietary Guidelines every five years.

Whole grains

The previous Dietary Guidelines recommended three servings of whole grains and three servings of refined grains daily. The new Dietary Guidelines recommend that consumers should prioritize fiber-rich whole grains and reduce consumption of highly processed carbohydrates.

“The updated Guidelines place an emphasis on whole grains, which aligns with long-standing public health goals,” said Erin Ball, executive director of the Grain Foods Foundation. “However, the Guidelines de-emphasize grains overall, and the guidance does not recommend refined and enriched grain foods — thus ignoring their role in nutrient delivery, affordability and how baked goods function in everyday eating patterns.”

Fifty percent of Americans have prediabetes or diabetes, 75% of adults report having at least one chronic disease, and 90% of US health care spending goes to treating chronic disease, according to realfood.gov. The website placed much of the blame on processed foods.

“For the first time, we’re calling out the dangers of highly processed foods and rebuilding a broken system from the ground up with gold-standard science and common sense,” the website said.

Going against the DGAC

Normally, the Dietary Guidelines take the findings of the DGAC into account. This time the administration of President Donald Trump did a supplemental scientific analysis of the 2025 DGAC report, which was finished during the Biden administration. The analysis found that the DGAC advocated plant-based dietary patterns, deprioritized animal-sourced proteins and favored high-linoleic acid vegetable oils.

The new Dietary Guidelines do not implement several DGAC recommendations, including emphasizing the intake of beans, peas and lentils while reducing intakes of red and processed meats, and emphasizing consumption of low-fat or non-fat dairy and unsaturated fats.

“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to Americans: Dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet,” said Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “IDFA applauds HHS and USDA for grounding the 2025–2030 DGA in today’s nutrition science, including the evidence showing that dairy products at all fat levels support healthy eating patterns.”

The new Dietary Guidelines will “partially” implement the DGAC report’s recommendation to limit foods and beverages higher in saturated fat and to limit total saturated fat intake to less than 10% of calories per day, starting at age 2, by replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acid.

The new Dietary Guidelines also implement several other DGAC recommendations, including limiting foods high in added sugars and emphasizing intakes of iron, folate/folic acid, iodine and chlorine among pregnant and postpartum individuals. The new pyramid encourages avoiding added sugars entirely, especially for children, while allowing naturally occurring sugars found in whole fruits and plain dairy.

“The administration pledged the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans would deliver fresh, simple, comprehensive, science-based guidance,” said Courtney Gaine, PhD, president and CEO of The Sugar Association. “Instead, the 500 pages of new materials released today reflect outdated rhetoric about added sugars that are anything but simple and are inconsistent, unrealistic and lacking scientific support. These Guidelines and accompanying rhetoric will not make Americans any healthier. In fact, added sugars intake has already plummeted 30% over the past two decades, while obesity has spiked by 40%.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2026/01/08/1767889620885-ebb4cf97-5482-4f25-b1f7-c58e13b939f4_1.jpg?height=635&t=1767889960&width=1200,N,,2026-01-08 15:02:25.901201

In October, Ventyx reported preliminary data from a Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk and obesity.
This study included a cohort that evaluated the study drug alongside Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 weight loss drug, Wegovy.
Beyond NLRP3, Ventyx has compounds in mid-stage clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease: the S1P1R modulator tamuzimod and the TYK2 inhibitor VTX958.
Novo’s pipeline lists an NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 1 development for the fatty liver disease MASH and cardiovascular disease.","Eli Lilly is building its prospects in immunology through the $1.2 billion acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences, a clinical-stage company with drugs addressing a promising target offering the potential to treat a range of inflammatory disorders.

The deal announced after Wednesday’s market close follows Ventyx’s fall release of mid-stage data for lead program VTX3232, a drug in development for treating inflammation that contributes to cardiovascular disease. That data readout triggered discussions with Sanofi, whose prior investment in Ventyx gave it the right of first negotiation on the program. But Lilly won out with a deal to buy the entire company.

Ventyx develops oral small molecule drugs for inflammatory disorders. In recent years, the San Diego-based biotech honed its R&D focus to drugs that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex that regulates inflammatory signaling. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that target NLRP3.

In October, Ventyx reported preliminary data from a Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk and obesity. The readout showed treatment with VTX3232 reduced levels of a liver protein associated with inflammation along with reductions in a range of biological measures indicative of cardiovascular risk. The drug was safe and well tolerated. But VTX3232 does not appear to have a future as an obesity drug. This study included a cohort that evaluated the study drug alongside Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 weight loss drug, Wegovy. Results showed VTX3232 did not lead to weight loss as a monotherapy or in addition to Wegovy.

The cardiovascular results followed the summer release of encouraging data from a separate Phase 2 test of VTX3232 in Parkinson’s disease. In this indication, Ventyx is leveraging the brain-penetrating properties of the molecule as a way to treat the neurodegenerative disorder.

The Ventyx pipeline also includes VTX2735, a peripherally restricted NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 2 testing for recurrent pericarditis. Beyond NLRP3, Ventyx has compounds in mid-stage clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease: the S1P1R modulator tamuzimod and the TYK2 inhibitor VTX958. Lilly sees broad potential applications for Ventyx’s drugs.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific and product officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said in a prepared statement. “Ventyx’s clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.”

Lilly’s main metabolic medicines rival, Novo Nordisk, has an NLRP3 inhibitor licensed from startup Ventus Therapeutics. Novo’s pipeline lists an NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 1 development for the fatty liver disease MASH and cardiovascular disease. Roche also has a clinical-stage NLRP3 inhibitors in its pipeline. Other companies with NLRP3 inhibitors include BioAge Labs and startup Nodthera.

The financial terms of the acquisition agreement call for Lilly to pay $14 in cash for each share of Ventyx, an approximately 62% premium to the stock’s average trading price in the 30 days leading up to Jan. 5. Shares of Ventyx spiked earlier this week after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Lilly was close to striking a deal for the biotech.

The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction, which still requires approvals from Ventyx stockholders and regulators. Lilly expects to close the acquisition in the first half of this year.

(ACI) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 5.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.

We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.

Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.

So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefiting from the inevitable rebound.

However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.

Here's Why ACI Could Experience a Turnaround

The heavy selling of ACI shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 24.44. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.

The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ACI has increased 0.5%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.

Moreover, ACI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .

Parabilis’ financing is the largest disclosed in early January.
The result was what is now the Helicon platform, which Parabilis says it can use to reach multiple critical targets previously considered undruggable.","Dive Brief:

Parabilis Medicines, formerly known as FogPharma, raised $305 million in a Series F financing to support its mission of pursuing disease targets long dismissed as out of reach by modern science.

RA Capital Management, Fidelity Management and Janus Henderson Investors led the latest round of financing, which included both old and new investors, Parabilis said Thursday. The Series F gave the company a higher valuation than the previous round, which pulled in $145 million in early 2024.

The company plans to use the funds to advance its lead drug candidate, zolucatetide, which is designed to target a beta-catenin pathway connected to millions of cancer cases. The experimental therapy has shown “compelling preliminary data” in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, Parabilis said.

Dive Insight:

Parabilis is riding a wave of resurgent enthusiasm for venture capital funding in the industry. A downturn after the pandemic dramatically slowed the pace of new public offerings and left private companies struggling for cash. Trump administration policies that gutted scientific funding, introduced turmoil into regulatory agencies and threatened tariffs on the industry made the situation worse.

But the second half of 2025 saw a turnaround for biopharma. Venture capital funding rebounded as concerns about tariffs lessened, key drug launches beat expectations and a flurry of acquisitions demonstrated faith in smaller biotechs. IPOs may be poised to bounce back as well, with Aktis Oncology set to be the first to test the waters this year.

The funding round announced by Parabilis comes amid similar recent announcements from Soley Therapeutics, Diagonal Therapeutics, EpiBiologics and Beacon Therapeutics, among others. Parabilis’ financing is the largest disclosed in early January.

Parabilis has long had a high profile for a cancer medicine startup. The company’s Helicon technology is based on work done by co-founder Greg Verdine and his team in a laboratory at Harvard University starting in the late 1990s. Verdine has since become a serial biotech entrepreneur.

At Harvard, Verdine’s team set out to overcome the problem that traditional drugs have in reaching and binding to disease-causing proteins inside a cell. They developed short peptides in a specific helix shape that could enter cells and block disease targets.

Walmart appointed the former CEO of Grammarly (now Superhuman) Shishir Mehrotra to its board of directors, according to a Thursday press release.

Mehrotra will serve on the board’s technology and e-commerce committee, as well as its compensation and management development committee.

He brings over 25 years of technology experience to the appointment, including co-founding an AI platform and serving as YouTube’s chief product officer and chief technology officer.

Dive Insight:

Mehrotra’s tech background ties into Walmart’s larger efforts to adopt AI across the business.

“I have long admired Walmart’s ability to innovate while staying true to its core values, and joining the Board as the company builds for an agentic AI future is a rare opportunity,” Mehrotra said in a statement. “This era is the most significant technological shift I’ve seen in my career, and I look forward to working with the team to shape the future for the millions of people Walmart serves.”

The mass retailer announced a slew of AI-related tools and initiatives in 2025.

Walmart in July debuted a new AI framework for the entire business that centers around four “super agents” and unifies its approach to the technology, aiming to avoid fragmented innovation across the company. Since then, Walmart has expressed confidence in its customer-facing AI agent Sparky becoming more important for shoppers and also launched new tools for marketplace sellers.

The company has also inked a deal with AI powerhouse OpenAI to create custom certification trainings for employees and started selling through ChatGPT’s Instant Checkout shopping feature.

Mehrotra’s appointment comes a few weeks before Walmart veteran John Furner is set to take over the CEO position from Doug McMillon. When Furner’s appointment was announced in November, the emergence of artificial intelligence in retail was specifically mentioned by McMillon.

“He’s uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation,” McMillon said in a statement at the time. “He’s a merchant, an operator, an innovator, and a builder.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/R9RgNAwK9r8pSjQk9DFiJ9sF-QCaEOt7Ul3ooHfVo9I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XYWxtYXJ0X0dlcm1hbnRvd25fTWFyeWxhbmRfMDYwOTI1LTEuSlBH.webp,N,,2026-01-08 12:15:03.433476

The brands said a merger would allow them to better compete against growing rivals in the grocery industry, like Walmart and Costco, and would preserve customer choice.

However, the $24.6 billion deal was met with backlash as the federal government argued it would “almost certainly” benefit shareholders and not the people who visit the stores daily.

Under the deal, the two grocery chains would sell 579 locations in places where their stores overlap to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a supplier to independent supermarkets.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urged the judge in the case to temporarily prevent the merger in September 2024, as the commission previously worried the merger would lead to higher food prices for consumers and eliminate competition.

“It’s this local competition, in these local communities, that this merger will eliminate,” Susan Musser, the FTC’s chief trial counsel said, adding that Albertsons and Kroger compete with one another rather than places like Amazon or Costco where consumers partake in other kinds of shopping.

Johnson & Johnson has announced the submission of its Ottava Robotic Surgical System for De Novo classification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Ottava system encompasses surgical instrumentation and will, in future, be connected to the Polyphonic digital ecosystem. It is intended to address unmet need for surgeons.The De Novo classification request – De Novo classification is designed for new, low-to-moderate-risk medical devices – centres on an indication for Ottava that covers upper abdomen surgery, including gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

The submission is based on data from the Ottava Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, filed data used to show Ottava’s safety and effectiveness. Initial cases were completed at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Centre by Dr Erik Wilson, chief of minimally invasive and elective general surgery at University of Texas Health (UT Health) Houston and lead study investigator.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the Ottava system, and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, chief scientific officer, MedTech at Johnson & Johnson.

Additionally, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval in late 2025 for the initiation of a US clinical trial of Ottava in inguinal hernia procedures. This is one of the US’ most commonly-performed surgeries.

Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.
Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed.
Instead of treating each smart bulb as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light.
Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users.","What you need to know

Unlike old scenes that assigned colors at random, Hue SpatialAware uses an algorithm to map your room so lights work together.

You scan your room with your phone, the Hue app builds a spatial model, and an algorithm orchestrates the scene automatically.

About half of Hue’s Scene Gallery supports SpatialAware at launch, including Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.

Until now, Hue scenes looked nice, but didn’t really understand your room. Colors were assigned to lights without knowing their actual spots. For example, a lamp behind your couch might shine as brightly as a ceiling light across the room, which could ruin the effect Hue wanted. Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.

Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed. Instead of treating each smart bulb as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light. It then spreads colors and brightness in a way that copies how light works in real life.

The Hue app uses augmented reality and asks you to scan your room with your phone or tablet. This scan builds a model that shows where each light is, including floor lamps, wall lights, and ceiling fixtures. After that, an algorithm takes over and arranges scenes so every light fits in naturally.

If you add new lights later, just scan the area again and the room model updates on its own.

Nature scenes get the biggest upgrade

The most noticeable upgrade is in Hue’s nature-inspired scenes. About half of the updated Scene Gallery will work with SpatialAware at launch, including options like Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.

In practice, if you choose a sunset-style scene, lights on one side of the room glow with warm yellows, while lights across the room turn deeper and darker. You can still use the classic scene mode if you want, but after seeing SpatialAware, the difference is clear.

Philips Hue says the feature is built for Bridge Pro users, framing it as a premium experience that leans heavily on smarter processing and room awareness.

Bridge Pro is also becoming more flexible. Now, users can combine several Bridges into one Bridge Pro setup, with the only limit being the hardware’s capacity.

Hue’s AI assistant is also getting better. Now, you can ask it to create automations using natural language, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. It’s also adding more language support and learning how to guide users to the right troubleshooting help when problems come up.

Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users. Most of the other upgrades will arrive between now and the first quarter of 2026.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4y4JJNKP4ijz9rWNSc3jrC-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:48.551717

This is the conclusion of an analysis by wine market analyst Del Rey AWM based on market data from S&P Global.

In principle, the figures initially show that French wine exports were in decline during the first nine months of 2025. Between January and September, exports decreased by 2.5% in value and 1.8% in volume, while average prices fell slightly to €8.71 per liter (-0.7%). In absolute figures, this means an export of 9.4m hectoliters of wine worth €8.2bn for this period.

Sparkling wine prices reduced

A breakdown by category shows a mixed picture: sparkling wine exports, particularly Champagne, actually increased (+4.1%) to 148m liters. However, this growth was accompanied by a reversal of the previous year's price increases: average prices fell by 6.2% to €19.58 per liter, which led to a revenue decrease of 2.3% to €2.9bn.

For bottled still wines, prices remained relatively stable at €7.68 per liter, but exports declined in both volume (–3.2%) and value (–2.9% to just over €5bn). The bulk wine category, which is less significant for French wine exports, lost 2.1% in volume. However, prices that were 8.5% higher led to a revenue increase of 6.2% (totaling €140m).

If the value losses of French wine exports are differentiated regionally, it becomes clear that a good third of the deficit was caused by the lack of demand for Bordeaux wines: €50.3m of the total €152.9m decline in revenue for bottled still wines is attributable to Bordeaux. Languedoc also suffered a sharp drop in value of €25.9m (–22.7%). Overall, AOP wines were significantly more affected by the decline than IGP wines: €140m of the decline in turnover for non-sparkling bottled wines was caused by wines with a protected designation of origin.

A look at different markets shows that the decline in sales to Asia and North America was partially offset by increased exports to Europe, Oceania, and Africa. Of course, these could not compensate for the losses, especially in the USA and China. Deliveries to the United States from January to September 2025 fell by 10.6% in value and 3.5% in volume. However, looking at the third quarter of last year in isolation, French wine exports to the USA collapsed by 39% in value and 15.1% in volume, as average prices fell by 28.5%, which Del Rey believes was intended to offset the higher tariffs.

In China, the volume of French wine exports in the first nine months of 2025 even fell by 36%. The fact that the value only decreased by 23.8% is—unlike the situation in the USA—thanks to a price increase of 19%. The export losses are not due to the customs situation, but to the structural decline in wine consumption in China—whereby the French premiumization strategy prevented worse.

As different as the respective problems are, according to Del Rey, in view of some of the main competitors such as Australia and Italy, ""France suffered the largest decline among major suppliers."" Incidentally, exports to South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Luxembourg (–€48.5m alone) also fell. Better sales were achieved in Australia and New Zealand, but also in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. As an outlook, Del Rey summarized: "" For all producers, market diversification, product innovation, and a stronger focus on premium wines as well as fresher and new wine-based beverages appear essential to navigating this increasingly complex environment.” SP",https://www.meininger.de/sites/meininger.de/files/fields/field_a_artikelbild/web_Frankreich-Exporte_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:05:14.699130

The San Diego-based company has made no secret of the fact that it was hoping to find additional pharma backing. Sanofi had already secured the right to first negotiation for Ventyx’s Parkinson’s and cardiovascular disease candidate VTX3232 as part of a $27 million investment the French pharma made in the biotech in 2024.

A first readout from a phase 2 study of VTX3232 last June tied the NLRP3 inhibitor to drops in biomarkers of NLRP3 inhibition as well as improvements in Parkinson’s motor and non-motor symptoms.

At the time, Ventyx CEO Raju Mohan, Ph.D., acknowledged that Sanofi’s right of first negotiation wouldn’t formally start until the second VTX3232 readout. But the CEO gave a strong hint that the company didn’t want to wait that long to secure a Big Pharma partner.

“Sanofi is not restricted to waiting until the second readout,"" Mohan said at a Jefferies event in June 2025. “They or anybody else can act any time. We can't solicit other folks as part of [the right of first negotiation], but somebody can say, ‘Hey, look, we love your data.’”

It sounds like Lilly did just that. The U.S. pharma announced Wednesday that it was paying $14 per share of Ventyx—more than double the $7.50 the stock closed out at Monday. The price tag values Ventyx at around $1.2 billion, Lilly explained in a Jan. 7 release.

VTX3232 doesn’t only have potential for Parkinson’s patients. In October, Ventyx read out data from a separate phase 2 study demonstrating that the drug cut levels of a biomarker for stroke and other serious risks by almost 80% within a week. That trial looked at VTX3232 as a monotherapy as well as an add-on to Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss drug semaglutide.

Beyond VTX3232, Ventyx has another NLRP3 inhibitor, dubbed VTX2735, in phase 2 studies for a type of heart inflammation called recurrent pericarditis. There are also two inflammatory bowel disease drugs in phase 2 development—an S1P1R modulator called tamuzimod and a TYK2 inhibitor called VTX958.

Mohan described Lilly as an “ideal strategic partner,” pointing to the pharma’s “unparalleled resources, a passion for innovative oral drugs and a commitment to advance novel therapies.”

“Our portfolio of class-leading NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognized as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases,” Mohan added.

Explaining the rationale behind the deal, Lilly Chief Scientific and Product Officer Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., alluded to “increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases.”

“Ventyx's clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity,” Skovronsky added.

William Blair analysts said yesterday’s deal “demonstrates clear interest from Big Pharma in the NLRP3 inhibitor class to address a broad range of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic, and cardiovascular diseases.”

In a Jan. 8 note, the analysts pointed out that other biopharmas are working in the NLRP3 space, name-checking the likes of Novartis, Neumora, Neurocrine Biosciences, BioAge, NodThera and Monte Rosa Therapeutics.

“NLRP3 in the [central nervous system] also represents an intriguing target for obesity and several preclinical studies across NLRP3 inhibitors suggest obesity efficacy in diet-induced-obesity models,” the analysts added. “However, not all NLRP3 inhibitors are CNS-penetrant.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/M%26A24.jpg?VersionId=C.FsKt7NUy1obRC7ODrMf.NqCjMX0jfl,N,,2026-01-08 11:04:37.687177

You see, instead of randomly assigning colours to bulbs, SpatialAware uses your phone’s camera to scan the room and map each light’s position. The system then applies colours in a way that mirrors real-world effects, such as a sunset glowing warmly on one side of the room while the opposite side fades into darker tones.

Smarter scenes, smoother moods

Lighting scenes have always been a highlight of the Hue app, offering quick ways to set a mood or transform a space. The problem was that colours often felt scattered, with no sense of flow between bulbs. That mismatch could break the illusion, leaving rooms looking more chaotic than calming.

SpatialAware fixes this by tailoring palettes to the actual layout of your lights, creating a sense of harmony across the room.

The difference is striking: instead of random splashes of colour, you get gradients that feel intentional and immersive.

Nature‑inspired scenes such as “Savannah Sunset” or “Lake Mist” show off the feature best, with ceiling lights glowing like open skies while floor lamps settle into deeper tones that ground the space. The result is a more cohesive atmosphere that feels closer to how light behaves in the real world, making everyday moments at home more inviting.

Bridge Pro gets its moment

SpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro, which launched last year. The latest update allows users to consolidate multiple bridges into one, supporting up to 150 lights and 50 accessories. That’s a big win for households already juggling several hubs.

AI assistant and Apple Home integration

Philips Hue’s AI assistant is also stepping up. It now creates automations based on natural requests, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. Language support continues to expand beyond English to include Dutch, German, and Spanish.

Meanwhile, Apple Home users will soon enjoy seamless integration with Hue Secure cameras, video doorbells, and sensors.

On the other hand, features like live streaming in picture-in-picture on Apple TV and real-time alerts in the Apple Home app are on the way.",https://www.the-ambient.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/philips-hue-omniglow-strip-light.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:04:00.175365

The shopping season, which spans November 1 through December 31, saw 25 days when spending hit $4 billion, besting 2024’s 18 days. Use of buy now, pay later methods also peaked this year, up 9.8% to $20 billion, posting the largest-ever spend day on Cyber Monday.

Online Cyber Week spend rose 7.7% YoY to $44.2 billion online. While Cyber Monday proved to be the biggest e-commerce day of the year, bringing in $14.25 billion in spend (up 7.1%), Black Friday’s growth actually outpaced Cyber Monday, with online spend jumping 9.1% to $11.8 billion.

Electronics were the top category, up 8.2% YoY to $59.8 billion, followed by apparel and furniture. Cosmetics got a 9.3% bump to $8.4 billion, while grocery spend increased 10.2% to $23.7 billion. Top sellers included video games, refrigerators and freezers, washers and dryers, and headphones and speakers.

Consumers shopped on their phones even more this season, with smartphone transactions accounting for 56.4% of online spend, compared to 54.5% in 2024. Mobile shopping peaked on Christmas Day, followed by Thanksgiving.

Discounts were, of course, a draw for consumers, particularly within electronics (the top discounts reached ~31% off), toys, apparel, TVs, computers, sporting goods, appliances, and furniture. Many consumers opted to use the season to purchase higher-ticket items, with units sold rising 20% versus the rest of the year, with the top category—electronics—up 56%.

Adobe also found that generative AI traffic to retail sites jumped 693.4% during the holiday season, though it noted the number of consumers using these tools was “modest.”

We can all benefit by staying focused on how these and other key trends unfold.","Welcome to 2026. Drug store and grocery retailers will have major opportunities to make progress on strategies in areas such as artificial intelligence, pricing, pharmacy and loyalty.

Some emerging retail trends, especially in technology, will become mainstream. Other trends will represent unique, strategic opportunities.

Here are five key trends to watch.

1. Price/Value Messaging will be 24/7

After a holiday in which price and savings took center stage in retail messaging, from Walgreens to Target, companies will need to figure out how to incorporate this in an ongoing way. Price and value strategies will be crucial because approaching year-end Consumer Confidence remained weak and many shoppers were pulling back on discretionary spending and focusing more on price-value optimization, according to the 2026 Food and Beverage retail sector outlook published in early December by Circana, a Chicago-based market research firm.

2. AI Will Drive Customer and Employee Engagement

AI is quickly moving from promise to reality at retail. It is supporting shopper journeys in ways that guarantee it will become more ubiquitous this year and beyond. Walmart introduced new AI-powered tools for holiday 2025 geared to helping customers find deals, locate products and shop efficiently in-store and online. Kroger, meanwhile, enhanced its Instacart relationship by making available to customers Instacart’s AI assistant called Cart Assistant, for those shopping on the Kroger iOS mobile app.

3. Loyalty Rewards to Push Envelope

Retailers are ratcheting up strategies to reward their most loyal shoppers, by offering exclusive opportunities and launching contests, for example. Albertsons recently became the first major grocer to offer Uber One perks to free and paid loyalty members through extended free trials. Aldi, meanwhile, unveiled a contest to celebrate its most loyal fans by asking for feedback on why they should be considered a “Super Fan?” An exclusive group of 25 winners are offered a year’s worth of free groceries, an invitation to a members-only event and Aldi merch. As shoppers feel more love from retailers, they will likely want more TLC in 2026.

4. Pharmacy Embracing the Long View

Pharmacies are taking proactive approaches to bolster their futures by enhancing relevancy to customers and society. CVS Health has been conducting extensive research on how to advance community pharmacy. The retailer released 2025 Rx Report: Community Pharmacy Reimagined, which explores how community pharmacies are adapting to meet needs amid a changing landscape. In another example, Walgreens has conducted what it calls the longest commitment to clinical research for a U.S. retail pharmacy, citing three years of leading a community-based research effort to improve patient access.

5. Store Development to Pursue Unique Approaches

In some years store development trends have been relatively uniform across retail. That has been anything but the case lately. Retailers are taking highly individual approaches, a dynamic likely to continue. Last year Target opened the latest of its larger-format units, a nearly 150,000-square-foot location in South Riding, Va. Contrast that with a recent strategy from Whole Foods Market, which has been opening locations of its smaller-format store concept, called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, with footprints of only a few thousand square feet each.

Why are these trends important? In my annual outlook piece a year ago, I mentioned it’s easy for retailers to get so involved in day-to-day activities that they miss key changes in the most important business developments. That point is truer than ever. We can all benefit by staying focused on how these and other key trends unfold.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/assetbank_2583282911.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:06.948313

Kennedy Jr. and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. This historic reset—described by Kennedy as the most significant overhaul in decades—places real food, protein, and healthy fats squarely at the center of U.S. nutrition policy, while calling for a dramatic reduction in highly processed foods.

At a White House press conference, Kennedy declared, “These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and make America healthier again.” Flanked by Rollins and other health officials, he introduced an updated food pyramid that visually prioritizes vegetables, proteins like red meat and eggs, cheese, and healthy fats such as olive oil and butter, with whole grains now forming the base of the pyramid. The visual overhaul is more than symbolic: it reflects a fundamental shift in federal thinking about what constitutes a healthy diet.

The new guidelines, updated every five years, are the backbone of federal food policy. They influence what’s served in school cafeterias, on military bases, and in food aid programs for mothers and infants. According to NPR, Kennedy and Rollins wrote that more than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, attributing this crisis to a national diet “reliant on highly processed foods and coupled with a sedentary lifestyle.”

For the first time, the government is formally recommending that Americans cut down on ultra-processed foods. The guidelines explicitly warn against “packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet,” as well as sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, fruit drinks, and energy drinks. Parents are advised to avoid all added sugars and artificial sweeteners for children under four years old, and the guidelines recommend no amount of added sugar for children under ten. “No amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is part of a healthy diet,” the guidelines state, a stance that has drawn both praise and criticism from industry groups.

The new recommendations also call for Americans to “limit alcoholic beverages,” a departure from previous guidelines that specified daily limits for men and women. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, commented at the press conference, “There was never good data to support the previously recommended level of alcohol consumption.” He added, “In the best-case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize.”

One of the most controversial aspects of the new guidelines is the administration’s stance on saturated fats. Kennedy proclaimed, “We are ending the war on saturated fats,” arguing that protein and healthy fats “were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.” The document encourages Americans to prioritize oils with essential fatty acids like olive oil, but also includes butter and beef tallow as acceptable options. Still, the guidelines maintain the long-held recommendation that saturated fat should not exceed 10% of daily calories—a point of contention for some nutrition experts.

“I'm very disappointed in the new pyramid that features red meat and saturated fat sources at the very top, as if that's something to prioritize. It does go against decades and decades of evidence and research,” said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University and a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, as reported by NPR. Both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics point to evidence linking excess saturated fat to heart disease. The AHA, while welcoming the new emphasis on fruits and vegetables and the call to limit highly processed foods and added sugars, continues to encourage Americans to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood, and lean meats, and to limit high-fat animal products such as red meat, butter, lard, and tallow.

Despite the criticism, some experts see merit in the new approach. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University, told NPR, “Both low-fat and whole-fat dairy versions of milk, cheese, and yogurt have been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. What's quite interesting is that the fat content doesn't seem to make a big difference.” He also praised the guidelines’ focus on reducing highly processed foods, saying, “Highly processed foods are clearly harmful for a range of diseases, so to have the U.S. government recommend that a wide class of foods be eaten less because of their processing is a big deal and I think a very positive move for public health.”

The guidelines emphasize a diet rich in “high-quality, nutrient-dense” proteins at every meal. These include red meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and, for those who prefer plant-based options, beans, peas, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy. According to the official HHS press release, the guidelines are intended to “improve Americans’ health by focusing on nutrition policy reform.”

Reactions from the food and beverage industry have been mixed. The Consumer Brands Association, representing major food companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, expressed a willingness to work with the administration while noting that consumers still “seek a diverse selection of foods.” The American Beverage Association, however, criticized the recommendations to limit both added sugar and other sweeteners. “Americans deserve pragmatic advice they can use in daily life. Guidance that discourages sugar but dismisses safe, effective no sugar options is impractical and inherently contradictory,” spokesperson William Dermody said in a statement to Axios.

Meanwhile, advocacy groups and influencers aligned with Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda have welcomed the changes. Vani Hari, known as the “Food Babe,” called the new guidelines “a dream come true,” telling Axios, “We put our full support in for Secretary Kennedy because he told the truth for the first time about the American food system ... and he is following through with his promise.”

It’s worth noting that while the guidelines have shifted to embrace more protein and healthy fats, they continue to recommend moderation and balance—echoing a longstanding body of nutritional science. A 2024 panel of nutrition experts advised HHS and USDA to encourage Americans to eat less saturated fat and meat, and to be cautious about ultra-processed foods. The new guidelines blend these expert recommendations with Kennedy’s own priorities, resulting in a policy that is both a break from and a continuation of past approaches.

As the updated guidelines begin to shape federal food programs, school lunches, and the choices Americans make at the dinner table, the nation is set for a new chapter in its ongoing debate over nutrition. Whether these changes will lead to measurable improvements in public health remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the conversation around what Americans eat has never been more front and center.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/aItl4xdZlb1wN4r52NxdJ_arVEI=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2Fda7f0ab9-d494-4c8f-b861-44803ef70a8d.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 14:02:18.193509

Aer Lingus currently serves 12 destinations in the U.S. A4A says the cap threatens to trigger the withdrawal of historic airport slots held by U.S. carriers at DUB, reducing or eliminating transatlantic services.
JetBlue, which launched its first flights to DUB in 2024, was previously denied requests to expand service because of capacity constraints tied to the passenger cap, according to the filing.
The group says this would violate provisions of the U.S.-EU agreement that guarantee airlines a “fair and equal opportunity to compete” and prohibit unilateral restrictions on traffic volumes.
The complaint asks the DOT to call a special meeting under the U.S.-EU air services agreement and to issue a show-cause order unless Ireland introduces emergency legislation to suspend or remove the cap by early February.","U.S. airlines have formally asked the U.S. Transportation Department (DOT) to intervene in a long-running dispute over passenger limits at Dublin Airport (DUB), arguing that the continued enforcement of a cap could restrict transatlantic service.

In a complaint filed Jan. 5, trade group Airlines for America (A4A) accused Ireland and the European Union of violating the U.S.-EU Air Transport Agreement and U.S. law by maintaining a local planning condition that caps passenger volumes at Dublin Airport at 32 million annually—a limit first imposed in 2007 tied to the construction of Terminal 2.

The filing, submitted under the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act, asks the DOT to take expedited action, including potentially curtailing Irish airlines’ access to the U.S. market if Ireland does not move to lift or suspend the cap. Aer Lingus currently serves 12 destinations in the U.S.

A4A says the cap threatens to trigger the withdrawal of historic airport slots held by U.S. carriers at DUB, reducing or eliminating transatlantic services. The group adds only an ongoing legal stay granted by Ireland’s High Court has so far prevented slot losses after airlines successfully challenged regulatory attempts to enforce seasonal limits tied to the cap.

Among the airlines cited in the complaint are Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways, which A4A says will be disproportionately affected if historic slots were withdrawn. JetBlue, which launched its first flights to DUB in 2024, was previously denied requests to expand service because of capacity constraints tied to the passenger cap, according to the filing.

The complaint outlines parallel legal proceedings in Ireland and at the Court of Justice of the European Union, where questions have been referred about whether the passenger cap complies with EU slot allocation rules. An advisory opinion from the court’s advocate general is due Feb. 12, with a final ruling expected later in 2026.

A4A argues that the EU court process does not address U.S. treaty rights and warns that an adverse ruling could allow Ireland to impose unilateral limits on air service. The group says this would violate provisions of the U.S.-EU agreement that guarantee airlines a “fair and equal opportunity to compete” and prohibit unilateral restrictions on traffic volumes.

Currently, DUB is exceeding the 32 million limit, handling around 36 million passengers in 2025, owing in part to High Court stays on enforcement.

The filing also details enforcement action launched by Fingal County Council, the local planning authority, against the airport operator for exceeding the cap. Airport operator daa has previously attempted to raise the limit to 36 million passengers.

Ireland’s government has publicly committed to removing the cap and has progressed draft legislation to increase or abolish the restriction, but no bill has yet become law. A4A says delays could force service reductions as early as the winter 2026-27 season if enforcement proceeds.

The complaint asks the DOT to call a special meeting under the U.S.-EU air services agreement and to issue a show-cause order unless Ireland introduces emergency legislation to suspend or remove the cap by early February.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2026-01-08 17:03:39.950344

InvestingPro data confirms Medtronic’s financial strength, with $5.2 billion in free cash flow and liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations. Trading near its 52-week high at $100.09, Medtronic appears fairly valued according to InvestingPro’s Fair Value model and maintains a solid ""GOOD"" financial health score of 2.99.

Cardiac monitoring was highlighted as the sector most likely to see acquisition activity, with Piper Sandler noting ""there are a couple of big players without exposure here,"" while predicting that even if immediate deals don’t materialize, 2026 will experience ""strong deal flow"" for both public and private assets. With a market cap of $128.2 billion and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6, Medtronic has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 49 consecutive years. For investors tracking potential M&A moves, InvestingPro offers comprehensive Pro Research Reports on 1,400+ top stocks including Medtronic, with additional ProTips and financial metrics that provide deeper insights for smarter investment decisions.

In other recent news, Medtronic has announced significant developments across its operations. The company’s diabetes unit, MiniMed, has filed for an initial public offering with plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. This move is part of a broader strategy to separate the diabetes business through capital market transactions. In addition, a real-world analysis published in Diabetes Care highlighted the effectiveness of Medtronic’s MiniMed 780G system in maintaining glucose control, even when users missed mealtime insulin doses.

Meanwhile, William Blair has upgraded Medtronic’s stock rating from Market Perform to Outperform, citing the company’s promising product pipeline and anticipated organizational changes. This upgrade suggests potential growth as Medtronic enters 2026 with new product launches.

The new show, called Bring My Pinterest to Life, follows three influencers (Drew Michael Scott, Caroline Vazzana and TayBeepBoop*) as they work with the platforms’ users on projects using a Pinterest board for inspiration. Each 22-minute episode will include real pins and boards, which viewers can save, shop, and explore without clicking away from the show. Some of the brands that will be available to shop on the show have already been announced, including Wayfair and Eos.

While Pinterest videos were already available to watch on CTV as Pinterest+, this will be the first TV show made by the platform. Other brands have successfully made the leap into entertainment — such as Red Bull — but not many. And Pinterest faces unique challenges as a platform that hosts no original content.

But the move is not completely out of the blue. In December, Pinterest announced its acquisition of cost-per-outcome CTV ad platform TvScientific, although the deal is still under regulatory review and is not expected to be confirmed until later this year.

At the time of the purchase, a spokesperson for Pinterest commented: ‘TvScientific’s outcome-based CTV platform will be integrated directly into Pinterest’s performance products, including its automation and AI-powered advertising suite, Pinterest Performance+.’

Pinterest’s announcement described the format, with its integrated ads, as an ‘emotionally resonant, shoppable’ ‘full-funnel path’ for viewers. It mirrors other features added to Pinterest to capture the full consumer journey, such as the shoppable recipes rolled out last month and Where to Buy links for consumer packaged goods pinned on the platform.

The trailer for Bring My Pinterest to Life was uploaded to YouTube on 5 Jan, and the show itself will be streaming on Roku from 23 March. The trailer is unlisted, and at time of writing has been viewed slightly under 500 times — and three of those were by me.

Earlier this month, Media War and Peace writer Evan Shapiro predicted that this would be the year of brands converting from traditional influencer marketing to launching their own content channels. He highlighted recently-launched brand channels or production companies from Under Armour, Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal as examples of this trend coming at a time when ‘the creator economy’ is taking up more and more of people’s consumption hours and brands ‘must become creators themselves’ to compete for attention.

‘There may be influencers and creators on it, but the [brand’s channel] will become an influencer and a creator,’ he said.

This aligns with the broader analyst sentiment, as Nvidia currently holds a strong buy consensus recommendation with targets ranging from $140 to $352.

The research firm cited Nvidia’s sustained technological leadership, growing strategic partnerships, and full software stack as key reasons for its positive outlook on the stock. These strengths have helped Nvidia achieve remarkable 65.22% revenue growth over the last twelve months, cementing its position as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry.

Piper Sandler also highlighted Nvidia’s favorable valuation at approximately 24.5 times price-to-earnings ratio on a next-twelve-months basis as another factor supporting its bullish stance. While InvestingPro data shows a current P/E of 46.77, the stock’s PEG ratio of 0.78 suggests it’s trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth rate. According to InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, Nvidia appears slightly undervalued at current levels.

The firm expressed particular enthusiasm about the expected performance gains from Nvidia’s Vera Rubin rack, which is anticipated to generate revenues in the second half of 2026.

In the same research note, Piper Sandler mentioned Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) as likely to benefit most from a recovery in the analog space, and identified Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) as its top small-cap idea with multiple potential catalysts ahead.

In other recent news, Nvidia has maintained its strong position in the market with reaffirmations from major financial analysts. Stifel has reiterated its Buy rating for Nvidia, setting a price target of $250, citing a positive outlook on Nvidia’s sales in China and highlighting the potential impact of H200-based sales on earnings. Similarly, Citi has also reiterated a Buy rating, maintaining a slightly higher price target of $270. In a strategic move, Nvidia is now requiring Chinese clients to make full upfront payments for H200 AI chips, with no options for cancellations or refunds, underscoring the demand and value of these chips.

Additionally, Nvidia’s new Rubin chip has been introduced, showcasing its ability to operate at higher temperatures compared to traditional data center processors. This development could signify a shift in cooling norms within the industry. However, the announcement has led to a 5% drop in Munters shares, as the new chip challenges existing cooling technologies. These recent developments highlight Nvidia’s ongoing influence and strategic maneuvers in the tech industry.

Two of the four major trends the company highlights lean into emotional resonance and genuine experience, which suggests a shift from purely technical capabilities to deeper human storytelling.

One of the trends is termed ‘Connectioneering,’ which explains visuals that stir emotions and spark connection.

According to Adobe, audiences are increasingly drawn to work that reflects shared human experiences and conveys genuine feelings, which is something AI, at its core, cannot truly feel or originate.

This trend stresses that photographers and creatives should focus on emotional impact and human connection in their work.

Authentic cultural storytelling was also a trend termed as local flavors, which is major as it centres on authentic regional and cultural expression. Adobe reports growing demand from brands and enterprises for content that genuinely reflects local identity and experiences.

This move taps into a broader creative desire for work grounded in place, culture, and lived experience, countering generic, AI-generated imagery.

While AI remains a tool in the creative toolkit, for instance, in generating surreal visuals or new forms of expression, Adobe’s forecast suggests the true value lies in how creators use AI to support, not replace, their vision.

OpenAI is releasing ChatGPT Health, a dedicated service within the AI chatbot for health-related queries.

The new service is marketed as the secure and a ‘one stop shop’ way of asking ChatGPT personal health questions.

Users can connect their medical records and wellness apps such as Apple Health and MyFitnessPal to ChatGPT, allowing the bot access to analyse the data and output informed responses, according to OpenAI. This can include understanding test results, preparing for appointments, and advice on diet and workouts.

The AI giant added that the service is designed to “support, not replace” medical care.

According to OpenAI, more than 230m people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week. However, these are not entirely private.

Speaking in a podcast last year, CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT does not offer doctor-patient confidentiality the same way a trained human professional would. “People talk about the most personal shit in their lives to ChatGPT.”

This, he said, could lead to privacy concerns in the case of a lawsuit, because OpenAI would be legally required to produce those conversations. Plus, if left to its default settings, ChatGPT also takes user inputs and content to train its models.

OpenAI claimed that ChatGPT Health tries to mitigate these issues.

The company stated that ChatGPT Health is built with purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations “protected and compartmentalised”.

Conversations from the service are also not used to train OpenAI’s foundation models, the company said. And although ChatGPT might take data from non-Health chats, OpenAI claims that data shared to Health will not flow back out the other way.

OpenAI added that users can view or delete Health memories at any time within Health or the ‘Personalisation’ section of the service’s settings.

OpenAI said it has worked for more than two years with more than 260 physicians across the world to develop the service. The company claimed that the chatbot has been evaluated against clinical standards set by an assessment framework OpenAI has created specifically for examining health-related outputs.

Interested users outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK can sign up for the waitlist to join ChatGPT Health, which will run with a small cohort of users to refine the experience. The company plans to expand access and make the service available to users across the web and iOS in the coming weeks, it said.

With hundreds of millions using AI chatbots, information shared to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and others are not just valuable to the companies providing the services. A security firm recently uncovered a VPN service which captured conversations users were having on AI platforms, selling it for marketing purposes.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-doctor.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 11:05:47.980366

Following the agreement, Uber will integrate TomTom’s maps, Maps APIs and live services across its global platform. The partnership will enhance Uber’s routing, fare calculations, and pick-up and drop-off accuracy, particularly in complex locations such as airports, transit hubs and stadiums. This is expected to reduce travel time and uncertainty while improving reliability and operational efficiency for both drivers and riders.

TomTom’s mapping platform continuously aggregates data from thousands of sources and processes billions of data points to keep maps current. The technological collaboration establishes a feedback loop in which anonymized real-world data from Uber trips is incorporated into TomTom’s maps, improving updates on roads, turn restrictions and closures.

Uber and TomTom are building on their long-standing partnership (the initial deal was inked in 2015) and actively exploring new opportunities to introduce additional location-based tools that will further expand the capabilities of the former’s platform and enhance the overall user experience.

We remind investors that way back in 2015, Uber had looked to buy Nokia's NOK mapping division, HERE, for around $3 billion. The aim of buying Nokia’s mapping division was to gain control of mapping technology for its core services and future self-driving cars. However, Uber ultimately lost its bid to buy Nokia’s mapping service, which was sold to a consortium of German automakers.

Following the failure to buy Nokia’s HERE, Uber partnered with TomTom and also acquired Microsoft's MSFT Bing Maps imagery division, bringing in talent and street-level data for autonomous vehicle development. Through this deal, Uber absorbed data-collection engineers from Microsoft to bolster its mapping work. Roughly 100 Microsoft employees joined Uber following the deal.

The tenure of Kraft Heinz's new Chief Executive, Steve Cahillane, begins with a significant and unexpected hurdle. A sudden shift in U.S. federal dietary guidelines, framed as a renewed offensive against sugar, poses a direct threat to the company's core business and complicates a major corporate restructuring plan already in motion.

Investor sentiment turned cautious following the policy announcement from Washington. Kraft Heinz shares are currently trading at $23.01, hovering near a 52-week low. This nervousness appears sector-wide, with peers like General Mills and Conagra Brands also recording losses. This pattern suggests a potential rotation away from traditional packaged food stocks as the market digests the long-term implications of the new health agenda.

Policy Reversal Targets Core Product Lines

The pressure stems from a pronounced reversal in U.S. health policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. The administration's updated guidelines now prioritize proteins and healthy fats, explicitly targeting processed foods and added sugars. A specific recommendation to limit consumption to a maximum of 10 grams of sugar per meal strikes at the heart of Kraft Heinz's product portfolio.

This new framework places the company's ""North American Grocery"" segment—home to iconic brands such as Lunchables, Oscar Mayer, and Kool-Aid—under immediate scrutiny. Market observers are not merely flagging a reputational risk but are warning of a tangible danger to a high-volume, core revenue stream.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

Planned Corporate Split Faces New Hurdles

The regulatory development arrives at a critical strategic juncture for Kraft Heinz. The company is planning to separate into two independent publicly traded entities in the second half of 2026: a growth-focused ""Global Taste Elevation"" business (encompassing brands like Heinz and Philadelphia) and the aforementioned ""North American Grocery"" division.

These new guidelines substantially complicate the valuation of the planned grocery spin-off. Should government-backed programs, including public school meal initiatives, align their purchasing with the stricter sugar and processing limits, the segment could face structural revenue declines. This risk may render the spin-off considerably less attractive to potential investors and could force management to reconsider the capital structure of the new entity.

All eyes are now on the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report in February. Analysts anticipate that CEO Cahillane will provide his first detailed commentary on the impact of the evolving political landscape during this update. From a technical analysis perspective, the situation remains tense; a breach of the support level at $22.50 could trigger further downward momentum for the stock.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2426822_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:43.716668

Ralph Lauren Investment Narrative Recap

To own Ralph Lauren, you need to believe its premium brand, pricing discipline, and capital returns can offset macro and wholesale volatility. The CFDA manufacturing grants are directionally consistent with its brand and supply chain focus, but do not materially change the key near term catalyst of sustaining pricing power or the main risk that softer demand and higher tariffs could pressure margins if consumers become more price sensitive.

The most relevant recent announcement here is Ralph Lauren’s reaffirmed outlook for mid single digit constant currency revenue growth and operating margin expansion in fiscal 2026, which keeps investor attention on execution in core regions rather than on these relatively small manufacturing grants. The grants sit alongside that guidance as one more data point that the company is investing in product and supply capabilities while managing inflation and wholesale rationalization.

Yet investors should be aware that higher prices and tariff costs could collide with...

Ralph Lauren's narrative projects $8.4 billion revenue and $1.0 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 5.0% yearly revenue growth and an earnings increase of roughly $200 million from $794.7 million today.

If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.

An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

(January 8, 2026) – Johnson & Johnson today announced Tony Hunter, Ph.D., of the Salk Institute as the recipient of the 2025 Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research. Dr. Hunter is honored for his role in the discovery of tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation as mechanisms for the malignant transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and other disease states.

“Dr. Hunter’s discoveries are the cornerstone upon which today’s cancer therapies have been built,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine R&D for Johnson & Johnson. “His groundbreaking work embodies the legacy and spirit of Dr. Paul Janssen and J&J’s ongoing commitment to cancer research – addressing patient needs and improving health for all.”

Dr. Hunter’s seminal discovery four decades ago paved the way for the development of more than 80 cancer therapies and sparked innovation in neuroimmunology, neurology, hematology, and autoimmune disorders. His lab at the Salk Institute continues to lead the field in understanding how chemical additions to proteins control the cell cycle and growth, leading to new potential therapeutic targets for cancers.

An independent committee of world-renowned scientists selected Dr. Hunter for this recognition. He joins 25 other scientists who have received the Dr. Paul Janssen Award since 2004, including ten who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.

“Dr. Hunter’s work stood out to the selection committee for its foundational impact in addressing one of the most pressing medical questions of our generation: Why do cancers thrive, and how do we stop them from growing? His discoveries have already made a great impact, and they continue to pave the way for new innovations in cancer therapies, improving outcomes for patients worldwide,” said Elaine Fuchs, Ph.D., Selection Committee Chair for the Dr. Paul Janssen Award. “As in every year, we had an impressive slate of researchers nominated for their exceptional work in the field of biomedical research.”

Johnson & Johnson will honor Dr. Hunter during a virtual symposium, cohosted with The New York Academy of Sciences on March 2, 2026. The symposium is free to anyone interested in celebrating scientific innovation. (Registration is required.)

“I am delighted to receive the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research,” Hunter said. “I discovered tyrosine phosphorylation as a cancer mechanism while carrying out studies with a simple chicken tumor virus, hoping our findings would give us clues as to how human cancer develops. This serendipitous discovery led to a whole new class of cancer drugs and underscores the importance of funding for basic biomedical research, which can lead to other breakthrough cancer treatments.”

The Dr. Paul Janssen Award builds on Dr. Hunter’s extensive list of international scientific awards and recognitions, including the AACR Lifetime Achievement Award in Cancer Research, the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Sjöberg Prize, among others.

The share price has been choppy recently, with a 1-day share price return of 2.19% decline, but the 90-day share price return of 30.78% suggests momentum has been building even as the 3-year total shareholder return of 28.36% decline shows a tougher longer term picture.

Another View: Multiples Still Point To Value While the popular narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne as roughly fairly priced, the pricing based on sales tells a different story.

The share price has been choppy recently, with a 1-day share price return of 2.19% decline, but the 90-day share price return of 30.78% suggests momentum has been building even as the 3-year total shareholder return of 28.36% decline shows a tougher longer term picture.

If HP’s swings have you rethinking your energy exposure, it could be a good moment to widen the search and look at as potential next ideas.

So with HP trading close to analyst targets but still showing a large modelled intrinsic discount and a mixed return profile, is this a reset that opens up value, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 0% Overvalued

Helmerich & Payne’s most followed narrative sees fair value at about US$30.27 per share, very close to the recent US$30.38 close. This frames an almost fully reflected valuation in the current price.

The company's growing international footprint, highlighted by the successful KCA integration and new tender opportunities in Saudi Arabia and Argentina, positions H&P to capture incremental market share and expand EBITDA as geopolitical instability and supply concerns reinforce demand for high-spec rigs.

Curious what underpins that near one to one match between model and market? Revenue, margins and a richer future earnings multiple all carry weight here.

Result: Fair Value of $30.27 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, you still need to weigh risks like potential rig overcapacity and H&P’s heavy North American exposure, which could pressure utilization, day rates, and cash generation.

Another View: Multiples Still Point To Value

While the popular narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne as roughly fairly priced, the pricing based on sales tells a different story. The current P/S ratio of 0.8x sits below both the fair ratio of 0.9x and the peer and industry averages of 1.2x and 1.1x. That gap suggests the market is assigning a discount that could either indicate caution or potential mispricing. Which side do you think it is?

'This tax equity close reflects the strong economic fundamentals of these solar assets, our ability to construct them efficiently and the growing depth of expertise in the organization,' said Thomas Houghton, CEO and President of Adapture

This commitment marks a major milestone as Adapture advances toward construction completion and commercial operation of the multi-site portfolio. Last year, the company announced a $321 million construction and tax credit bridge facility with MUFG, supporting the broader 441 MW Titanium portfolio, which spans three project sites in Arkansas and Illinois.

'This tax equity close reflects the strong economic fundamentals of these solar assets, our ability to construct them efficiently and the growing depth of expertise in the organization,' said Thomas Houghton, CEO and President of Adapture. 'We are pleased to further our long-standing partnership with U.S. Bank with these projects as we continue delivering high-quality, reliable solar assets to the market.'

U.S. Bank's tax equity investments are a critical source of funding for project construction. 'U.S. Bank invests in renewable energy projects that help strengthen the energy grid and drive local job creation,' said Eric Barr, senior vice president, Environmental Finance, U.S. Bank. 'We are proud to support our long-standing customer Adapture with our tax equity financing and expertise as it expands its Titanium portfolio and delivers clean energy generation.'

'Our teams worked closely and diligently to bring this over the finish line,' said Ben Schneider, Managing Director of Project Finance at Adapture. 'This closing is another major step forward for the Titanium projects, and we are grateful to the team at U.S. Bank for continuing to be a crucial partner in the growth of Adapture's portfolio.'

Construction began on the Titanium portfolio in September 2024, and the first projects are expected to reach commercial operation this year. Once operational, the portfolio is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 71,000 homes annually.

Not to be outdone, Goldman Sachs also entered the referral fray, offering its retail clients to major RIA customers; Creative Planning, Mercer Advisors and Wealth Enhancement are reportedly among the first to join.

The developments, which were first reported by FAIQ, Citywire and InvestmentNews, come as competition in the mid-tier wealth management segment heats up. Schwab significantly raised the barriers to entry for its own referral network late last month, doubling minimum AUM requirements to $500 million. While Schwab pivoted toward larger firms and wealthier clients (asset minimums now begin at $2 million instead of $500,000), BNY is keeping a more open-door policy:

Advisors using the Advisor Match service will face no AUM minimums.

There will be an annual fee of $50,000 and an annual asset-based fee of as much as 0.3% based on the value of the assets of the referred client, a potential barrier for advisors with less affluent customers.

There are also requirements like federal registration, a fee-based compensation model, and liability insurance and fidelity bond coverage, according to the Dec. 26 filing.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CzBHcum8J7NEJAeH.0BQ0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_daily_upside_435/9f1313a76ea5a760d369f47da75027e2,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:33.806409

For now, as the AI rally shows signs of fatigue, Wall Street’s attention is increasingly turning to the US consumer.","Strategists on Wall Street are increasingly looking beyond the artificial intelligence trade for fresh drivers of the US equity rally, as concerns grow that enthusiasm for AI-linked stocks may be cooling.

Attention is now shifting toward companies tied to middle-income consumer spending, which some investors see as better positioned to benefit from a broadening economic expansion in 2026.

A team at Goldman Sachs Group, led by strategist Ben Snider, has identified a range of stocks that could gain as household finances improve and spending accelerates.

Their focus is not on essential goods alone, but increasingly on discretionary products and services that consumers buy when confidence rises.

Goldman targets middle-income consumer spending

In a note to investors dated January 6, Snider and his colleagues argued that stocks exposed to middle-income consumers are “particularly attractive” at this stage of the cycle.

The team expects real income growth for this group to accelerate, which will support higher sales growth for companies with steady demand and relatively thin margins.

Goldman’s preferred sectors include healthcare providers, materials producers, and makers of everyday consumer goods.

However, the strongest conviction lies with businesses selling “nice-to-have” products rather than necessities.

This includes retailers of upscale apparel and accessories, household goods manufacturers, tour operators, and casinos.

The call reflects Goldman’s broader expectation that value stocks will continue to outperform into early 2026.

According to the firm, easing pressure from tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump, a stabilising labour market, and tax rebates linked to last year’s major legislation should all help underpin consumer spending.

Retail stocks gain as investors rotate away from AI

The shift in sentiment comes as investors look for alternatives to the AI trade that has dominated markets for the past three years, largely driven by the so-called “Magnificent Seven” technology companies.

With valuations stretched in parts of the tech sector, some investors are increasingly exploring areas that have lagged in recent years.

The S&P Retail Select Industry Index, which includes companies such as CarMax, Etsy, and Academy Sports & Outdoors, is already showing signs of renewed interest.

The index is up 3.5% since the start of the year and has gained 8.8% since early November, coinciding with the peak holiday shopping season.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the US economy to grow by 2.1% this year, with consumer spending providing a key boost.

This outlook has supported a gradual rotation into more traditional value-oriented sectors.

“There is a repricing of economic growth higher,” said Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities International.

He added that such a shift tends to favour value stocks over higher-priced growth names.

Dick’s Sporting Goods highlights early winners

One early beneficiary of the rotation has been Dick’s Sporting Goods.

Shares in the US retailer have risen 6.1% in the first four trading days of 2026, recovering some of the ground lost in 2025, when the stock fell 13%.

Options activity suggests some investors are betting on further gains.

Susquehanna International Group, in a Bloomberg report, said a recent trade could generate up to $3.5 million if the stock moves back toward its early-2025 high of $250 a share.

Dick’s is among several retailers highlighted by Goldman as having strong exposure to rising middle-class wealth, alongside Burlington Stores, Best Buy, Five Below, Levi Strauss, and Gap.

While traditional retailers continue to face competition from e-commerce giants, the search for value amid lofty tech valuations appears to be drawing investor interest elsewhere.

For now, as the AI rally shows signs of fatigue, Wall Street’s attention is increasingly turning to the US consumer.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:46.885030

NEW YORK, Jan. 08, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc . (Nasdaq: LXEO), a clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to pioneering novel treatments for cardiovascular diseases, today announced a research collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, a global leader in cardiovascular health, to investigate localized cardiac delivery of gene therapy. The collaboration seeks to advance the potential efficacy and safety profile of gene therapy for genetically mediated cardiovascular diseases by concentrating AAV (adeno associated viral) delivery to the heart by investigating cutting-edge routes of administration using Impella™ heart pump technology. Impella heart pumps provide direct cardiac unloading to enhance myocardial perfusion, which may help delivery of gene therapy.

“This collaboration represents an exciting step toward unlocking the full potential of cardiac gene therapy,” said R.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Lexeo’s expectations regarding the partnership and potential of genetic medicines to treat cardiac diseases. Words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “objective,” “intend,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “would,” “expect,” “believe,” “design,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “develop,” “plan” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions, or statements regarding intent, belief, or current expectations, are forward-looking statements. While Lexeo believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on any such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon current information available to the company as well as certain estimates and assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties (including, without limitation, those set forth in Lexeo’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)), many of which are beyond the company’s control and subject to change. Actual results could be materially different from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to: risks and uncertainties related to global macroeconomic conditions and related volatility; expectations regarding the initiation, progress, and expected results of Lexeo’s preclinical studies, clinical trials and research and development programs; the unpredictable relationship between preclinical study results and clinical study results; delays in submission of regulatory filings or failure to receive regulatory approval; liquidity and capital resources; and other risks and uncertainties identified in Lexeo’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025, filed with the SEC on November 5, and subsequent future filings Lexeo may make with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties. Lexeo claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. Lexeo expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter any statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation.","If you are wondering whether Eli Lilly's share price still makes sense at around US$1,108, you are not alone. Many investors are asking what they are really paying for at this level.

The stock has recently posted returns of 3.1% over the last 7 days, 11.1% over the last 30 days, 2.6% year to date, 41.8% over the last year and a very large gain over 5 years, which naturally raises questions about growth potential and changes in perceived risk.

Recent headlines have focused on Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes treatments, which have been a key talking point for the company and the sector. Media coverage has often linked these products to investor interest, helping frame how the market is thinking about the current share price.

Our valuation work gives Eli Lilly a . Next we will walk through the main valuation approaches investors commonly use and then finish with a different way of thinking about what the stock could be worth.

Eli Lilly scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the .

Approach 1: Eli Lilly Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today using a required rate of return. It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in current terms.

For Eli Lilly, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $6.2b. Analysts supply detailed Free Cash Flow estimates for several years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path, reaching a projected Free Cash Flow of $59.2b in 2035. These projections, all in $, are then discounted to arrive at a single estimate of value per share.

On this basis, Eli Lilly’s DCF fair value is calculated at US$1,253.18 per share, compared with a current share price of about US$1,108. That implies an intrinsic discount of roughly 11.6%, which indicates that the shares are trading below this cash flow based estimate of value.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Eli Lilly is undervalued by 11.6%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Eli Lilly Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Eli Lilly, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It links directly to the bottom line, which is usually what ultimately matters to shareholders.

What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to go with a lower P/E.

Eli Lilly currently trades on about 53.89x earnings, compared with the Pharmaceuticals industry average of about 19.90x and a peer group average of about 16.96x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Eli Lilly is 42.45x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be, given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and identified risks.

Because the Fair Ratio incorporates those company specific drivers, it can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry. With the current P/E of 53.89x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 42.45x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.

Result: OVERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation. On Simply Wall St that starts with Narratives, which are your own story for Eli Lilly that links what you believe about its GLP 1 opportunity, risks and margins to a forecast for revenue, earnings and cash flows, and then to a fair value you can compare with today’s price.

On the Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an easy tool to set their assumptions and see a live fair value that updates when new earnings, news or regulatory developments come through. This means you can always see how fresh information might affect your view.

For Eli Lilly right now, one Narrative on the platform uses a fair value of about US$1,189 per share, while another uses about US$1,093. This shows how two investors can look at the same company and reach different, but clearly explained, conclusions based on their own expectations and discount rates.

For Eli Lilly however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Eli Lilly Narratives:

Each one ties the same core facts about GLP 1 demand, pricing, and policy into a different conclusion about what the current US$1,108.09 share price could mean for you.

🐂 Eli Lilly Bull Case

Fair value used in this Narrative: about US$1,189.18 per share

Implied discount to this fair value: about 6.8% below the Narrative value

Revenue growth assumption: 20%

Tirzepatide drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound are treated as the core engine for earnings, with numbers cited for 2024 to 2026 sales expectations and a focus on capacity expansion to meet demand.

The author highlights long patent protection, low GLP 1 penetration in a 100m to 120m U.S. addressable market and gradually improving insurance coverage as key supports for the story.

Risks flagged include high monthly pricing, new entrants, potential side effects and lawsuits, and a high current P/E, but the Narrative still arrives at a fair value around US$1,200 based on 20% to 25% revenue growth over 3 to 5 years and a 9% discount rate.

🐻 Eli Lilly Bear Case

Fair value used in this Narrative: about US$1,093.22 per share

Implied premium to this fair value: about 1.4% above the Narrative value

Revenue growth assumption: 18.12%

This Narrative leans on analyst assumptions that revenue grows at about 18.7% a year over 3 years, profit margins widen from 25.9% to 38.4% and earnings reach US$34.2b by around September 2028, but questions whether the P/E can stay at a premium level.

It stresses concentration in a handful of GLP 1 products, exposure to drug price controls and reimbursement decisions, and competition from generics, compounders and other large pharma as possible sources of pressure on margins and volumes.

With a consensus price target of US$891.62 based on those earnings, margin and discount rate assumptions, it concludes that investors need to be comfortable with policy risk, execution risk on manufacturing scale up and litigation overhangs to justify paying close to or above US$1,100.

If you feel one of these fits how you think Eli Lilly’s story plays out, you can use it as a starting point to build or adjust your own assumptions, rather than relying only on a single fair value number.

Johnson & Johnson Investment Narrative Recap

To own Johnson & Johnson today, you need to believe in its ability to replace maturing blockbusters with a broad mix of new medicines and MedTech products while managing legal and cost pressures. The latest nipocalimab and OTTAVA updates support that pipeline story, but they do not materially change the near term focus on how loss of exclusivity, litigation and orthopedics restructuring shape earnings and cash generation over the next few years.

Among recent announcements, the positive Phase 2b JASMINE data for nipocalimab in systemic lupus erythematosus stands out, as it reinforces Johnson & Johnson’s emphasis on Innovative Medicine as a key growth driver. For investors tracking catalysts, this lupus program sits alongside other immunology and oncology efforts as part of the broader effort to offset STELARA erosion and support the company’s long running dividend profile.

Investors responded to Zeta pushing its platform beyond reporting and orchestration tools toward something closer to an operating layer for marketing decisions.

At the centre of its shift is Athena, Zeta’s AI agent, which the company is expanding by integrating OpenAI’s models. The intent is to let marketing teams interact with data and campaign systems using natural language, rather than navigating dashboards, queries, and rule sets. Features like Insights and Advisor, currently in beta, are designed to answer questions, surface patterns, and suggest actions in campaigns.

The move is about product direction. For enterprise brands that rely on platforms like Zeta to run large parts of their marketing operations, it is about something more practical: how work gets done when analysis, guidance, and execution start to blur into a single layer.

When marketing platforms start to guide decisions, not just report results

Marketing teams already sit on vast amounts of data. Performance metrics, audience behaviour, channel results, and spend information are usually available in near real time. The challenge has never been access alone, but interpretation. Turning that data into decisions still requires time, people, and coordination in teams. AI agents are being positioned as a way to compress that cycle.

Instead of asking analysts to pull reports or waiting for weekly reviews, teams could ask why performance shifted, which audiences changed, or how a budget tweak might affect outcomes. The system can respond using the data already inside the platform, framed in language that non-technical users can act on.

That shift sounds incremental, but it changes the role of marketing technology inside an organisation. Platforms stop being places where work is reviewed after the fact and start acting as environments where decisions are shaped as campaigns run.

Where AI agents fit – and where they don’t

Still, what this enables is not the same as what it replaces. Strategy, creative direction, and brand judgement remain human responsibilities. Zeta’s AI tools are framed as support layers, not substitutes. The agent may suggest actions, but teams retain control over whether and how those actions are taken.

Enterprise marketing does not operate in a vacuum: Campaigns are shaped by legal constraints, brand rules, regional differences, and commercial priorities that rarely fit cleanly into automated logic. Any system that oversteps the boundaries risks slowing adoption.

Another tension emanates from the trust factor. As AI agents move closer to execution, marketing leaders will need to understand how suggestions are generated and what data is being used. The promise of speed only holds if teams are confident they can explain and defend decisions made with AI support. Black-box recommendations, even if accurate, can be hard to justify in regulated or high-risk environments.

The OpenAI partnership highlights a dependency shift. Brands are becoming indirect users of large models, even if they never interact with them directly. Model updates, behaviour changes, and reliability issues can ripple into daily operations. That raises questions about resilience and oversight that go beyond marketing teams alone.

For many organisations, adoption will likely be uneven. Some teams may use AI agents to explore data or draft scenarios, while others keep them confined to narrow tasks. The same platform may be used very differently in regions or business units, depending on risk tolerance and maturity.

What Zeta’s move shows is not that AI-driven marketing is ready to run itself, but that the centre of gravity is shifting. Marketing technology isn’t about collecting data and measuring outcomes, but is becoming a space where interpretation, suggestion, and action coexist.

The decision is not whether to use tools like Athena, but how much authority to grant them. As AI agents become part of the infrastructure rather than optional features, teams will need to define clear guardrails, approval paths, and success measures that go beyond speed or efficiency.

IBM and The All England Lawn Tennis Club announce a multi-year renewal of their long-standing technology partnership.

From the launch of the Wimbledon website in 1995 and the mobile application in 2009, to the first integration of enhanced AI-powered solutions in 2017, IBM and the All England Club have collaborated for 36 years to deepen global fan engagement across Wimbledon’s digital platforms.

The new agreement is focused on initiatives to expand the event’s global reach and achieve a deeper fan engagement across Wimbledon’s digital ecosystem in 2026 and beyond.

Teams from IBM and the All England Club work together year-round to co-create unique fan experiences — such as Live Likelihood to Win and Match Chat — that combine the significant quantity of data generated during The Championships with the deep AI capabilities of IBM watsonx. In 2025, these efforts contributed to a 16% year-on-year increase in engagement across all platforms, with more than 20 million fans closely following all the grass court action via the app and website. The app alone saw a 19% increase in engagement and received an average rating of 4.9 stars in app stores.

The partnership has also won multiple awards, including the All England Club being recognized as ‘Sports Organization of the Year’ at the 2025 Sports Technology Awards, for the innovative use of AI and technology to transform the Wimbledon fan experience.

“We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,” says Usama Al-Qassab, Marketing & Commercial Director, The All England Lawn Tennis Club. “For 36 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships.

The companies plan to begin offering passenger rides in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year, marking a significant step toward large-scale robotaxi deployment.

Each partner plays a distinct role in the project. Lucid supplies the vehicle platform, using its Gravity electric SUV as the foundation. Nuro contributes the autonomous driving system, replacing the human driver with its software-based Nuro Driver. Uber integrates the vehicle into its ride-hailing ecosystem, giving riders access through the familiar Uber app.

In practice, this means customers could soon be picked up by a self-driving Lucid vehicle ordered like any other Uber ride.

The Gravity-based robotaxi, unveiled at CES 2026, has been extensively modified for autonomous operation. Classified as a Level 4 vehicle, it is designed to handle most driving situations independently within defined areas. To achieve this, the vehicle relies on a comprehensive sensor suite combining cameras, radar, and LiDAR.

These sensors are seamlessly integrated into the vehicle’s body, along with a roof-mounted “halo” module that provides a full 360-degree view of the surroundings.

At the core of the system is the Nuro Driver software running on Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computing platform. This setup processes vast amounts of sensor data in real time, enabling the vehicle to make rapid and safe driving decisions. Road testing of the autonomous Gravity began in December, laying the groundwork for its commercial rollout.

Passenger experience has been a major focus. The roof-mounted halo includes external displays that show riders’ initials as the vehicle approaches, making it easy to identify in crowded locations.

Inside, passengers sit in the second row and are welcomed by a screen that displays their name, route, and trip details. Riders remain in control, initiating the journey themselves by tapping a “Start Drive” command.

During the trip, the screen explains the vehicle’s actions, such as yielding to pedestrians or changing lanes, helping build confidence and transparency. Climate controls, heated seats, and media settings are also accessible, along with options to contact support or request a safe stop.

Designed for practicality, the robotaxi can accommodate up to six passengers with generous luggage space. Lucid is expected to begin production of the autonomous vehicles at its Arizona facility later this year. Uber aims to deploy as many as 20,000 of these robotaxis over six years, with expansion planned across multiple global markets.",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/uber_robotaxi_dd5babafbd.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 14:02:24.908479

Nvidia (NVDA) is tightening its sales terms in China, asking customers to pay the full amount up front for its H200 AI chips, according to a Reuters report. The move comes as Beijing has yet to clearly approve shipments, creating risk around delivery timelines.

Under the new terms, Chinese buyers must pay the full amount upfront when placing an order. Once submitted, orders cannot be canceled, refunded, or changed. In certain cases, customers may use commercial insurance or pledged assets as collateral to secure payment instead of paying the full amount in cash. Nvidia and China’s industry ministry have not commented on the policy yet.

China Approval Delays Push Nvidia to Toughen Terms

The tougher terms reflect uncertainty in China’s approval process. While Nvidia has long asked for advance payments from Chinese clients, it previously allowed partial deposits. For the H200, the company is being stricter because it is unclear when regulators will allow shipments.

Adding to the delay, Chinese authorities have asked local tech firms to pause new orders for Nvidia’s H200 chips, which Washington recently approved for export to China. Chinese government regulators are deciding how many locally made chips companies must buy along with each H200 order, which has slowed approvals.

Nvidia Sees Strong H200 Demand Despite China Hurdles

Despite the hurdles, demand remains strong. Chinese companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, priced at about $27,000 each, far above Nvidia’s current inventory of 700,000 chips.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the H200 chip remains “quite high” and that the company has ramped up its supply chain. Notably, the H200 delivers much stronger performance than the now-blocked H20 and still outperforms most domestic chips for large-scale AI training.

Nvidia Shifts Risk to Buyers

Nvidia has reason to be cautious. Last year, the company took a $5.5 billion inventory write-down after a sudden export ban on earlier chips. While U.S. policy now allows H200 sales with a fee paid to Washington, China has since blocked H20 shipments, keeping the risk high.

By asking for full payment upfront, Nvidia protects itself if approvals are delayed again. The financial risk now sits with buyers, who must commit cash without certainty on delivery.

Is NVDA Stock a Buy?

On TipRanks, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $263.76 implies 39.5% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA stock has gained nearly 35%.

CEO Jensen Huang said this week that Nvidia (NVDA) is looking forward to selling its H200 AI chip in China after winning President Donald Trump's approval in exchange for agreeing to give the U.S. government a 25% cut of sales. CFO Colette Kress said Tuesday that the U.S. government is ""working feverishly"" on the details, and the company expects to begin shipping to China soon.

But the Chinese government's latest moves to halt sales could hobble those plans. Beijing has ordered companies to halt H200 orders, and could follow with a mandate that firms buy domestic chips instead, The Information reported Wednesday. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, the company is imposing more stringent terms on Chinese clients looking to buy the H200 amid the uncertainty, such as full upfront payment without options to cancel, according to a Reuters report Thursday. Nvidia did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication.

More access to China's market, which Huang has said could be a $50 billion annual opportunity for Nvidia, would represent a significant source of growth for the company. (Nvidia is expected to report full-year revenue above $210 billion.) The chipmaker's latest forecasts did not take China sales of the H200, or H20 that Trump greenlighted back in August, into consideration.

The H20, a less-powerful chip designed specifically for China's market, has also met challenges from Beijing after receiving Trump's backing. The approvals also face opposition at home, with bipartisan efforts by U.S. lawmakers in recent weeks to block the sales.

In a note to clients Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley nodded to possible sales of the AI chips in China as a source of potential upside for the company, but excluded them from their base case for the stock amid lingering worries about political barriers. Analysts at Jefferies and Bernstein, who like Morgan Stanley hold ""buy"" or equivalent ratings on the stock, have also voiced some skepticism about the likelihood of sales.

Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% in Thursday morning trading, leaving them little changed for 2026 after climbing close to 40% last year.

Second IDE approved for U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Johnson & Johnson today announced that the company has submitted the OTTAVA™ Robotic Surgical System to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an application for De Novo classification. Leveraging data from the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, the company has applied for marketing authorization in multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen.

“We have taken learnings from Johnson & Johnson’s 140 years in surgery, our decades of leadership in minimally invasive surgery, and the experiences robotic surgeons and hospitals have had over the past 20 years to design a soft tissue robotic system built for the future of surgery,” said Hani Abouhalka, Company Group Chair, Surgery, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “I am proud of the design decisions and major scientific efforts that have gone into the system to support surgeons and successfully complete our first clinical trial, and I look forward to reaching the next milestone on our path to commercialization.”

Data from first clinical trial supporting submission

First cases in the OTTAVA IDE study were completed in early 2025 at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center by Dr. Erik Wilson*, Chief of Minimally Invasive and Elective General Surgery UT Health Houston and the lead investigator for the clinical study.

OTTAVA’s unique unified architecture, surgical instrumentation powered by Ethicon expertise, and future connection to the Polyphonic™ digital ecosystem are designed to address the unmet needs of surgeons and their teams. The Company filed data from the completed clinical trial with the aim of showcasing safety and effectiveness and supporting the system’s ability to perform a variety of procedures. Given OTTAVA’s novel architecture and differentiated technological capabilities, the company filed a De Novo classification request and is targeting an indication covering multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen, such as gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the OTTAVA system and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “Surgeon investigators across several hospitals led this important study to further clinical evidence in support of minimally invasive, robotic-assisted surgery for the benefit of clinical teams, hospitals, and patients.”

Second clinical trial approved in hernia repair

OTTAVA is designed as a multi-specialty soft-tissue surgery robot, supporting a broad range of procedures across patient anatomy and surgical specialties, including the most complex surgeries that require a multi-quadrant approach. In late 2025, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval to begin a U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures, one of the most common surgeries in the U.S.1

The OTTAVA robotic system is under development and is not authorized to be marketed or sold in any market. For more information, visit: http://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/surgical-robotics.

NEW YORK (AP) — Warner Bros. again rejected a takeover bid from Paramount and told shareholders Wednesday to stick with a rival offer from Netflix.

Warner’s leadership has repeatedly rebuffed Skydance-owned Paramount’s overtures — and urged shareholders just weeks ago to back the sale of its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. Paramount, meanwhile, has made efforts to sweeten its $77.9 billion hostile offer for the entire company.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday that its board determined Paramount’s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.

“Paramount’s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,” Warner Bros. Discovery Chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement. In contrast, he added, the company’s agreement with Netflix “will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty.”

Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s hostile bid is still on the table. Warner shareholders currently have until Jan. 21 to “tender” their shares.

Late last month, Paramount announced an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle founder Larry Ellison — who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison — to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for the company’s offer. Paramount also increased its promised payout to shareholders to $5.8 billion if the deal is blocked by regulators, matching Netflix’s breakup fee.

In its Wednesday letter to shareholders, Warner expressed concerns about a potential deal with Paramount. Warner said it essentially considers the offer a leveraged buyout, which includes a lot of debt, and also pointed to operating restrictions that it said were imposed by Paramount’s offer and could “hamper WBD’s ability to perform” throughout a transaction.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount wants the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes networks like CNN and Discovery.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s news and cable operations would be spun off into their own company, under a previously-announced separation.

A merger with either company could take over a year to close — and will attract tremendous antitrust scrutiny along the way. Due to its size and potential impact, it will almost certainly trigger a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which could sue to block the transaction or request changes. Other countries and regulators overseas may also challenge the merger. And politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Trade groups across the entertainment industry have continued to sound the alarm about both deals.",https://krmg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25339454648803-scaled.webp,N,,2026-01-08 04:58:50.151677

It encompasses well-known brands such as Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten, and Dieterba, along with the Latina production facility.

Founded in 1902, Plasmon is registered as a ‘Historic Trademark of National Interest’ in Italy, where it is a household name synonymous with trust and quality.

Baby Food Production

The Latina plant, which employs approximately 300 people, produces a wide range of infant food and specialised nutrition products, including roughly 1.8 million Plasmon items annually.

Under a co-packing agreement, the facility will continue to produce Heinz Baby Food for the UK market.

As of 31 December 2024, Plasmon reported revenues of around €170 million and an EBITDA of €17 million.

For NewPrinces, this deal significantly strengthens its presence in the baby and specialised food market, particularly across Italy and Europe.

The company expects that the acquisition will drive increased revenue and profit margins, with expected annual revenue growth of around 3% and EBITDA margins reaching 15% in the medium term.

Additionally, it will increase production capacity by combining the Latina plant with NewPrinces’ Ozzano Taro facility and expand Plasmon’s international footprint.

Princes Italia

Princes Italia (a NewPrinces subsidiary) will operate Plasmon’s business under a three-year lease agreement, paying €3 million in annual rent plus 1.5% of revenues.

Angelo Mastrolia, chairman of NewPrinces, commented, ""Bringing home brands like Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten, and Dieterba—which have deep roots in our country's identity—alongside a highly efficient production plant such as the Latina factory, solidifies our position as a leading platform in the high-margin baby and specialised food segment in Italy and Europe.”",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvZXNtbWFnYXppbmUtcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjZcXFwvMDFcXFwvMDcxNjA1MjRcXFwvUGxhc21vbi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvaW1nLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImZjZjdjODY5Mzk1N2U4NWYwYjc5OTRhNGZkNWYzZDdlYTNkOWNlMGQifQ==/newprinces-group-completes-plasmon-acquisition.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 03:13:22.169174

For fiscal 2026, the company is guiding to a low-single-digit decline in that segment.","Economists use “K-shaped recovery” to describe divergence, where one part of an economy improves while another crumbles. The term gained traction during the pandemic to describe unequal post-COVID outcomes across income groups, sectors and firms. Now the concept fits the fortunes of lab equipment companies, among other things. Major vendors have posted strong numbers in recent earnings, yet the mood among academic researchers remains more muted.

The destocking hangover ends

For equipment suppliers, a single word defined the past two years: destocking. After pandemic-era stockpiling left pharmaceutical and biotech customers sitting on excess inventory, order volumes collapsed. Companies burned through their safety stocks.

That headwind has finally eased. Thermo Fisher Scientific reported Q3 2025 revenue of $11.1 billion, with its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment generating nearly $6 billion. Danaher, the bioprocessing bellwether, noted “continued momentum” in its filtration and purification business during its Q3 call. Agilent Technologies posted 7.2% core revenue growth in its Q4 fiscal 2025, with management highlighting strength in industrial and applied markets (chemicals, advanced materials, and environmental testing) as a counterweight to softer life sciences demand.

Drug manufacturing is non-discretionary. You cannot produce a dose of a GLP-1 agonist or a monoclonal antibody without consuming filtration media, chromatography resins, and single-use bags. As biologic pipelines advance and production scales, consumables follow.

The NIH question mark

The academic side of the market, in some respects faces more acute challenges. In February 2025, NIH announced a policy capping indirect cost reimbursement at 15% of grant awards. For research universities accustomed to negotiated rates of 50% or higher, the implications were severe. SUNY estimated an immediate $79 million hit to its research enterprise.

But the policy never took effect. Twenty-two states sued, and a federal judge blocked implementation in February 2025. A nationwide injunction followed in March. On January 5, 2026, an appeals court upheld that injunction, meaning the cap remains legally stalled.

The result is more limbo than crisis. University administrators, uncertain whether the cap will eventually survive judicial review, have adopted conservative postures. Capital expenditure decisions that might have been routine (a new mass spectrometer for a core facility, an upgrade to the microscopy suite) now face additional scrutiny.

The numbers bear this out. In Agilent’s Q4 fiscal 2025 results, released November 24, academia and government revenue declined 10%. For fiscal 2026, the company is guiding to a low-single-digit decline in that segment. Pharma, by contrast, grew 12% in the same quarter.

Where the money flows

Recurring revenue streams (consumables, service contracts, reagent kits) remain robust regardless of capital budget cycles. Companies with exposure to industrial and applied markets have found insulation from academic uncertainty. Semiconductor manufacturing, battery R&D and PFAS testing regulations are driving demand for analytical instrumentation on a separate track from NIH funding dynamics.

Bioprocessing consumables, pharma services and industrial applications are carrying the sector. Academic researchers, meanwhile, are waiting on Washington and the courts. For them, 2026 may be another year on the sidelines.",https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-8.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 04:00:11.419245

The device, which HP characterized as the world's first full AI PC built into a keyboard form factor, aims to address growing enterprise demand for computing hardware that adapts to increasingly fluid work environments.

The EliteBoard G1a integrates a complete desktop-class PC—including an AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processor delivering over 50 TOPS of neural processing power—into a keyboard chassis measuring just 12mm thick and weighing 750 grams, according to HP. The device functions as a standalone Copilot+ PC that connects to any display, fundamentally changing the traditional desktop paradigm by making high-performance computing fully portable.

""Work is being redesigned in real time—where it happens, how it happens, and what tools employees need to stay productive,"" Guayente Sanmartin, Senior Vice President and Division President of Commercial Systems & Displays Solutions at HP Inc., said in a statement. ""HP's focus is to remove the friction and complexity that slows people down and turn emerging AI into a real advantage.""

Enterprise demand drives form factor innovation

The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with evolving workplace dynamics that require computing infrastructure to support both traditional desk-based work and more mobile, collaborative scenarios. HP cited findings from its 2025 Work Relationship Index showing that only 44 percent of workers believe their technology fits their working style, the company said.

The EliteBoard G1a represents HP's response to this challenge by collapsing the desktop form factor into something that can move between home offices, corporate workspaces, and shared collaboration areas without sacrificing performance. The device includes dual microphones and speakers integrated into the keyboard housing, eliminating the need for separate peripherals in many scenarios.

From a specifications standpoint, the EliteBoard G1a delivers what HP characterized as desktop-level AI performance through its AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processor, which provides over 50 TOPS of neural processing capability for local AI workloads. This positions the device to handle Copilot+ PC workloads including real-time transcription, translation, and AI-assisted content generation without relying on cloud connectivity, according to the company.

Security and manageability for IT organizations

For IT decision-makers, HP emphasized the device's security architecture, which includes HP Wolf Security for Business with hardware-enforced protection against firmware attacks. The company noted that the security framework has been designed to defend against emerging quantum computing threats, a consideration that is becoming increasingly relevant for enterprise security planning.

The EliteBoard also features a physical security tether and lockable cable option, addressing concerns about securing highly portable computing assets in shared or public work environments. HP characterized the device as an EPEAT 2.0 Gold Registered Product, which may factor into purchasing decisions for organizations with sustainability mandates.

The device incorporates HP Smart Sense and AMD's Auto State Management technology to dynamically adjust performance, cooling, and battery optimization based on workload and environment, the company said. An optional built-in battery configuration extends the device's utility for scenarios where desk-based power connectivity is inconsistent or unavailable.

Premium display technology complements new form factor

Alongside the EliteBoard announcement, HP introduced the Series 7 Pro 4K Monitor featuring what the company described as the world's first Neo:LED desktop display technology. The 31.5-inch monitor delivers IPS black panel performance with a 2,700:1 contrast ratio—double that of traditional IPS displays—and includes factory color calibration for professional creative workflows, according to HP.

The monitor provides 140W power delivery through Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, enabling single-cable solutions for the EliteBoard and other compatible devices. HP emphasized the monitor's 40Gbps data throughput capability as a key feature for professionals working with large files or multiple high-resolution displays.

Market positioning and availability

The EliteBoard G1a and Series 7 Pro 4K Monitor are expected to be available through HP.com beginning in March 2026, the company said. HP did not disclose pricing information in the announcement but indicated that pricing details would be provided closer to the availability date.

The EliteBoard G1a received recognition as a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree prior to its formal unveiling at the trade show. HP positioned the device as part of its broader strategy to reimagine workplace computing for hybrid and distributed work environments, emphasizing flexibility and AI-powered productivity as key differentiators.

The announcement reflects broader industry trends toward more flexible computing form factors as enterprises seek to equip knowledge workers with tools that support multiple working styles and locations. Whether the keyboard-PC form factor gains traction in enterprise environments will likely depend on IT organizations' willingness to support a departure from traditional desktop and laptop paradigms, particularly regarding asset management, security policies, and user support considerations.",https://www.varindia.com/storage/news/2026/01/WkPkS4Zf1VWI0I48ODJFFftYqgfBmQxx3hovvELz.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 04:00:38.905948

It’s full of nostalgia and can instantly take you back to your childhood with every spoonful. Cereal will always be a special and satisfying treat for me, especially Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Everything about it is perfect: the amount of cinnamon, the small toast-like pieces, and that crunch. And no matter how much time passes, every bowl of it is as delicious as the last time I had it.

But these days, the General Mills brand has more than just cereal. Its signature Cinnadust flavor has been featured on everything from Muddy Buddies to coffee creamer to actual actual bacon. And now, the iconic seasoning is at Dollar Tree for the cheapest I've seen.

Nvidia has been caught between Washington and Beijing, as the United States tightens controls on exports of advanced semiconductors used in AI, while Chinese companies seek to reduce reliance ‌on US-designed chips.

Tensions over technology trade have been a central ‌feature of broader US-China conflicts, with semiconductors emerging as a strategic flashpoint.

China's directive to suspend orders was issued as the government considers whether, and under what conditions, to allow access to Nvidia's high-performance chips.

Beijing is aiming to discourage local technology companies from rushing to stockpile US chips before a decision is reached, the report said.

""China is committed to ‍basing its national development on its own strengths, and is also willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with all parties to safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains,"" said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US

Nvidia did not immediately ​respond to a Reuters request for ‌comment and China's Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately return calls outside business hours.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ​said at the Consumer Electronics Show this week that demand in China for its H200 chip ⁠was strong and the company is viewing ‌purchase orders as a signal of approval rather than expecting any formal announcement ​from Beijing.

US export licenses for the chips are still being processed, with no set timeline.

Late last year, US President Donald Trump's administration approved the export ‍of H200 chips to China, a significant reversal of previous bans on advanced AI hardware.

The ⁠approval was based on a condition that the company pay a unique 25 per cent revenue-sharing tax to ​the US government.

The H200 is ‌the predecessor to Nvidia's current flagship ""Blackwell"" chips.

British banking behemoth Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) has ventured into the stablecoin settlement space with its first-of-a-kind investment in Ubyx, according to a report published Wednesday.

Barclays’ Entry Into Stablecoin Industry?

Barclays bought a stake in Ubyx as part of its plans to explore “new forms of digital money,” Reuters reported.

“As the landscape of tokens, blockchains and wallets evolves, specialist technology will play a pivotal role in delivering connectivity and infrastructure to enable regulated financial institutions to interact seamlessly,” Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays, told Benzinga.

The banking giant said it will collaborate with Ubyx to develop “tokenised money within the regulatory perimeter.”

The exact details of the investment and the valuation were not disclosed.

Ubyx, founded in 2025, is a clearing system that lets anyone deposit stablecoins, from various issuers and currencies, into regular bank or fintech accounts and redeem them. The company’s corporate office is in New York, according to private market financial platform Pitchbook.

Barclays’ Bet On Crypto

This is not Barclays’ first foray into the world of digital currencies. Back in 2015, it became the first major UK bank to accept Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) .

The bank has praised blockchain, the ledger-like technology that powers Bitcoin, as an innovative system that may significantly benefit traditional banking.

Price Action: Barclays shares rose 0.95% in after-hours trading after closing 0.27% lower at $26.25 during Tuesday's regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The stock has nearly doubled in value over the past year.

BCS exhibited a very high Momentum score — a measure of the stock’s relative strength based on its price movement patterns and volatility over multiple timeframes. How does it compare with other banking stocks? Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to find out.
