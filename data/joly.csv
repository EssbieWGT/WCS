From 2024 to 2025, strategic investments in robotics infrastructure have emerged as a critical catalyst for AI adoption, delivering measurable returns on investment (ROI) across sectors. This article explores how enterprises are leveraging robotics to accelerate AI integration, the financial and operational benefits they're reaping, and why investors should prioritize this transformative synergy.

The Robotics-AI Synergy: A New Industrial Paradigm

Robotics infrastructure is evolving from rigid, task-specific machines to intelligent, adaptive systems powered by AI. Three key advancements are driving this shift:

1. Analytical AI enables robots to process vast sensor data, adapting to dynamic environments. For example, BMW's AI-powered computer vision systems reduced vehicle defects by 60% by analyzing real-time production line data.

2. Physical AI uses simulated environments to train robots, reducing deployment costs. Startups like Boston Dynamics are pioneering humanoid robots that learn from virtual trials, slashing development timelines.

3. Generative AI is revolutionizing robotics design and simulation. Shell's AI-driven predictive maintenance system processes 20 billion sensor readings weekly, preventing equipment failures and saving millions in downtime.

These innovations are not isolated experiments. The global industrial robotics market hit $16.5 billion in 2025, with AI startups securing $107 billion in funding. This surge reflects a broader trend: enterprises are no longer asking if to adopt AI but how to scale it effectively.

ROI in Action: Case Studies from the Frontlines

Strategic robotics investments are delivering quantifiable ROI across industries:

- Walmart optimized its supply chain with AI, saving $75 million annually by refining truck routing and load efficiency. The system also cut CO₂ emissions by 72 million pounds, aligning with sustainability goals.

- JPMorgan Chase automated 360,000 staff hours yearly via its COIN platform, which reviews loan agreements with near-perfect accuracy. This freed employees to focus on high-value client interactions.

- CarMax used generative AI to summarize 100,000 customer reviews into 5,000 actionable insights in months—a task that would have taken 11 years manually. The result? Enhanced SEO and customer engagement.

These examples underscore a critical insight: AI's ROI is maximized when paired with purpose-built robotics infrastructure. The Capgemini Research Institute found that enterprises with strong AI readiness achieve ROI 45% faster than peers, with supply chain and finance functions seeing 20–30% cost reductions.

The Investment Opportunity: Where to Allocate Capital

For investors, the robotics-AI nexus offers multiple entry points:

1. Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS): This model democratizes access to automation for SMEs. Companies like ABB and Fanuc are expanding RaaS offerings, enabling scalable, pay-per-use robotics.

2. Sustainability-Driven Robotics: Energy-efficient robots are in high demand as industries meet ESG targets. Startups like Boston Dynamics and traditional players like Fanuc are leading this charge.

3. AI Hardware Specialization: High-performance GPUs and TPUs (e.g., NVIDIA's H100) are essential for real-time AI processing in robotics. The market for such hardware is projected to grow 25% annually through 2030.

Risks and Mitigations

While the potential is vast, challenges remain. Labor displacement fears and regulatory scrutiny could slow adoption. However, the net job creation (12 million globally by 2025) and reskilling initiatives (e.g., Germany's “Industry 4.0” workforce programs) suggest a managed transition. Investors should prioritize companies with robust ESG frameworks and partnerships with educational institutions.

Conclusion: A Strategic Imperative for Investors

Robotics infrastructure is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity for enterprises aiming to stay competitive. By accelerating AI adoption, these investments are driving productivity gains, sustainability, and operational agility. For investors, the message is clear: allocate capital to robotics-AI ecosystems, particularly in RaaS, generative AI applications, and energy-efficient automation.

(HPQ) has emerged as a standout performer in the technology sector, driven by a bold strategic pivot toward AI-driven hardware. The company's Q3 2025 earnings call revealed a compelling narrative of innovation, margin expansion, and market share gains, positioning HP as a leader in the next phase of computing. For investors, the question is no longer whether HP can adapt to AI but how quickly it can capitalize on its first-mover advantages.

Strategic Shift: AI as the Core of HP's Product Roadmap

HP's AI PC (AIPC) strategy has accelerated beyond expectations. AIPCs now account for 25% of the personal systems mix, a full quarter ahead of initial targets. These devices, equipped with NPUs, enable localized AI workloads that enhance productivity, collaboration, and data processing. The 5–10% price premium for AIPCs directly supports margin expansion, a critical factor in a market where traditional PC margins have long been compressed.

Beyond AIPCs, HP is embedding AI into its broader ecosystem. Partnerships with Adobe, Zoom, and Microsoft are unlocking new use cases for AI-driven software on HP hardware. For example, the HP Dimension with Google BIM leverages AI to create 3D video representations for remote collaboration, while HP Neo optimizes print shop workflows. These innovations are not just incremental—they redefine HP's value proposition, shifting the company from a commodity hardware provider to a solutions-driven innovator.

Financials: Margin Resilience and Cost Discipline

HP's Q3 2025 results underscore the financial benefits of its AI strategy. Revenue hit $13.9 billion, up 3.1% year-over-year, with the Personal Systems segment growing 6% as AIPC adoption drove double-digit sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 fell within guidance, while GAAP EPS surged 23.1% to $0.80, reflecting improved operating leverage.

The company's cost discipline is equally impressive. HP is on track to achieve $2 billion in annualized cost savings by fiscal 2025 through AI-powered automation, supply chain optimization, and manufacturing diversification. Nearly all North American products are now built outside China, mitigating trade-related risks and reducing costs. These savings are being reinvested into AI R&D and shareholder returns, with $400 million returned to shareholders in Q3 alone.

Competitive Positioning: Outpacing Peers in AI Adoption

HP's strategic agility is reshaping its competitive landscape. While rivals like Dell and Lenovo focus on traditional PC refresh cycles, HP is capturing market share in premium segments. AIPCs now represent a 25% mix of personal systems, with Adobe and Zoom integrating AI workloads into HP's ecosystem. This creates a flywheel effect: higher margins from AIPCs fund further AI innovation, which in turn strengthens customer loyalty.

The Printing segment, though down 4% year-over-year, is stabilizing through a shift to premium offerings and subscription models. HP's 99% recycled content in printers and 100% renewable electricity in U.S. operations also position it as a sustainability leader, a growing differentiator in ESG-focused markets.

Guidance and Long-Term Outlook

HP's Q4 2025 guidance reinforces its momentum. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range between $0.87 and $0.97, with full-year free cash flow projected at $2.6–3.0 billion. The company anticipates mid-single-digit PC market growth in the second half of fiscal 2025, driven by Windows 11 refresh cycles and AIPC adoption.

Looking further ahead, HP's Investor Day in early 2026 will outline its AI-driven hardware roadmap, including plans to expand AI integration into industrial and enterprise solutions. With a P/E ratio of 10.35 and a free cash flow yield of 10%, HPQ appears undervalued relative to its growth trajectory.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for the AI-First Era

HP's strategic shift to AI-driven hardware is not just a short-term play—it's a structural transformation. The company's ability to monetize AI through premium pricing, operational efficiency, and ecosystem partnerships creates a durable competitive edge. For investors, the key risks include macroeconomic volatility and supply chain disruptions, but HP's cost discipline and diversification mitigate these concerns.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 20:10:36.547416

The Longhorns are starting the season ranked #1 in both the Associated Press and Coaches Poll. Whether or not they can ride that all the way to the College Football Playoffs lies at the feet of their QB1: Arch Manning.

The football world has seen glimpses of Manning in his freshman year at Texas, where he took a backseat to Ohio State transfer Quinn Ewers. Those moments have been bright, stirring optimism among the ardent Longhorns fanbase.

But they're not the only ones betting on Manning this season. Over 1,700 miles away from Austin, eyewear company Warby Parker (WRBY) is placing a bet of their own, banking on who some are calling ""the biggest college quarterback prospect ever"" to bolster sales and attract a new wave of Gen Z consumers.

Kroger shifts investment strategy to boost growth and maximize returns Despite the mounting challenges, Kroger continues to deliver positive financial results.","Following a failed merger with Albertsons and ongoing economic uncertainty in an evolving retail landscape, Kroger is taking further steps to stay competitive, though not without making harsh decisions for the sake of its business.

In an internal memo, Kroger announced it will lay off around 1,000 corporate employees to streamline operations, cut costs, and refocus resources on in-store performance.

The job cuts will primarily impact Kroger's Technology and Digital division. According to a company spokesperson, no employees from in-store positions, manufacturing facilities, or distribution centers will be affected.

Kroger plans to reinvest savings from the layoffs into key areas such as lowering grocery prices, extending store hours, and expanding real estate capabilities to boost store performance and enhance customer experience.

This marks at least the third round of corporate job cuts Kroger has implemented in 2025.

In February, the company eliminated a small number of roles to improve efficiency, followed by layoffs in March at 84.51°, Kroger's retail data science and analytics subsidiary.

In June, Kroger revealed it would close 60 underperforming stores by the end of 2026 to focus on higher-performing locations. Of those, 39 have been named, and at least 18 have closed.

Kroger and Albertsons' failed $24.6 billion merger

This major company restructuring follows the termination of a proposed $24.6 billion merger agreement between Kroger (KR) and Albertsons (ACI) in 2024.

The two grocery giants first announced the deal in 2022, with plans for Kroger to acquire Albertsons to form a national grocery powerhouse. The merger aimed to increase the brands' footprints and allow them to better compete with retail rivals.

However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked the deal, arguing it would reduce competition, raise grocery prices, lower product quality, limit consumer choice, and harm workers.

The case against the merger was further solidified when a Washington state judge ruled it violated state consumer protection laws.

Kroger shifts investment strategy to boost growth and maximize returns

Despite the mounting challenges, Kroger continues to deliver positive financial results. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, total sales increased 3.2% year over year, with e-commerce sales up 15%.

However, recent cost-cutting measures are not a response to declining sales. Instead, they are part of Kroger's strategy to realign its spending to focus on initiatives that offer the highest return.

The speed and scale of China's electric vehicle revolution has caught the world by surprise, and analysts say this trend shows no sign of slowing down.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk was among those whounderestimated the potential of China's EV manufacturers.

In 2011, Musk dismissed BYD by laughing at their products during a Bloomberg interview. ""Have you seen their car?"" Musk said. ""I don't think it's particularly attractive, the technology is not very strong. And BYD as a company has pretty severe problems in their home turf in China. I think their focus is, and rightly should be, on making sure they don't die in China.""

BYD seems to have had the last word. The company has been at the forefront of China's aggressive EV push, rapidly expanding its domestic market and overtaking Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024.

Chinese start-ups such as Nio and Li Auto, alongside more established automakers including Geely and SAIC Motor, are also leading manufacturers in this space. Battery giant CATL has meanwhile been a key player in powering these vehicles.

It's so saturated in China that they have to look elsewhere. And we're at the point now where exports to the rest of the world is only really just starting.

Rella Suskin

Equity analyst at Morningstar

Henner Lehne, vice president of competitive intelligence, market analysis, forecasting at S&P Global Mobility, said China's EV industry has become a ""significant force"" in reshaping the global car market.

""Just a couple years ago the domestic car makers in China were not seen as true competitors to the established global car industry. But that changed quickly within just a couple of years,"" Lehne told CNBC by email.

""BYD alone was growing about 1 [million] units per year for the last three years straight, wiping out the smile in the faces of many product managers from the legacy car makers. And the competition is not only staying in China,"" he added.

Feeling the pressure

Notably, in 2023, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter. It's domestic car sales then ballooned to a record 31.4 million units last year, with brand-new EVs accounting for roughly 41% of the total vehicles produced.

The Asian giant's auto sector growth has been attributed to subsidies, tax incentives and, between 2009 and 2023, an estimated $230 billion in EV development costs. Analysts also cited lower labor costs, the weaker yuan, innovative technological developments and a robust battery supply chain among Beijing's key advantages.

China's ascent has since led to regulatory scrutiny in Western markets, amid allegations of anti-competitive practices. Both the U.S. and European Union have slapped duties on Chinese-made EVs to protect traditionally dominant American and European brands.

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images

Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and a China auto market researcher, said he expects China to cement its dominance in auto manufacturing, ""just as it has done for solar panels. ship-building, drones and steel in recent years.""

By 2030, Dunne told CNBC that he expects China will manufacture 36 million vehicles per year, or four out of every 10 cars built globally at the time. He also anticipates that Beijing will export an estimated 9 million vehicles a year, from just 1 million in 2020.

""Countries with smaller manufacturing industries like Thailand, [South] Africa and Spain are already feeling the pressure from Chinese imports,"" Dunne told CNBC by email.

An industry shake-out?

In the U.K., for one, Chinese EV sales have soared. Chinese-owned car brands accounted for roughly 10% of all new car sales in June, up significantly from previous years.

Chinese EV brands have also rapidly made inroads in EV-friendly Norway. From the first delivery of an MG car to the Nordic country in January 2020, Chinese EV brands have gone on to capture a combined market share of roughly 10%.

watch now

Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, said the growing competitiveness of Chinese vehicles in many parts of the world is only just beginning.

""It's so saturated in China that they have to look elsewhere. And we're at the point now where exports to the rest of the world is only really just starting. We haven't even begun to see the start of it,"" Suskin told CNBC by video call.

In that vein, China's EV industry was recently found to have spent more on factories abroad than at home for the first time on record, during 2024.

The story for Chinese EV players is perhaps not so rosy in their domestic market, however. Analysts told CNBC they expect an industry shake-out before too long, with many startups struggling to turn a profit in an increasingly crowded field.

How can Europe respond?

Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), a car lobby group, described China as a ""fierce competitor"" in the global market.

""I think we as the European auto industry have a legacy of being great competitors as well. So, I certainly wouldn't want to give up on European players, or Japanese, Korean or American for that matter.""

ACEA represents 16 major Europe-based automobile manufacturers, including the likes of Volkswagen , BMW , Stellantis , Renault and Volvo. It has frequently called on the EU to take action to ensure the bloc's competitiveness on the road to full electrification.

To help European carmakers compete with China's EV behemoth, ACEA's de Vries said a leveling of the policy playing field would make a meaningful difference.

""We have to realize that some of that leveling of the ground, speaking for the EU, could be realized on their own terms. It's the regulatory framework, driving cost, stifling innovation rather than unleashing entrepreneurial spirit,"" de Vries said.

ACEA's de Vries added that while Europe won't be able to substantially influence China or the U.S., the bloc's regulatory framework could be adjusted to ""try and create the best possible environment for doing business in Europe.""

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

ID17,CVS Health,2025-08-27 23:11:22+00:00,Metro Weekly,CVS Health Refuses to Cover Cost of Twice-a-Year Injectable PrEP - Metro Weekly,"John Riley, André Hereford",,,,,https://www.metroweekly.com/2025/08/cvs-yeztugo-coverage-denial/,"CVS Health, which runs the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, will not cover Gilead Sciences’ FDA-approved HIV prevention drug Yeztugo, also known as lenacapavir, an injectable form of PrEP shown to be nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission.
Gilead said it is “extremely pleased” with progress in its conversations with payers, most of whom continue to cover HIV prevention products with no cost-sharing or coverage barriers.
The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx, and Cigna’s Express Scripts — control about 70% of U.S. specialty drug prescriptions.
Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, blasted CVS Health’s refusal to cover Yeztugo as a “clear violation” of the Affordable Care Act, which requires preventive treatments, including PrEP, to be offered to patients at no additional cost.
“However, a drug will only work if people can access it, and right now CVS Health, which owns the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, is shamefully blocking people from taking it.”","CVS Health, which runs the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, will not cover Gilead Sciences’ FDA-approved HIV prevention drug Yeztugo, also known as lenacapavir, an injectable form of PrEP shown to be nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission.

CVS spokesman David Whitrap told Reuters the decision was based on “clinical, financial, and regulatory factors,” citing the drug’s high price as a major concern.

Whitrap added that CVS will also exclude Yeztugo from its Affordable Care Act formularies, noting that its ACA preventive program follows recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which guides HHS policy and was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court earlier this summer, currently recommends only three older PrEP drugs: daily oral Truvada (also available as a generic), daily oral Descovy, and Apretude, a bimonthly injectable from ViiV Healthcare.

Some HIV advocates worry that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — known for questioning modern medicine and whose personal beliefs about HIV transmission are not based in science, and border on the bizarre — could replace members of the 16-member task force with ideologically aligned appointees.

Such an overhaul could lead to flawed preventive care guidelines across multiple diseases, higher out-of-pocket costs for patients, and even a rise in new HIV infections.

Mitchell Warren, executive director of the HIV/AIDS nonprofit AVAC, called CVS’s refusal to cover injectable PrEP “a grave disappointment and frankly a missed opportunity.”

“It does reflect a price that is too high and a U.S. pharmaceutical pricing structure that is frankly not sustainable,” Warren said.

Patient advocates had hoped Yeztugo, given twice a year by injection, would not only help prevent the spread of HIV but also reduce reliance on daily oral PrEP, lowering the risk of noncompliance that can undermine effectiveness. They believed the drug could further “bend the curve” and accelerate progress toward ending the HIV epidemic by cutting new infections each year.

HIV infects an estimated 1.3 million people annually and has caused more than 42 million deaths since the virus first emerged.

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Gilead is still negotiating with CVS over Yeztugo, which carries a U.S. list price of more than $28,000 a year.

Gilead said it is “extremely pleased” with progress in its conversations with payers, most of whom continue to cover HIV prevention products with no cost-sharing or coverage barriers. The company said it is on track to secure 75% of U.S. insurer coverage of Yeztugo by year’s end, and 90% coverage by June 2026.

Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, serve as middlemen between drug companies and consumers, negotiating discounts with manufacturers on behalf of employers and health plans. The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx, and Cigna’s Express Scripts — control about 70% of U.S. specialty drug prescriptions.

Optum said it will review Yeztugo for coverage in the coming weeks, while Express Scripts did not respond to requests for comment from news wire services.

Government programs, including the Veterans Administration and Medicare, have already added Yeztugo to their coverage lists. Gilead said earlier this month that Medicaid programs in states such as California and New York are also covering the drug.

Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, blasted CVS Health’s refusal to cover Yeztugo as a “clear violation” of the Affordable Care Act, which requires preventive treatments, including PrEP, to be offered to patients at no additional cost.

“The entire world is excited by this drug and its potential contribution to preventing and eventually ending HIV,” Schmid said in a statement. “However, a drug will only work if people can access it, and right now CVS Health, which owns the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, is shamefully blocking people from taking it.”",https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Injection-Photo-spukkato-via-123rf.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 20:10:29.845870

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Thank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today’s call. Let me start by saying we made solid progress against our goals and key strategic initiatives in Q3. We continue to execute with discipline and focus, delivering on our commitments and advancing our ambition to be a leader in the future of work. Today, we will take a closer look at our third quarter performance, highlight some of our newest innovations and discuss our Q4 outlook. Beginning with our performance, I am pleased to report that we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Q3.

Top line revenue increased 3% year over year, driven by strong performance in Personal Systems. This momentum was fueled by continued Windows 11 refresh, AITC adoption and services growth. We also drove collective double digit growth year over year and sequentially in our key growth areas. Our operating profit margins for both Print and Personal Systems were in line with our guidance. And non GAAP EPS was slightly above the midpoint of our guide, reflecting a sequential improvement of 6%.

These results demonstrate our ability to execute our plan and adapt quickly to the evolving trade environment. We are on track to reach our future ready gross annualized savings of $2,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year twenty twenty five, which we expect will help drive continued improvements in operating profit. At the same time, we are making solid progress on our actions to mitigate higher trade related costs, including manufacturing diversification, cost reduction and pricing adjustments. This quarter as planned, nearly all products sold in North America are now built outside of China, helping to further reduce trade related costs. We continue to ramp up production across Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico and The U.

S. Most importantly, we have done what we said we would. We have demonstrated we can remain agile in responding to external pressures, while staying focused on our long term strategy. Now, let me share more color on the performance of each business unit. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 6% year over year, above our expectations.

We continue to shift our mix to higher value segments such as AIPCs, commercial premium and services. We saw strong year over year growth in both commercial and consumer segments. Commercial performance was supported by the Windows 11 refresh and increased AIPC adoption. We are very pleased with accelerating demand for the AIPC category, which grew revenue double digit sequentially. It has surpassed our expectations with shipments continuing to ramp, now reaching over 25% of our mix, a quarter ahead of our plan.

Consumer growth was supported by a strong back to school season. In our key growth areas, we delivered double digit revenue growth in advanced compute solutions. In services, momentum continued with strong revenue growth year over year, driven mainly by digital services and managed services. Yes, we did see softer demand in hybrid systems as companies are delaying some of their IT projects. Our installed base of active AIPC users is growing significantly and positioning us well for future AI driven innovations.

We are seeing strong momentum in the AIPC ecosystem with a number of software companies introducing solutions growing by double digits quarter over quarter. We are working closely with Microsoft and silicon providers to capture the opportunity created by the AIPC platform. Key ISV partners such as Adobe and Zoom are shifting workloads locally to take advantage of the NPU. We grew share in high value categories, especially in premium segments. This includes year over year and sequential gains in PC commercial premium, consumer premium and AIPCs.

Last quarter, we committed to actions to return our Personal Systems operating margin to its long term target range. I am pleased to report we achieved that delivering an operating margin back into our target range. Turning to Print. Revenue declined 3% in constant currency as expected. Our key growth areas in Print continued to perform well and had strong growth year over year.

While we continue to take actions to mitigate the increase in trade related costs, we saw overall a more aggressive pricing environment. Demand in the office segment was slightly softer than anticipated, particularly across North America and parts of Europe. However, we maintained our share position in office and we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. In Home, we maintained discipline in a competitive pricing environment. Supplies revenue performed as expected.

Diving deeper into our key growth areas, consumer subscriptions had a strong ramp in new subscribers of our all in plan. We had key wins with workforce solutions in industries such as finance, manufacturing, retail and public sector. We saw another quarter of strong growth in Industrial Graphics with share gains year over year reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Now, let’s take a closer look at recent innovations that are positioning us as a leader in the future of work. In Q3, we advanced our portfolio of AI powered solutions that help businesses drive growth and employees achieve professional fulfillment.

On the commercial side, our AI PC lineup received industry recognition. Our ElliBook Ultra was named top AIPC in the CRN Tech Innovator Awards. It was noted for its design, performance and impact on productivity. Our Workforce Experience Platform was recognized in the enterprise IT management category, praised for its ability to reduce digital friction and improve IT efficiency. Since launch, the platform has been deployed in 40 countries and we plan to expand to more than 30 additional countries in the coming months.

We are redefining how people connect and collaborate. We introduced HP Dimension with Google BIM, a video communication tool that uses six cameras and AI to generate three d video of participants designed to enhance remote collaboration. And we are excited to bring advanced AI capabilities to a broader audience with our Omnibook five notebook. For the prosumer, it delivers high performance and up to thirty four hours of battery life, empowering customers to stay productive longer. In our print portfolio, we are integrating AI to drive intelligent automation and customer centric design.

HP Neo, an AI powered chatbot for industrial print, is helping print shops improve production efficiency. In large format, HP Build workspace, an AI vectorization tool, helps architecture, engineering and construction professionals reduced drafting time by up to 80%. Responsible innovation and sustainability are foundational to our future of work efforts and we continue to demonstrate meaningful measurable impact. Today, 9% of HP home and office printers, desktops, notebooks, displays and workstations incorporate recycled content. We have reached 100% renewable electricity across our U.

S. Operations, marking a significant step toward our net zero goal. And in partnership with the YMCA, we’re establishing digital hubs that have already reached over 700,000 people worldwide, helping them succeed in the digital age. In addition, HP is pleased to support the White House initiative to advance AI education for America’s youth. This is an important step toward equipping the next generation with the skills needed to thrive in the future of work.

As we look ahead, we remain confident in the strength of the PC market in 2025. We expect the market to grow mid single digits in the second half with continued strong momentum from Windows 11 refresh and the AITC adoption. We believe these catalysts will continue to drive PC market growth in 2026. We expect the print market to decline low single digit in 2025 and at a similar level in 2026. However, our strategy is focused on protecting the operating profit contribution of the premium business to the company.

We will continue focusing on reducing unprofitable units by shifting to Big Tank, increasing lifetime customer profitability through growth in our consumer subscription business, gaining share in the higher value office categories, growing our key growth areas and maintaining cost discipline. AI is also opening new possibilities to transform how we operate and compete. Beyond driving structural cost reductions, we see tremendous potential to automate additional workflows, streamline decision making and accelerate innovation across the business. These capabilities will help us reduce complexity and drive lower costs. You will hear more about this from us in the quarters ahead.

Extremally, we recognize there is continued uncertainty in the global trade environment. We have planned for today’s landscape and have proven our ability to respond quickly to any future changes. Through our actions, we have strengthened our operational agility and have full confidence in our ability to navigate evolving conditions. As we continue to adapt to this dynamic environment, engagement with investors is a top priority. We are looking forward to sharing our long term plans during our Investor Day in early twenty twenty six.

There, we’ll provide updates on our progress and explore the exciting opportunities ahead to advance our strategy. Before I close, I want to thank our employees for their dedication, resilience and customer first mindset, which have been key to our progress. We know what it takes to deliver results and be a leader in the future of work, and we are executing with focus. Now, let me hand it over to Karen.

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with the progress we’ve made in the quarter to advance our strategy to lead the future of work, while navigating an evolving market environment and delivering on our financial commitments. We drove another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued momentum in Personal Systems, fueled by AIPC and Win eleven refresh activity and strong performance in our key growth areas. In fact, we delivered double digit sequential growth in Personal Systems, resulting in strong free cash flow in the quarter. In Print and PS, we executed decisively on the actions we laid out to mitigate trade related headwinds and are pleased with the meaningful progress we made in the quarter, including accelerating supply chain resiliency, cost reduction and pricing actions.

As a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of tariff costs in Q3, while delivering operating margins within our expected ranges for both businesses and non GAAP EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 3% year over year, both nominally and in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, Americas and EMEA each grew 1%, and APJ was up 11%, with particularly strong personal systems performance in China. Gross margin was 20.5%, down year over year with a higher mix from Personal Systems, increased trade related costs and unfavorable currency impacts.

We offset those headwinds in part with disciplined pricing actions and cost management. As anticipated, non GAAP operating expenses were up year over year. We drove our future ready cost plans and maintained strong expense management, while importantly investing in growth with key strategic and go to market initiatives. All in, our non GAAP operating margin was 7.1%, down year over year and in line with our expectations. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately $954,000,000 shares, our non GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.75 and our GAAP earnings per share was $0.80 helped by favorable tax adjustments in the quarter.

Now let’s turn to segment performance. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of solid growth in Personal Systems, with revenue up 6% above our expectations on 5% unit growth and increased ASPs. We continue to shift mix toward premium categories, while executing disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate cost increases. Sequentially, revenue was up 10 and units were up 13% on seasonal strength and overall share gains. And momentum continued in our key growth areas with strong performance in AIPCs, advanced compute and workforce solutions, offset in part by softness in hybrid systems.

We drove commercial revenue up 5% on 3% unit growth with favorable pricing and a mix shift toward premium. Consistent with our strategy, we gained share in Windows based commercial PCs as refresh activity fueled by Win eleven and AIPCs continued. Consumer revenue and units grew 8% with strong performance in North America along with China driven by gaming. And robust back to school seasonality and share gains drove consumer units up 34% sequentially. Importantly, as promised, we drove Personal Systems operating margin back into our guidance range at 5.4% with our planned mitigation actions.

Turning to Print. Our results reflect a slightly softer than expected office market and a pricing environment that remained competitive despite rising trade related costs across the industry. In this dynamic environment, we maintained our focus on profitable unit placement, prioritization of higher value categories, and disciplined cost management. We also drove strong performance in key growth areas, including double digit growth in consumer subscriptions and strong performance in industrial, fueled by double digit hardware growth. Looking at the details, print revenue declined 4% year over year or 3% in constant currency, with market driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial.

Supplies performed as expected, down 3% in constant currency, and we continued to drive market share gains and favorable pricing that partially offset installed base and usage headwinds. And in line with our guidance, we delivered an operating margin of 17.3%, solidly within our target range and flat year over year as we offset increased trade related costs with pricing actions and cost reductions. Turning to our future ready cost plans. We are pleased with the progress we have made to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across the company. This includes leveraging AI capabilities internally to drive automation and optimization of processes to better support our customers, partners and employees.

We are well on track to hit our total program goal of at least $2,000,000,000 in annualized gross run rate savings by the end of our fiscal year. These incremental structural savings enable our continued investment in our key growth areas and AI innovation, as well as to help us to mitigate macro uncertainties. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated approximately $1,700,000,000 in cash from operations in the quarter and roughly $1,500,000,000 in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. We also improved our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving days payable up with higher manufacturing activity.

Lastly, we returned more than $400,000,000 to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we signaled at the beginning of the quarter, our leverage ratio remained slightly above our target range. So

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: in

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: line with our stated framework, we limited our repurchase to offsetting stock compensation dilution. Of course, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as gross leverage remains under two times and there aren’t better return opportunities. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we will continue to focus on disciplined execution, while maintaining the agility needed to respond to changes in a fluid environment. Our Q4 guide takes into account current global tariff rates, as well as the market growth expectations that Enrique just covered. By segment, in Personal Systems, we expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality, driven by the typical holiday uptick in consumer, continued Windows 11 refresh and AIPC adoption.

And we expect Personal Systems margin to be solidly in our 5% to 7% target range, improving sequentially as the mitigation actions we have taken gained full traction in the quarter. In Print, we also expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality and operating margin to be near the top of our 16 to 19% range, reflecting a higher supplies mix along with disciplined pricing and cost management, offset in part by increased trade related costs. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of 2,600,000,000.0 to $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year twenty twenty five, including approximately $400,000,000 in cash restructuring charges for the year. We expect our non GAAP tax rate to remain consistent with prior periods. Of note, we appreciate the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will help keep our tax rate more consistent and enable continued investment and long term growth opportunities.

With all of this, we expect fourth quarter non GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.97 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85 Looking beyond Q4, we expect continued momentum in the refresh catalysts driving growth in the PC market. And we are confident in the measures we are taking to capitalize on opportunities in the print market and to protect operating profit. I will share more on our fiscal twenty twenty six outlook on our Q4 earnings call. In closing, we delivered solid results in the quarter while executing well against our strategic initiatives. We are confident that the actions we are taking are the right ones to enable us to respond swiftly to near term market dynamics, while continuing to invest for long term profitable growth.

With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question and answer session. And our first questionnaire today will be from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Steven, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. I guess the first one for either Enrique or Karen. I was kind of curious about the tariff related costs in the quarter.

Are you able to help quantify what the total impact was, whether it’s on a dollar basis or maybe in terms of impact to gross margins? And given all the actions you’ve taken, how much are you able to offset as opposed to having to absorb that company?

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Thanks for the question, Stephen. We made meaningful progress in the quarter with our mitigation actions, which included accelerating our supply chain to optimize driving cost reduction and taking pricing actions. And as a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of the tariff costs in Q3, while still delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guide. As we’ve said, we do expect to fully offset these trade related costs as quickly as possible. The full benefit of our mitigating actions, really depending on the scope can take a little bit of time.

But again, we expect to fully mitigate as quickly as we can.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: And I would say we are pleased with the progress we made. As we have said before, this quarter we completed the change of manufacturing and all products going to The U. S. Or the great majority of products going to The U. S.

Are not built in China anymore. We also drove additional cost actions and we do indeed selective price increases. Overall, we made good progress and this is why we are confident in ability to mitigate tariffs down the road as we will continue to execute on these plans.

Steven, Analyst, TD Cowen: Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up, one question on the Print business. I guess anecdotally just given the number of large, I guess enterprises around the world that have announced return to office initiatives so far this year. I guess I’m a little surprised that there weren’t any improvements to the outlook for the print business.

I guess can you talk about any expectations perhaps going into fiscal twenty twenty six on some of these return to office initiatives if that might have a delayed growth impact into next year perhaps or is there some different dynamic about return to office initiatives in terms of spending on supplies and commercial hardware? Thank you so much.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. Thank you. I think there are two dynamics that we need to have in mind. First of all, from an investment perspective, we are seeing enterprise and commercial businesses prioritizing other areas above print. For example, investments in AI or even investments in PCs.

So we think that this has impacted in the short term the sales of print hardware in the office side. On the other side, when we look at pages printed, and as you know, this is the most fundamental variable to understand the health of the business going forward. We have not seen a deviation versus our plan, which means that down the road, we will see the demand for printers come back because customers continue to print and there has not been a deviation there, which is in line with the return of the office assumptions that we were making. So short term impact on the hardware, but not impact on supplies, which means in the long term, the business will come back as companies will have to build new hardware to complete or to make sure that the employees are having the right experience.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Urban Lu, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Urban Lu calling in for Amit. It’s great to see your momentum in your AIPC product category. I think the sequential 25 growth was rather notable.

But can you help us understand whether AIPCs carry a higher ASP or margin profile versus non AIPCs?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. So let me confirm that we are very pleased with the growth that we are seeing in AIPCs and not only of the category by itself, but also of how the ecosystem is being developed because eventually the demand for AIPCs is going to be driven by applications and we are seeing more and more applications taking advantage of the new capabilities that AIPCs have. In terms of pricing, we can confirm the estimations that we had before. We are seeing an uplift in pricing of AIPCs compared to similar units that are not that don’t bring this capability. And we maintain the assumptions that we had shared before of the 10% to the 5% to 10% price increase driven by AIPCs.

Urban Lu, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Got it. And then I have one for Karen as well. As I look at your Q4 EPS guidance, I think the sequential or seasonal increase in EPS for Q4 is at $0.17 at the midpoint and it’s higher than what we’ve historically seen. I’m just kind of curious whether this is going to be driven by any sort of margin benefit from your ReadyNEXT program?

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Erwin. We are seeing good momentum heading into fourth quarter. And in PS, we do expect sequential revenue growth in line with the prior year seasonality. And that’s really driven by the continued momentum in the Win 11 refresh and AIPC adoption, as well as we’ve got the holiday uptick in consumer that we expect to happen strongly.

I’d say more importantly though, we do expect the PSOP rate to continue to improve as we continue to work to offset the headwinds of trade related costs and commodity costs. And in Print, we also expect sequential revenue growth in line with prior year seasonality and sequential OP improvement to the top of our 16% to 19% target range, and that’s really driven by seasonally higher Supplies volume. So we’re confident in our Q4 guide.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: To complement that, we also will see a bigger impact of some of the actions we took around tariffs. Some of the new tariffs were put in place at the end of last quarter, beginning of this quarter. And this we will continue to mitigate as time goes.

Urban Lu, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Understood. Thank you for the color.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of David Voigt with UBS. Please go ahead.

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So maybe

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: we go back to

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: the PC market because I think Aaron you mentioned you expect normal seasonality in the PC market. And I guess what I’m struggling with a little bit is you’ve had incredibly strong growth the last two quarters. And if I think about your business over the years, generally speaking, you don’t have that degree of strength for, call it, three quarters in a row sequentially. Can you just maybe expand upon what gives you confidence in this guide? And I think you also mentioned strength in, I guess, momentum into next year.

And I know you mentioned ARPC and obviously some other Windows 11 refresh dynamics, but a little bit more color there would help. And I’ll give you my second question at the same time. And so maybe just help us understand kind of the margin dynamics within print a little bit better. I know last quarter you had the grant this quarter, obviously mix and some pricing dynamics probably hurt margins. Can you maybe walk us through kind of what’s going to reverse a little bit in the October to help get us back towards the upper bound of that range from a print perspective?

Thanks.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Okay. So let me take the first question and Kieran will take the second question. In terms of PC demand, I think there are different things to have in mind. First of all, Q4 versus Q3, in the consumer side, there is always an increase of demand driven by completing the back to school cycle and also preparing for holidays. And this always drives a sequential improvement.

In the commercial side, we expect to continue to see two major drivers of growth. One is the Windows 11 refresh and second is the IPCs. In Windows 11 year on year and quarter on quarter, we see an improvement in the funnel, meaning the funnel at the beginning of Q4 is higher than it was at the beginning of Q3 and also bigger than what it was at the beginning of Q4 last year. And Windows 11 is playing a key role there. Second, what is also very important to assess long term sales, when we look at where are we in the cycle, our estimate is that slightly more than 50% of the installed base has been converted to Windows 11, which means there is still going to be a positive impact not only in Q4, but also in the earlier quarters of next year.

And this is why we’ve seen the demand for PCs is going to continue in Q4. We projected that the growth of PCs will be mid single digits for the second half and that there will be growth in fiscal year twenty twenty six.

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: And on the margins, we’re confident in our sequential improvement in print margins. In our Q3 print operating margin at 17.3% was solidly within our guidance range and in line with our expectations. You know, we typically have lower supply sales in the summer months and that, you know, that can cause some seasonal seasonality in the margins. But as we look into Q4, we do expect the print margins to be at the top end of our range, and that’s reflecting some higher supplies volumes as we saw very similar to last year, along with disciplined pricing and cost management. I know you also mentioned the grant last quarter.

We did see a grant last quarter from the EDB that had a bit of a catch up from the beginning of the calendar year to be booked in the quarter, but it is a multiyear grant and we are continuing to receive that grant this fiscal year and into future fiscal years.

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Thanks, Karen.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan, Analyst, Bank of America: Yes. Thank you so much. I guess, Enrique or Karen, I don’t I know you spoke up quite a bit color on print margins just now, but I normally don’t think of print margins to be that volatile, but you just dropped 200 plus basis points on print margin sequentially and it’s going to bounce back next quarter. And Enrique, you made some comments on sort of where you’re emphasizing and deemphasizing certain parts of the portfolio as well. So if you were to pull those together and we think and we fast forward beyond sort of fiscal 4Q, are you thinking that the range for these print margins is sort of going to be in this long term range that you’ve given because you seem to be tracking at the higher end, even above the higher end in quite a few quarters.

And given some of the cost actions that you’re taking, should we just be calibrating towards a higher range for print margins?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: So let me a couple of comments. First, in terms of the changes quarter over quarter, what we have seen this year is very similar to what we saw last year. As Kare mentioned before, the biggest impact in Q3 was driven by the mix of supplies that was lower compared to Q2 and is lower compared to what we expect to see in Q4. And this really has a big impact. But again, we saw very similar performance a year ago.

So I don’t we don’t think it’s out of what we have seen in previous cases. In terms of the projections long term, we are not changing our projections from what we have been seeing before. We continue to maintain the ranges that we have seen. As we have said before, having these ranges gives us the opportunity in a given country in a given quarter to be more aggressive placing units. If this is what we decide to do because we see that they will be profitable units, we have done this in the past and we want to have the ability to do that without getting out of the ranges that we have.

In terms of the actions that we’re taking for the print business going forward, they are very consistent with conversations we have had in the past one, two. We are going to continue to drive in the consumer space, a shift to more profitable units, especially big tank. We are going to continue to drive improvements to capture more lifetime customer profitability by shifting the business to subscriptions and services. We see opportunities to grow share in profitable office categories and we see an opportunity to drive growth in the industrial side that we have done in that we have driven in the past and we will continue to do. And of course, we are going to be very disciplined managing our cost structure and looking for any opportunity we have to improve productivity and increase efficiency.

So it’s very consistent with the plan that you have seen us executing before and we will continue to do that going forward.

Wamsi Mohan, Analyst, Bank of America: Okay. Thanks, Enrique. And if I have a follow-up just on PCs. If you look at industry expectations, there is below normal seasonality based on whether it be ODM builds or other things that the industry third parties that we can look at below normal seasonal trends in the back half of this year and then even projections for a decline. You’re kind of saying something very different, which is sequentially consistent with prior years and then growth next year.

So is the implication here that HP is taking share? And if you are, where is that coming from? Any particular regions, any particular players? And where is that success may be coming from?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: There are two comments. One is our projections are consistent to what we are seeing in the market. And we have seen strong commercial demand in Q3. We have seen strong consumer demand. And as I mentioned before, we don’t think this is a pull in of demand.

We think this is real demand, because it’s not only happening in The U. S, we are seeing this across multiple countries and across multiple geographies. In terms of our projections going forward, they rely on the fact that we continue to see strong demand for AI PCs, strong demand for Windows 11. And something I didn’t mention before is also the fact that we expect ASPs to continue to grow because of demand stronger demand and stronger growth in premium categories, which has been our strategy in the previous quarters and will continue to be going forward. So answering your question on share, you know that our goal and our objective is not to grow share for the sake of gaining share, is to drive profitable growth.

What we have been doing in the last quarters is growing share in the more premium segment of commercial, consumer, AIPCs and this is going to continue to be our strategy going forward.

Wamsi Mohan, Analyst, Bank of America: Okay. Thanks, Enrique.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michael Ng, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you. I just have two as well. One for Enrique on Print and one for Karen just on capital allocation. Enrique on Print, you guys have talked a little bit about the more aggressive pricing environment, the demand in office softer than expected in North America and Europe.

As you look out to the rest of this year and into next, I was wondering if you could just talk about your expectation on those two things, pricing and the office environment, and whether you see that becoming better or worse in the next couple of months in the next year or so? And then, Karen, I just wanted to ask for a clarification. Are we at the point, from the gross leverage standpoint, I think you guys are below 2% now where you guys will return 100 of free cash flow to shareholders as soon as next quarter. And I just wanted to ask if you could clarify, when you guys talked about the revenue guidance for the segments, was that consistent with prior years or typical years? I feel like you may have said both.

I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Let me start on the question on pre in demand. So at this point, what we are expecting or what we are building in the plant is similar market behavior to what we have seen in Q3. If many of our competitors announced price increases as a consequence of the trade related costs. What we have seen in the market is that these price increases didn’t materialize in the competitive space. So we are expecting that this aggressive price competition is going to continue going forward.

We think it’s connected to the fact that the market was smaller and therefore there was in the market more pressure on the price side. But as I said before, we think this is going to be temporary. We have not seen a change in the fundamental variable, which is the number of pages printed, which gives us confidence on the future. And in terms of 2026, it’s early to give you a lot of detail. We will in the coming quarters, in the coming months as we do more work to estimate what will be the demand on for next year.

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. And Michael on your second question on capital allocation, our leverage did improve from Q2 where it was slightly over 2.2 times and improved in Q3 to just be slightly over two times, the 2.04 in Q3. And that was driven by improved EBITDA and the repayment of a debt maturity that we had in June. While it could remain slightly elevated in Q4, we do expect it to continue to improve in FY 2026. So we do anticipate more repurchase activity soon.

And I would say, should we continue to operate at higher leverage levels, we would use cash to reduce debt as bonds mature and that would also enable us to repurchase stock as well.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Maya, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. This is Maya on for Eric. Enrique, maybe if we start with you, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on your AIPC comments? When we speak to CIOs or channel partners, we don’t hear as much enthusiasm for AIPCs, but clearly your comments prove otherwise. Can you just please unpack maybe the industries you see adopting AIPCs or regions that are particularly strong?

And then what are the key use cases you’re hearing that are driving this AIPC adoption? Then I have

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: a Sure. Follow-up. Yes.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: And I think it’s really my comments are driven by what we see in actuals. As I said in the prepared remarks, our mix of AIPCs today is more than 25%. And this is the goal that we had for Q4 for the end of the year. So we are one quarter ahead of our original target, which shows the demand that we see. I think the key thing behind AIPCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that AIPCs have.

And we have started to see it now and we expect that it will continue. For example, we have now Adobe and Zoom that are taking advantage of the capabilities of running some of their application software in their PCs, which means it will be faster and also it will reduce some of the cloud costs that they will be having. We have seen security companies like CrowdStrike taking advantage of the ability to use in the MPUs to scan the memory faster, which means for many of their applications this brings a significant advantage. Also Microsoft is doing a remarkable job continuing to improve the libraries that they offer to other companies, so they can do a lot of activities in the PCs that before they had to do in the cloud. And finally, of our own AI applications, during the last months, we launched AI companion, OMEN AI.

We launched a specific AI application in China. We continue to see month over month and quarter over quarter improvements in utilization. So we see clearly a gradual improvement. And as we said to many of our customers, if you are driving a refresh of your installed base and IPC you expect to leave two, three, four years and you expect your employees to use it for this time. If you don’t want to be left out of the productivity improvements that over time are going to come, you should be considering buying an AIPC now and this is what we see happening.

Maya, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. And then I know you mentioned that we’re a little over 50% of the way through Windows 11 refresh. If we think about the SMB category, do you see them adopting more of that twelve month extended support that could come back and refresh in 2026? Or kind of how do the trends differ by underlying customer

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: segments?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. I think it’s a great question. So first of all, when we look at the total conversion, we are behind what we have been other years sorry, in previous refreshes,

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: which

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: is why we think this process is going to be extended. When we look at the penetration in enterprise versus SMB, and this is very consistent to what we have seen before, the changes starting enterprise and over time it takes in SMB. This is what is happening this year, which is very consistent with preview refreshes. So we have we see a bigger opportunity in SMB going forward, which again is very consistent with previous refreshes that happened before.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alec Valero with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Hey guys, this is Alec on for Ananda. Thank you for taking my questions. Just very quickly on the Poly business, is there anything that you could update us on? Are you seeing any noticeable pickup or increased certainty in enterprise and corporate spending?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Thank you. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that this was not a strong quarter for what we call hybrid systems. We have seen companies, especially in Europe, especially in the headset space, de prioritizing some of these projects versus PCs or versus AI. So we have seen an impact in the short term. We continue to think that this is going to be or this is a very important business for us going forward.

And we continue to invest not only on the headset space, also in the video side. We announced a very innovative solution on the video collaboration that we did with Google and we are going to continue to invest in this category. On the other side, on the gaming side, in similar categories, we have seen very strong growth this quarter. This is driven by HyperX. So on that side of the peripheral space, we had a strong quarter.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. As part of your refresh initiative, is there any specific product lines that you are eyeing to refresh?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Is the question on PCs or is it really across the full portfolio?

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Yes, just across the full portfolio.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: I mean, the answer is yes, across the board. We continue to invest very significantly in R and D. Innovation is a key part of how we win and how do we compete. And next year, there will be refreshes across the PC portfolio, both in the consumer side, in the commercial side, in the workstation space and many of the key areas of printing. Of innovation that is coming.

We mentioned a bit of that of what we did in Q3, but the next quarters are going to be very exciting from an innovation perspective.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Super helpful. Thank you, guys.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: I think it was the last question. So in closing, let me reiterate a few of the key points that we have been making. First of all, we are executing with discipline in an environment that continues to be dynamic. Second, we expect to continue to see momentum in the refreshed catalyst driving growth in the PC market. As I just mentioned, we are innovating to be a leader in the future of work and we remain very energized by the opportunities that we see ahead.

And before we wrap the call, I want to share that Dorit will be moving to a new role as my new Chief of Staff. And I want to use this opportunity to thank her for her leadership as Global Head of IR. Her financial insight, sound judgment and guidance have been invaluable to HP, to me and to Karen, and we look forward to her continued strong contribution in her next role. I am also pleased to welcome Alok Yuyao, our new Global Head of IR, With more than a decade at HP, including his recent role as CFO of our Personal Systems business, Alok brings deep expertise and a clear understanding of our operations. And he is very well positioned to support our investor relationships and contribute to HP’s long term goals.

So thank you to both, and thank you to all of you for attending today’s call. Thank you.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

In Nigeria, Ghana and beyond, this is where cultural power meets commercial impact — and where brands can help shape the future of marketing across the continent.","Influencer marketing is surging worldwide, but Africa is rewriting the rules. With over 1.1 billion people and a median age under twenty, it is the fastest growing digital market on the planet. The African creator economy is projected to reach US $17.84 billion by 2030, rising at an annual rate of 28.5 per cent.

Nigeria and Ghana are now at the forefront, joining the dentsu School of Influence, a programme founded in South Africa and later launched in Spain and Kenya, designed to train and empower creators who connect deeply with local communities, cultures and languages.

“With Nigeria at the forefront of dentsu’s Influencer Movement, we are unlocking a new era of storytelling powered by authenticity and community. In Africa, influence is not about celebrity alone, it is about cultural resonance — and Nigerian creators are already proving that they can shape conversations, shift perceptions, and drive impact at scale,” said Emeka Chris Okeke, Group Executive Chairman & CEO, MediaFuse-Dentsu Nigeria

Okeke emphasized that the programme is timely, given Nigeria’s young, mobile-first population and thriving creator economy. He noted that the dentsu School of Influence will not only elevate the voices of Nigerian creators but also provide them with tools for long-term success — from monetisation and brand partnerships to data literacy and community building. He added that this initiative reflects dentsu’s broader commitment to innovating to impact by equipping the next generation of African storytellers to compete and thrive on the global stage.

Speaking on the initiative, Marian Ogaziechi, Managing Director of Dentsu Agyle, who has led successful influencer marketing projects in Nigeria, expressed her delight that dentsu is formalizing and scaling the fast-growing creator economy in Africa. “Influencer marketing in Nigeria is evolving rapidly, from one-off collaborations to structured, insight-led partnerships that deliver measurable impact,” she said.

She added that through the School of Influence, dentsu will equip creators with global best practices, data-driven insights, a clear understanding of the global landscape, and the structure they need to thrive. “This initiative is not just about brand campaigns; it is about building an ecosystem where Nigerian voices can lead conversations locally and globally.”

An Influencer Landscape Like No Other

In Africa, influence is built on authenticity, community relevance and trust. Success depends less on celebrity status and more on cultural resonance and local storytelling. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and X dominate in Nigeria and Ghana, but impact comes from content rooted in diverse languages and lived experiences, from Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa in Nigeria to Twi, Ewe and Ga in Ghana.

The Power of Gen Z

Nigeria and Ghana have some of the youngest populations globally, with median ages of 18 and 21. These mobile first generations value economic empowerment, social mobility and community recognition. They are prolific creators and consumers, shaping trends that travel far beyond their borders.

According to dentsu Africa, 72 per cent of African Gen Zs trust brands more when influencers come from their own communities, favouring relatability over aspiration alone. Nigerians spend an average of 3 hours 41 minutes daily on social platforms, with Ghanaian usage similarly high.

Why the dentsu School of Influence Matters

The programme develops skills beyond content creation, covering brand partnerships, monetisation, data literacy and community building. It addresses challenges such as brand safety, ROI measurement and the underrepresentation of grassroots voices.

Results are proven. In Kenya, programme-trained influencers outperform standard campaigns by about 60 per cent. In South Africa, the uplift is 17 per cent. The talent pool in Africa is already rich:

Nigeria: Charity Ekezie, 3.4 million TikTok followers, 86 million likes, using humour to dismantle stereotypes.

Ghana: Wode Maya, 1.73 million YouTube subscribers, 274 million views, telling authentic African stories.

South Africa: Seemah, 2.7 million followers, 206 million likes, blending beauty, fashion and comedy.

A Data Led, Hyperlocal Approach

Using proprietary platforms such as Merkury and CCS, dentsu Africa profiles millions of consumers to design culturally intelligent, community-first campaigns. A YouTube campaign in Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Twi, Ewe and Ga delivered a 9.6 per cent lift in brand recall in Nigeria and 6.5 per cent in South Africa.

The Opportunity for Brands

South Africa’s influencer market is valued at over US $115 million, growing 13 to 15 per cent annually. Across Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, influencers range from macro stars to nano community leaders, with cultural corridors linking Lagos, Accra and Johannesburg offering regional scale.

Shaping the Next Chapter of Influence

The dentsu School of Influence is more than a training ground. It is a catalyst for a new era of African storytelling, led by creators who speak the languages, live the cultures and understand the communities they represent. By combining hyperlocal insight with global expertise, dentsu is building the infrastructure that will define influence for the next decade. In Nigeria, Ghana and beyond, this is where cultural power meets commercial impact — and where brands can help shape the future of marketing across the continent.

The AG's office sued CVS in April, claiming that CVS offered lower prices at its pharmacies for cash-pay patients through an outside discount program administered by ScriptSave, but did not report those prices to MassHealth.
“When pharmacies overcharge MassHealth, they’re undermining the integrity of our public programs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” Campbell said in a statement.
A spokesperson for CVS told Fierce Healthcare that the company is ""pleased"" to resolve the matter and noted that the settlement only relates to that MFN regulation.
""In the cases involving CVS, we’ve prevailed many times, including by court dismissal, jury verdict and arbitrator award,"" the spokesperson said.","CVS has agreed to a $12.25 million settlement with Massachusetts that resolves allegations that it charged members of its Medicaid program more for prescription drugs than they charged the general public.

In addition to the funds in the settlement, CVS agreed to an annual reconciliation process where they will make sure that prices charged to MassHealth members are on par with others to avoid future overcharges, according to an announcement from Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell.

The AG's office sued CVS in April, claiming that CVS offered lower prices at its pharmacies for cash-pay patients through an outside discount program administered by ScriptSave, but did not report those prices to MassHealth.

The suit was filed jointly by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana and Oklahoma.

“When pharmacies overcharge MassHealth, they’re undermining the integrity of our public programs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” Campbell said in a statement. “I am proud to announce this settlement, which will prevent future inaccurate price reporting and ensure MassHealth has the resources it needs to continue serving Massachusetts residents.”

MassHealth has a unique ""most favored nation"" policy in place that requires the lowest drug prices to be charged within the program. A spokesperson for CVS told Fierce Healthcare that the company is ""pleased"" to resolve the matter and noted that the settlement only relates to that MFN regulation.

The spokesperson added that the settlement is not an admission of guilt.

""We’ll continue vigorously defending against the claims concerning CVS Pharmacy’s usual and customary pricing brought by remaining plaintiffs in the case,"" they said. ""For the last several years, many pharmacies, including CVS Pharmacy, have been named as defendants in other U&C lawsuits accusing the pharmacies of having submitted inflated U&C prices.""

""In the cases involving CVS, we’ve prevailed many times, including by court dismissal, jury verdict and arbitrator award,"" the spokesperson said.

On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Michigan House passed its first version of a government budget, which features widespread cuts impacting all levels of education.
""I can't just uproot my children into a different state because we don't have a budget.","Michelle Johnson is hard at work, restocking supplies to get her classroom ready for the first day of school.

""Every single teacher in this building, every single teacher, purchases things, and it's because we want as much as we can for our students,"" said Johnson.

Just down the hall, fellow fifth-grade teacher Julie Lapinski is finalizing her lesson plans, with one major task looming on her mind.

""If the funding gets cut, and the district has to make cuts, unfortunately, those instructional aides might be the ones that have to go,"" said Lapinski.

Classroom aides, supplies and free meals are just some of the essentials teachers and parents rely on at Jefferson Elementary School in Wyandotte, Michigan, one of the many schools concerned about the progress of the state budget.

""It not only supplies just us parents as having our children get an education, but it also has employment for our teachers to be able to educate our children,"" said parent Karen Briones.

On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Michigan House passed its first version of a government budget, which features widespread cuts impacting all levels of education. Hours later, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer met with Johnson and Lapinski to learn how their preparations were going and what comes next in Lansing.

""It's not a budget that is going to get signed into law, but they did their part, and now it is time for us to have serious and fast negotiations, to have a budget that really reflects the needs of the people of the state,"" said Whitmer.

For Briones, Jefferson Elementary's community is special. A former alum herself, two of her children called the school home, and she says seeing the budget fight makes her anxious for the year ahead.

""I can't just uproot my children into a different state because we don't have a budget. So, that's where our future is. It's a little scary,"" said Briones.

Both Lapinski and Johnson encourage legislators to look past their party and focus on who they serve.

""Stop looking at the numbers. Stop pushing numbers. Think about the children,"" said Lapinski.

""If we keep kids and families at the center of our focus and not think about anything else, everybody knows what the right thing is to do. Everybody,"" said Johnson.

“We believe cocoa prices will remain high for another three-plus years,” says Stefan Bucher, senior principal scientist.
“All of the solutions are similar in the sense that they are composed cocoa/chocolate flavors that are designed to supplement up to a 30% reduction of cocoa powder in different applications.

While they have moderated a bit since, the commodity still is trading above $8,000 – and that has food processors looking for alternatives.

“Cocoa market prices remain high due to low stock levels and a large supply deficit observed over the last few years,” French supplier Prova said in its August 2025 market report. “The ICCO [International Cocoa Organization] recently updated the figures for the 2023/2024 season [when] global cocoa production fell by 12.9% to 4,368 million metric tons, with a supply deficit revised upwards of 494,000 tons, much higher than the figure observed in previous shortfall years.

“However, for 2024/2025, the ICCO is forecasting surplus supply, with the harvest expected to be better than the previous year due to improved weather conditions,” the Prova report continued. “Despite this, production will still fall short of 2022/2023 levels. The start of the intermediate harvest (April to September) has however been disappointing, with a lower bean quality resulting in a lower butter and powder yield.”

So while cocoa’s prospects are improving, it will take a while for the beans to mature and be harvested, the ingredient to be processed and prices to come down.

Hershey Co. in July confirmed it’s raising prices on its chocolate candies by ""low double-digit"" percentages, with most price hikes coming in the fall. In some cases, pack sizes will get smaller; in others, list prices will rise. “This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,” a Hershey spokesperson told us. “It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.”

Hershey is not alone. Also in July, Swiss chocolatier Lindt acknowledged it already has increased prices by 15.8% in the first half of this year. Nestle’s financial reports have included references to price hikes. While Mondelez has been quietly working them in over the past year, the company is cautiously optimistic about the cocoa price outlook, citing improving market fundamentals and a promising West African pod count.

Cocoa is a complex flavor, and it’s also familiar to almost all consumers, so replacing it is tricky. Ardent Mills and Prova introduced solutions at the July IFT FIRST food ingredients show.

Wheat is the main ingredient in Ardent Mills’ (www.ardentmills.com) Cocoa Replace, the toasting process providing most of the sensory (both flavor and color) attributes of cocoa. Based on U.S.-sourced wheat, it not only provides a cost savings but also a stable, domestic supply.

By replacing up to 25% of the cocoa powder in standard formulations, Cocoa Replace can provide significant cost savings. It also lowers the fat content of the final product, since cocoa powder typically has 10-12% fat.

Ardent Mills sampled a devil’s food cupcake at the IFT show with a quarter of its cocoa substituted with Cocoa Replace. As a single-ingredient solution, it simplifies reformulation and keeps label changes to a minimum, especially in chocolate products already based on wheat.

“We believe cocoa prices will remain high for another three-plus years,” says Stefan Bucher, senior principal scientist. Ardent Mills focuses on mostly bakery applications, and the firm showed prototypes at the IFT show for cakes, muffins, brownies, cookies, pancakes & waffles, quick bread and pumpernickel bread.

Prova, too, showed cocoa substitutes at the show. “We put together a toolbox that included flavor samples and their respective usage rates and organoleptic sensory charts,” says Justin Demers, director of applications and product development for Prova (provaus.com). “We've validated these flavors specifically for compound companies to reduce up to 30% cocoa in their products.”

Protec is the name for all of Prova’s technical solutions; Cocoa Reduction Flavor Solutions are within that. “All cocoa powder/solids have unique flavor profiles,” Demers continues. “We create tailormade solutions for our customers, but this box shows a selection of what types of profiles we can target, even with off-the-shelf options.”

Prova’s applications focus on baked goods, sweet confections, beverages and dairy-based creations. “All of the solutions are similar in the sense that they are composed cocoa/chocolate flavors that are designed to supplement up to a 30% reduction of cocoa powder in different applications. There is no single key ingredient, and they all have unique cocoa/chocolate flavor profiles. They are formulated with the specific solubility and processing tolerance of each application in mind.”

A year ago, Planet A Foods (planet-a-foods.com), based in Germany, was using sunflower seeds and oats as main ingredients for its ChoViva cocoa replacers. But this year, “We’ve updated our recipes and are using sunflower seeds and grape seed flour as main ingredients,” says Marketing Manager Jessica Karch.

The company began developing its solution in 2021, before the current cocoa price spikes. So reducing the cost was not the company founders’ intention -- they learned that demand for cocoa was causing mass deforestation, exacerbated by climate change, so they set out to create chocolate without cocoa.

“Planet A Foods isn’t just about ChoViva — we’re an ingredients company working to de-risk global supply chains by developing alternatives for endangered ingredients,” Karch explains. “Our overall vision is to save 500 million tons of carbon dioxide per year.”

ChoViva has not made it into the U.S. market yet, but it’s currently an ingredient in chocolate-flavored cookies, peanut butter cups and cereal found on German and Austrian grocery store shelves – altogether, it’s in approximately 70 products in nine countries worldwide. A launch in the U.S. has been a goal. “It’s on our list, and we’re already in talks with several partners,” says Karch. A cocoa butter alternative also is in development.

Two ubiquitous technologies are teaming up to help. NotCo (tech.notco.com), the Chilean food tech company in which Kraft Heinz has an investment, says its Giuseppe AI platform can create customized cocoa-free chocolate alternatives that mimic the taste, texture, and melt of traditional chocolate without relying on the strained cocoa supply chain. Using precision fermentation, the NotCo team optimized a blend of upcycled ingredients and sustainable crops to craft an alternative that resembles real cocoa flavor.","https://img.foodprocessing.com/files/base/ebm/foodprocessing/image/2025/08/68af6f390a189d7e2386a6e7-choviva_bar_source__planet_a_foods_photographer__d.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-27 18:13:58.316066

AL’s Real Goods Chewy Cookies

AL’s Real Goods enters the crowded cookie aisle with a trio of chewy, indulgent options: Choco Chip, Ginger Smack, and Choco Choco. Each variety comes packed in bright, 6.7 oz boxes that emphasize handmade charm with a premium twist. Developed by a former Michelin starred chef, these non-GMO verified cookies aim to elevate the packaged cookie experience by emphasizing real ingredients like butter and unpretentious/classic flavor profiles that still feel chef-crafted.

Things that stand out:

As far as packaged cookies go, AL’s is truly top-notch and we’d be hard pressed to think of a brand that does chewy cookies better. It’s definitely an elevated experience across all three flavors.

Packaging is eye-catching and effective — bold typography, pastel tones, and large cookie visuals make for strong shelf appeal.

The SKU choices evoke nostalgia vibes and are very straightforward. There should be near-zero consumer education required, which allows AL’s to focus on being a super premium player.

The use of real butter and a focus on clean-label cues (e.g., non-GMO) sets these apart from typical mass-market chewy cookies.

Things to consider:

While the flavor and texture are standout for a shelf-stable cookie, the inclusion of preservation-friendly ingredients (necessary for this format) slightly undermines the “Michelin” positioning. Not sure that there is really a way around this, but worth noting nonetheless.

Price point will likely reflect the premium branding, which may limit its appeal to more ingredient-conscious or gourmet-inclined consumers.

Minor point, but “Choco Chip” and “Choco Choco” could benefit from more name differentiation.

New Primal Rotisserie Chicken

Fresh off a big growth year, New Primal unveiled a bold rebrand and shortened name to stand out in the red-hot meat stick segment. The brand also debuted a Rotisserie Seasoned Chicken offering, leaning further into poultry in a category largely dominated by beef. Combining the convenience of a meat stick with the flavors of a classic comfort food, this latest addition carves a new space in an increasingly crowded set.

Things that stand out:

A relatively high-protein option, with 10 grams of protein, 60 calories and zero sugar per 1 oz. stick.

Crafted with simple ingredients, including all-natural chicken raised without added hormones or antibiotics, plus sea salt, celery powder, black pepper, garlic, onion, cherry, coriander, parsley flakes and ground nutmeg.

The product is free of the top eight allergens and Whole30 Approved.

Things to consider:

Priced at $11.99 for a 5-count bag and $39.99 for a 20-count carton, each unit shakes out to roughly two bucks per pop – on par with other premium meat sticks but could be a tough sell for the conventional crowd.

While full of flavor, these sticks aren’t as tender and juicy as other chicken-based meat snacks (that are typically packed with unwanted additives).

Rating:

NOVOS Longevity Bar

Increasing lifespan and improving healthspan have been hallmarks of the wellness community for a while that are now making their way deeper into more conventional packaged food formulations. Supplement maker NOVOS Labs has been operating in the space since 2018, recently launching a Longevity Nutrition Bar line (Salted Chocolate Crunch, Mixed Berry Crunch and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Crunch) to bring the brand into more retail locations.

Things that stand out:

The familiar protein bar texture has the added benefit of crunchy pea protein crisps that give it a nice bite.

Callouts to skin health, mind and mood, metabolism and lean muscle add to the differentiated positioning as a longevity product.

Subtle but straightforward branding provides shoppers with an understandable value proposition.

Things to consider:

More flavor variation with a touch of healthy indulgence like chocolate coating could help with the taste. Salted Chocolate Crunch had a bitter aftertaste. Mixed Berry was our favorite.

While not overly dry or chalky, some formulation tweaks to improve texture would help the eating experience.

The nutritional panel is packed with over 20 ingredients which could be tightened to focus on key functional inclusions. Four different mushroom varieties might not be necessary, and most consumers are unfamiliar with astaxanthin.",https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27171546/Nosh-Reviews-NP-Novos-Als_OG-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 18:14:17.045839

Earnings, excluding some items, will be 87 cents to 97 cents a share in the period ending in October, the maker of computers and printers said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated 91 cents.

In the fiscal third-quarter ended July 31, HP reported sales climbed 3.1% to $13.9 billion. Profit, excluding some items, was 75 cents a share. Analysts, on average, projected adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents on revenue of $13.7 billion.

To cope with the effects of tariffs, HP has adjusted to use manufacturing facilities outside of China for almost all of its products sold in North America, and the company has increased some prices, Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said in an interview.

The company was able “mitigate the majority of the tariff costs in Q3, while still delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guide,” Chief Financial Officer Karen Parkhill said in response to analysts’ questions during a conference call after the results were released. “As we’ve said, we do expect to fully offset these trade-related costs as quickly as possible. And the full benefit of our mitigating actions really depending on the scope can take a little bit of time. But again, we expect to fully mitigate as quickly as we can.”

In the fiscal third quarter, sales of PCs rose 6% and the company expects “mid-single digit” growth to continue in the current period, Lores said in the interview. Business customers are upgrading to machines with Microsoft Inc.’s Windows 11 and new AI PCs, which now make up more than 25% of HP’s product mix, a milestone reached a quarter ahead of the company’s target. Consumer PC sales were also better than expected, he said.

“We feel confident about the fact that PCs will continue to grow,” Lores said. “AI PCs and Windows 11 are going to continue to drive demand.”

Sales in the company’s printer unit, however, declined 4% to $3.99 billion, missing estimates, and continue to be a drag on profitability.

A daily driver laptop that can handle any use case

The IdeaPad Slim 3 features an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor with 16GB of memory, allowing you to work on spreadsheets, conduct research, and participate in video calls without any issues. The 512GB solid-state drive enables apps to load quickly and provides ample space for notes, work files, and photos. It’s ideal for people who use browsers, office programs, and stream during the day, and then want to watch a show or play a game at night that doesn’t require a high-end graphics card.

The display is suitable for both work and fun. Full HD ensures text is clear for reading, and the touch support makes it easy to zoom, navigate through slides, or draw a quick picture. If you like to write on PDFs, the screen makes highlighting and scrolling feel normal. The 15.6-inch screen also makes it worthwhile to split the screen, so you can have notes next to a lecture or a calendar next to your email without feeling crowded.

Small things make a big difference when it comes to something you use every day. The keyboard is comfortable and features a complete layout that makes typing easy. The touchpad feels accurate when you need to move quickly. There are enough ports for USB accessories, an HDMI port for a monitor, and a headset jack for making calls, so you don’t need many extra adapters. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth make it easy to connect to printers, earbuds, and a mouse, so setting up isn’t hard every time you sit down.

The Slim 3 is easy to carry, allowing it to do a wide range of things. It’s light enough to take with you, strong enough for a family to use, and good enough for a day of classes with time to stream at night. If you have a small home office, it’s easy to connect the laptop to a monitor for a comfortable two-screen setup, and then close it up when you need the desk space back.

If you’re looking for a fast, roomy touchscreen laptop for work, school, and streaming, the IdeaPad Slim 3 is currently on sale at Best Buy for $480, down from $750.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/08/lenovoideapad-1-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 18:13:18.933259

The new space includes more than 8,000 sq ft of terraces overlooking St Paul’s, with Bristows expected to move in when the building completes in Q1 2026.

Around 70,000 sq ft remains available across three floors of the all-electric building, which will feature a business lounge, roof terrace and communal terrace facing St Mary-le-Bow church.

London-based development company Fabrix was appointed earlier this year as development and leasing manager of Bow Bells on behalf of Fubon in partnership with its European strategic investment manager Patrizia.

The retrofit project is being delivered by contractor Ikon alongside White Red Architects and Arup, with completion set for early 2026 to coincide with a forecast shortage of grade-A supply.

Paul Hicks, director of development at Fabrix, said: “London’s history and future sit side by side at Bow Bells. This reimagined, all-electric City HQ places sustainability, quality and wellbeing at its core, in an unrivalled location that benefits from the outstanding transport connectivity of the Square Mile.

“Our approach has prioritised the amenities and performance features that tenants value most – from enhanced energy efficiency and fully electric M&E systems to a healthy internal environment with landscaped terraces, a design-led reception, generous communal areas and best-in-class end-of-journey facilities. Bow Bells has demonstrated our capabilities through the ultimate proof point of preletting 50% of the building, and we remain active in the market to work with partners to strategically reposition their assets in a development management capacity.”

Knight Frank and Newmark are marketing the remaining space. Cushman & Wakefield advised Bristows on the deal.

But Gardner told Sentient Media that operationalizing a ban on UPFs is harder than it sounds, especially in schools.

“There was plenty of material that was simple,” he told Sentient Media, pointing to existing consumer summaries.","Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is throwing out the rulebook on America’s official nutrition playbook. Instead of adopting recommendations that would spotlight beans and other plant proteins, Kennedy is pushing to scrap them—leaving scientists and public health experts worried about what that means for everyday diets, school lunches, and the $2 billion bean industry.

According to Sentient Media, Kennedy “wants to ditch recommendations that would encourage Americans to eat more beans and other plant proteins.” That’s a sharp departure from what the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee proposed last year. After reviewing the latest nutrition science, the panel called for beans, peas, and lentils to be elevated out of the vegetable category and recognized instead as protein sources (despite their high fiber content).

Christopher Gardner, a committee member and professor of medicine at Stanford, told Sentient Media that after submitting the report, he and his colleagues were “completely ghosted” by the Department of Health and Human Services. “No one will tell us the name of a person who’s working on it,” he said. “It’s a black box. We have no idea.”

Why beans were poised for a promotion

Beans aren’t just a side dish—they’re nutrient workhorses. The committee’s 2024 report explained that Americans fall short on fiber far more than protein. Nearly three-quarters of the population doesn’t get enough fiber, but only a small percentage lacks protein. That’s why the panel wanted legumes—beans, peas, and lentils—to have a bigger role in official recommendations.

“When they go for the meat, they’re getting no fiber,” Gardner explained to Sentient Media.

By contrast, beans deliver both protein and fiber, along with iron, folate, and a host of micronutrients. The health science is clear: swapping red or processed meats for legumes is linked to lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even early death.

The committee’s suggestion also aligned with climate goals. Our World in Data shows beef generates more than six times the greenhouse gas emissions of beans on a per-gram-protein basis. Legumes also use far less land and water, making them one of the most sustainable proteins on the planet.

Kennedy’s rejection

Instead of leaning on that science, Kennedy has said he will start from scratch. He described the committee’s document as “unreadable” and “a political document.” According to Food Fix, one of his advisers even called it “a 453-page document that looks like it was written by the food processing industry.”

Why the pushback? Gardner suspects it’s because the panel didn’t explicitly tell Americans to stop eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs). Kennedy has made attacking UPFs—from seed oils to tomato sauces with added sugar—a personal crusade. But Gardner told Sentient Media that operationalizing a ban on UPFs is harder than it sounds, especially in schools. “You could take the high fructose corn syrup out [of tomato sauce], and there are tomato sauces without that. But they cost twice as much, and the schools wouldn’t be able to afford them,” he explained.

What’s at stake for school lunch and SNAP

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans dictate more than $40 billion in federal spending every year. That includes school meals and SNAP (food stamps). When beans are highlighted as protein sources, they get baked into lesson plans, cafeteria menus, and even grocery store SNAP nudges for low-income families.

A stronger bean message would have helped schools serve more black bean burritos or lentil chili while still meeting USDA protein targets. It would also have given SNAP-Ed programs more support to promote beans as an affordable, fiber-rich choice. If that message disappears from the final guidelines, it will be harder for agencies and retailers to justify those pushes.

The bean market is growing anyway

Even without policy support, beans are having a moment. USDA data shows per-capita dry bean availability rose 30 percent in 2024, climbing to 6.8 pounds per person as supplies of black, pinto, and kidney beans surged. Chickpea imports have also rebounded, fueling hummus and snack production.

Globally, pulses now top 100 million metric tons in consumption annually, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. That growth underscores consumer appetite for affordable, protein-rich, plant-based foods. Still, US policy signals matter: less promotion could mean less investment in bean-based innovation at home.

Meanwhile, Kennedy is waging war on food dyes

While beans lose traction in Washington, DC, Kennedy’s other food fight—against artificial dyes—is gaining traction. In April, the Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture praised the International Dairy Foods Association for pledging to eliminate synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 across most US ice cream brands by 2028. Days later, Kraft Heinz said it would strip dyes from Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Crystal Light by 2027. General Mills and Nestlé have announced similar timelines.

Kennedy argues these dyes are unsafe, pointing to research linking them to hyperactivity in children and, in the case of Red 3, to cancer in lab animals. The Food and Drug Administration banned Red 3 earlier this year, but the rest remain legal. Brands admit natural dyes are costlier and less stable, but public demand is forcing the transition.

The shorter guideline debate

Kennedy has also said the new guidelines will be only four pages long, compared to the 164-page 2020 edition. Gardner says brevity was never the issue. “There was plenty of material that was simple,” he told Sentient Media, pointing to existing consumer summaries. What matters now, though, is whether those four pages will include—or exclude—the clear, science-based recommendation to eat more beans.",https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjMxMTMzL1ZlZ05ld3MuQmVhbnMuQUQwNzcuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY3JvcF9yZXNpemVkIiwiMjEyMXgxMTEzKzArNzAiLCIxMjAweDYzMF4iLHsiZm9ybWF0IjoianBnIn1dLFsicCIsIm9wdGltaXplIl1d/VegNews.Beans.AD077.jpg?sha=00bf2cae98294547,N,,2025-08-27 18:14:04.446163

“It’s not just this ambiguous patient out there,” said Holloman, a clinical research program manager at Medtronic.
Holloman is part of efforts to change that by using artificial intelligence to design technology for all from the start.
“We’re shining light, through tissue, to measure oxygen in the blood,” Case said, “You can think of this like shining a flashlight into fog to look for something.
“Imagine if we could use AI to look at small variations in the pulse to see an infection early and then do something about it,” he said.","When Keith Holloman saw how COVID-19 affected his own family, the importance of accurate healthcare technology became deeply personal.

“It’s not just this ambiguous patient out there,” said Holloman, a clinical research program manager at Medtronic. “It’s someone I care for that could benefit from our technologies.”

Holloman now works in Acute Care & Monitoring developing pulse oximeters — devices he used regularly when he worked as a respiratory therapist.

Pulse oximeters measure oxygen in the blood. They became even more critical for decision-making during the pandemic, and that surge in use spotlighted a troubling flaw: studies showed the devices can be less accurate on patients with darker skin tones.

Holloman is part of efforts to change that by using artificial intelligence to design technology for all from the start.

“We’re making sure that our technology is equitable for every patient we serve,” Holloman said.

Powered by AI

Doctors have relied on pulse oximeters for more than 40 years to monitor patients’ oxygen levels and knowing oxygen levels helps clinicians detect when a patient’s health is declining.

“They’re dependent on having an accurate measurement which potentially could result in them making decisions in terms of what level of intervention is necessary for that patient,” Holloman said of doctors.

At Medtronic, the NellcorTM pulse oximeter has been using artificial intelligence for more than 20 of those years — a move that positioned the company as an early adopter of AI to enhance device accuracy, said Jason Case, who leads research and development in the Acute Care & Monitoring business.

How does AI work in these small devices? First, consider how pulse oximetry works, he said.

“We’re shining light, through tissue, to measure oxygen in the blood,” Case said, “You can think of this like shining a flashlight into fog to look for something. And because blood moves with every heartbeat, the pulse lets us know when to take a measurement. Our AI is really good at identifying each and every pulse, and that enhances our accuracy.”

Every pulse is an opportunity to accurately measure oxygen supply, and AI in NellcorTM sees every single one – helping clinicians ensure patient safety moment-to-moment.

Still, said Case, there’s more work to be done.

The human touch

Long before pulse oximeters get clipped to a patient’s finger in the hospital, Medtronic scientists and engineers are innovating AI algorithms with the help of regular people, Holloman said.

The company opened a clinical physiology lab near the Five Points neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, to conduct its clinical trials not only with a wide array of participants but with more speed and frequency, leading to faster innovation.

“We’re looking at ways to improve our algorithms to accurately account for the variations in skin pigmentation, and we’re going a step further to actually design clinical studies that will give us the data that shows our algorithms, our new technology, is indeed accurate,” Holloman said.

The lab in Denver empowers Medtronic to not only examine current device performance but to inform new designs. This work includes thinking through how AI can help predict and prevent complications – perhaps even before a doctor knows something’s wrong, Case said.

“Imagine if we could use AI to look at small variations in the pulse to see an infection early and then do something about it,” he said.

The technology under development has been accepted into the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Safer Technologies Program for Medical Devices (STeP) — a designation that accelerates the development, assessment, and review of devices that are expected to improve the safety of current treatments.

“This means a ton for our patients,” Case said.

This article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance.
The editorial staff of Risk & Insurance had no role in its preparation.","Marine insurance at Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance has evolved far beyond its traditional maritime-focused origins, with only a small part of the company’s marine portfolio actually involving vessels on water, while the remainder encompasses diverse modern risks from data centers supporting artificial intelligence to construction equipment and supply chain coverage. This transformation reflects broader industry shifts as marine insurers adapt to contemporary business needs while maintaining the collaborative expertise that has historically defined the sector.

The term “marine insurance” has become something of a misnomer in today’s market. “When I say marine, everyone thinks about ships, yet our marine portfolio at BHSI is only about 5% on water,” explains Ben Wyatt, Head of Marine, U.S. at BHSI. “The portfolio is comprised of inland marine risks, domestic transportation and warehousing through the cargo stock throughput product.”

This evolution encompasses contractors’ equipment, including everything from warehouse forklifts to construction cranes and port equipment. Oil and gas equipment falls within this category, as does much of the emerging data center work. The marine team also handles smaller builders’ risks, highlighting how construction projects now fall under marine insurance coverage.

“We also have an excellent team that specializes in more complex, larger builders’ risk projects, and we remain very collaborative with them, sharing knowledge, expertise and experience,” he said.

Stock throughput products offer comprehensive transit and storage coverage—essentially cradle-to-grave protection for goods and inventory throughout the supply chain. Despite the product’s value, Wyatt notes that “we’re still having conversations educating established large companies about the benefits of the stock throughput coverage, whether they have a risk manager or not.”

Many companies don’t realize their property coverage may include transit protection, but it’s often sublimited with higher deductibles and restrictive terms. The global supply chain has faced numerous challenges in recent years, from the current conflicts and COVID disruptions to the Suez Canal blockage, U.S. port congestion, and labor strikes.

The marine insurance market presents several compelling opportunities driven by technological advancement and economic shifts. BHSI is positioning itself to insure data centers and servers supporting AI infrastructure, representing a significant departure from traditional marine risks while still falling within the sector’s expanded scope.

“We’re looking to insure data centers and servers supporting AI, while still managing traditional challenges like war conflicts and vessels navigating troublesome areas,” Wyatt said.

Vessel size increases over the past decade have created substantial insurance requirements. “The limits required for U.S.-based and global customers in the petrochemical, oil, gas, and LNG sectors are significant, as they can have $100-150 million worth of LNG or oil on a single ship,” Wyatt observes. This necessitates substantial insurance coverage limits that create opportunities for insurers capable of handling such exposures.

Beyond petrochemicals, manufacturers and distributors require higher limits due to price increases, particularly in cargo coverage. While specific data would be so wide ranging, Wyatt believes “the average value of goods in a container has increased significantly over the past decade”.

The stock throughput market presents particular promise as supply chain complexity increases. Companies are recognizing the need for more comprehensive coverage as they face ongoing challenges including geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and infrastructure disruptions.

BHSI’s marine team, which has grown to 10 members over 18 months under Wyatt’s leadership, structures itself around specialized expertise rather than traditional ocean and inland marine divisions. The team includes cargo stock throughput specialists, a transportation segment focused on domestic trucking and warehouse legal liability, contractors’ equipment and floaters coverage, and builders’ risk expertise.

“I structured our team around expertise, not trying to make everyone a jack of all trades but fostering specialist knowledge with collaboration,” Wyatt explains. Team members consult with colleagues when working outside their primary expertise, recognizing that comprehensive marine underwriting requires diverse knowledge sets.

Geographic distribution across New York, Boston, and Chicago supports market understanding while presenting collaboration challenges. The company maintains an in-office focused work week and views individual and group efforts to communicate as key to fostering meaningful and effective connections. “Successful collaboration comes down to the character of the people we’ve brought into the team,” Wyatt emphasizes.

Character and Capability

Character assessment focuses on two core values: respect and passion. “I believe to enable effective collaboration and communication you have to respect your teammates above all else,” Wyatt states. “Passion is equally important because it drives motivation. This includes passion for the team, company, colleagues, knowledge expansion, and achieving positive results.”

The team’s success depends on four key elements: service, expertise, flexibility, and BHSI’s financial stability. Service remains paramount for building broker relationships and understanding customers. Expertise enables informed decision-making in difficult markets, while flexibility allows creative solutions tailored to individual customer situations.

“We’re building as collaborative a culture as possible because we see the value in it,” Wyatt said.

“It requires effort from all team members to pick up the phone and have discussions with colleagues in different offices,” he added.

“The success of our team depends on individuals’ character, willingness and desire to contribute to our collective success.”

This collaborative approach extends to customer relationships, where value alignment proves crucial across the spectrum from small wholesale deals to sophisticated Fortune 500 companies. Recent customer interactions demonstrate this flexibility, with one risk manager receiving 12 different deductible options to balance risk retention versus transfer.

“I love how our team challenges each other, including those who specialize in specific areas,” Wyatt said.

“Sometimes they receive unexpected questions about how different coverages interact or why certain practices have persisted in the marine industry,” he said.

“These interactions lead to valuable insights and continuous learning within our team.”

As technology continues reshaping the insurance landscape, BHSI’s marine team is exploring how to maintain personalized service standards while leveraging technological advances, particularly for complex, unique risks that require bespoke solutions technology alone cannot provide.

For his part, Wyatt counts himself thankful for being in a branch of insurance with a long history that is pivoting to meet the challenges of today.

“My background gives me a unique perspective on this evolution,” Wyatt said.

“I worked in Lloyds’ for ten years before moving to the U.S. six and a half years ago,” he added.

“I’ve always specialized in marine insurance, starting in ocean marine primarily on the cargo side, then expanding into inland marine after moving to America. Now I lead a great team handling both ocean and inland marine underwriting across all product lines.”

The company's recent direct-to-chip liquid cooling innovation helps data centers respond to changing operations as they address rising demand for water and energy resources.
With this offering and others for cooling water and adiabatic applications, Ecolab can support the entire data center cooling landscape from site to chip.","Data centers have become a critical part of daily life. With the advent of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other high-performance computing, or HPC, applications, it’s estimated that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19% and 22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts.

As the pressure placed on data center providers increases and facilities grow to accommodate heavier computing loads, their heat load will grow along with them. HPC applications require advanced chips that use more power and generate more heat than traditional servers. This means data center operators will need to find new, more effective ways to manage cooling.

One solution is direct-to-chip liquid cooling, which brings cooling power directly to the heat source, or server chips, via an integrated loop of piping that circulates coolant through the servers.

Ecolab, a global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions, is focused on data center liquid cooling. To protect servers and cooling infrastructure, the company has developed 3D TRASAR technology for direct-to-chip applications. The system provides real-time monitoring of coolant health and other parameters to help data centers maintain efficient and reliable performance.

Ecolab Senior Corporate Account Manager Matt McMullen said that 3D TRASAR monitoring technology has been around for more than two decades, with more than 50,000 systems implemented at customer locations. The company's recent direct-to-chip liquid cooling innovation helps data centers respond to changing operations as they address rising demand for water and energy resources.

3D TRASAR technology uses smart sensors to allow for remote monitoring and reporting to help a variety of cooling operations run efficiently. With this offering and others for cooling water and adiabatic applications, Ecolab can support the entire data center cooling landscape from site to chip.

”We’re leveraging our industry experience across other critical loops to create a best practice around real-time monitoring and control,” McMullen said. “Our approach ultimately helps maximize cooling, optimize water usage and extend the life cycle of critical equipment for data center operators.”

McMullen continued to reflect that data center demand is expected to rise four times its current capacity in the next five years, and it's bringing a lot of stress to its infrastructure. 3D TRASAR technology helps alleviate this burden, particularly through smart water management resources in the data center.

McMullen described smart water management as a holistic approach that looks at a data center’s available water sources and takes into account climate versus cooling options, local regulation and water consumption during power generation.

“Our company looks at all of these factors to determine the best way to leverage the existing water and find out how to leverage it for reduced energy consumption and reliable cooling,” he said.

Data centers require significant power to operate, and newer cooling systems are not only expensive to run but can be even more costly when they go down. McMullen said that finding the best practice for maximizing coolant health and heat transfer efficiencies can minimize the energy needed for cooling and help reduce downtime.

“By reducing the power use or maintaining lower power use, we can extend the life of the coolant and limit data center downtime,” he said. “Changing a coolant in a critical space is difficult, and we want to avoid a disruption in the data center such as overheating or potential equipment failure.”

3D TRASAR has already created a positive impact for data centers, particularly through its ability to connect to Water Quality IQ performance insights for cooling water. In 2024, Ecolab collaborated with data center service provider Digital Realty to use AI-driven insights in 35 of Digital Realty’s U.S. facilities for its water-cooling operations.

“Our platform helped focus on a variety of Digital Realty sites to address water-related optimization opportunities,” McMullen said. “When fully implemented, we believe the solution will help avoid the withdrawal of up to 126 million gallons of potable water from local watersheds annually.”

McMullen said that more data center companies need to think about smart cooling early in the design phase, particularly evaporative cooling. One example is adiabatic cooling. Adiabatic cooling uses the natural process of water evaporation to cool air, reducing the need for mechanical cooling systems like chillers, which lowers operational costs and reduces power usage.

3D TRASAR is available to monitor adiabatic cooling activity as well. McMullen said this will be more widespread for operations over the next 10 years.

“There's a saying in the industry: The most sustainable data center is the one you didn't build,” McMullen said. “To get more out of each data center, it starts with the design phase and the idea of smart water and evaporative cooling to help lower your PUE.”

McMullen said he believes a smart water management approach will be adopted even more as data center operators look to non-potable water sources to cool their facilities and reduce environmental impact.

“Like many industries, data centers can leverage reclaimed water while still prioritizing reliable, high-performing operations,” McMullen said. “At Ecolab, we’re not only looking at recycling multiple types of water sources, like rainwater, gray water and black water, but also helping our customers do this in a more sustainable and cost-effective way.”

Barclays has upgraded its price target for Sempra Energy (SRE) to $80 from $71, while maintaining an 'Equal-Weight' rating on the shares. This move reflects the analyst's positive outlook on Sempra's strong financial performance and strategic growth initiatives. The new target implies a potential upside of approximately 15% from the current share price of $71.00 [1].

Sempra Energy, a major utility company, serves a significant customer base in the United States, distributing natural gas and electricity in Southern California and owning a substantial stake in Oncor, a Texas-based transmission and distribution business. The company's recent financial results have been robust, with analysts forecasting an earnings per share (EPS) of $4.76 for the current year, up from the previous year's $0.89 [2].

The upgrade in the price target comes amidst mixed analyst ratings. While Barclays has raised its target, BMO Capital Markets has also increased its target to $81.00, reflecting a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" [2]. The overall consensus among analysts suggests a target price of $83.61, with a high estimate of $91.00 and a low estimate of $76.43 [1].

Sempra Energy's strategic initiatives, including its investments in infrastructure and renewable energy projects, have bolstered its financial prospects. The company's focus on sustainable energy solutions and its strong market position in the utility sector are key drivers for the positive outlook [2].

Institutional investors have also shown interest in Sempra Energy, with Raymond James Financial Inc. reducing its holdings by 3.6% in the first quarter but still retaining a significant stake valued at approximately $96.9 million [2]. Other institutional investors, such as Mattson Financial Services LLC and Opal Wealth Advisors LLC, have also increased their stakes in the company [2].

Overall, the upgrade in the price target by Barclays underscores the positive sentiment surrounding Sempra Energy's growth prospects and strong financial performance. Investors should closely monitor the company's future earnings and strategic initiatives to gauge the potential for further upside in the stock price.

In a recent interview, Hendrik Streeck, appointed Commissioner on April 28, 2025, provided further insight into the new government’s thoughts on a multi-stage evaluation of Germany’s cannabis regulations, which is currently underway.

The first results from that evaluation are expected this fall, with additional findings to follow in the spring.

The Commissioner takes specific exception with how Germans currently can access medical cannabis online, and highlights concerns with the country’s cultivation laws for non-medical cannabis.

“We’ll have to look at some figures, such as the development of the black market, traffic accident statistics, the number of users, but also whether there’s an increase in cannabis-induced psychoses,” Streeck told the Rheinische Post, a prominent German regional daily newspaper, in an interview published on August 27.

While the Commissioner told the publication that it was too early to respond to specific policy questions regarding issues like home cultivation, cultivation clubs—which are currently allowed—and the possibility of sales through pharmacies, he did say that growing three plants at home is “far too much for personal use.”

“That’s an enormous amount. A knowledgeable owner with a green thumb can harvest about a kilo of cannabis with it,” Streeck told the publication, saying there is a clear need to reform Germany’s cannabis laws.

A joint document from the country’s recently elected coalition government said earlier this year that there would be “an open-ended evaluation of the law on the legalization of cannabis” in the fall, which was already planned as part of the original legislation.

Although the previous German government had created several new avenues for accessing cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes, the recently elected Conservative government (CDU) has said that it does not support easier access to cannabis, seeking to roll back a recent surge in Germans using cannabis under the medical program.

According to one analyst, it’s estimated that approximately between 700,000 and 900,000 individuals in Germany are accessing medical cannabis through pharmacies.

A new bill in Germany seeks to restrict how people access medical cannabis, rolling back rules that have allowed online consultations and mail order delivery from pharmacies. The bill seeks to restrict how people can access cannabis for medical purposes, requiring in-person authorizations for cannabis, as well as in-person sales (the Bill can be viewed here, translated). The move could significantly impact the country’s medical cannabis imports.

Germany first allowed the prescribing of cannabis flowers for medical purposes by physicians in 2017. The country then legalized recreational, non-medical cannabis in March 2024. The law came into effect in two phases.

The first phase, which allowed for personal cannabis cultivation and possession, came into force on April 1, 2024, and cultivation clubs were allowed in July. More than 100 of these clubs have already been approved.

The second phase was intended to facilitate regional model projects with commercial supply chains; however, shifting domestic politics appears to have slowed down that process.

“The law must definitely be more stringent and coherent,” the new Commissioner of the Federal Government for Drug and Addiction Policy told the Rheinische Post. “It isn’t at the moment. For everything else, we’ll have to wait and see what the evaluation reveals. There are no restrictions on thinking here.

“The situation is different with medicinal cannabis. Medicinal cannabis is currently being abused too often for recreational use. Health Minister Warken has already proposed a change in the law, which I welcome. It cannot be that online pharmacies deliberately direct people through medical forms in order to immediately obtain private prescriptions for medicinal cannabis. As a doctor, all the alarm bells are going off for me here. Imagine that with other medications. We also need to make adjustments with regard to medicinal cannabis.”

While the Commissioner seems to support some forms of cannabis for medical purposes, he takes exception with cannabis flower and the way flower is traditionally consumed.

“While capsules and drops have a constant active ingredient content, the THC content of flowers fluctuates considerably depending on the plant and harvest. This is precisely the problem: Sales of cannabis flowers have increased by 80 percent—​​a clear indication that this is less about alleviating illness than about consumption.

“Flowers are usually smoked, damage the lungs, and increase the risk of cancer. For the treatment of pain or epilepsy, capsules and drops are the medically sensible form – precisely dosed, evidence-based, and safe. Current developments show that many have simply switched from the black market to a legal loophole. This is an abuse of medical regulations. We have a proven system in Germany: doctors make diagnoses, prescribe medications in clear dosages, and pharmacies dispense them in a controlled manner. This principle must also apply to cannabis. That’s why I am in favor of no longer prescribing cannabis flowers.”

Cannabis from Canada supplies much of the German medical market. In the second quarter of 2025, Germany imported 43,257 kg of cannabis for medical purposes, with nearly half (20,107 kg) coming from Canada, an increase from the 16,057 kg imported from Canada in Q1 2025.

Portugal exported the second-highest amount of cannabis into Germany in the same period, with 13,465 kg. Portugal often acts as an intermediary between countries like Canada and Germany, thereby adding to Canada’s overall exports to the European Union’s most populous country.

A distant third was Denmark, exporting 2,282 kg of cannabis to Germany’s medical cannabis program in Q2 2025.

Bloomwell Group, a Frankfurt-based medical cannabis company, recently released new data and a map showing the distribution of medical cannabis patients across Germany, highlighting areas with the most and least patients.

A ban on accessing cannabis online and through the mail could affect about half of all registered patients in Germany, argues the company, driving many of these medical consumers back into the illicit market.

There are three licensed medical cannabis producers in Germany. Two companies, Tilray and Aurora, are based in Canada, while a German company, Demecan, is the third.

Bad bosses are made,"" Mallick, who worked at Unilever until 2020, told Business Insider.
The book outlines 13 bad boss archetypes — from the micromanager to the credit thief, the chaos agent to the fearmonger.
The grinner This boss, Mallick said, was beloved, kind, cheerful, always smiling.
""Bad bosses steal it.""","You might think you're a good boss — supportive, fair, and hardworking. But what if you're the reason your team dreads Monday?

That's the uncomfortable question former Unilever and Johnson & Johnson marketing executive Mita Mallick asks in her forthcoming book, ""The Devil Emails at Midnight: What Good Leaders Can Learn from Bad Bosses.""

""Bad bosses aren't born bad. Bad bosses are made,"" Mallick, who worked at Unilever until 2020, told Business Insider.

The title nods to one of her first bosses, a manager whose communication style was to send barrages of emails at midnight. Spoiler alert: that's probably not a great idea.

The book outlines 13 bad boss archetypes — from the micromanager to the credit thief, the chaos agent to the fearmonger. All, Mallick argues, can be changed if leaders are willing to be honest with themselves.

1. The devil who emails at midnight

During a summer internship, Mallick's boss barely interacted with her in person. Instead, she sent midnight email barrages with urgent tasks and no context. Mallick started replying out of fear.

Mallick said she had just two 15-minute meetings with her across an entire 11-week internship.

She recommends auditing your calendar to make space for your team during business hours. If you work late, use scheduled send — and be clear that responses can wait until morning.

2. The boss who gives unwanted nicknames

This manager renamed Mallick ""Mohammed"" because her real name, Madhumita, was ""too hard."" Others joined in. Mallick eventually quit.

She advises learning and using people's names correctly and fostering team norms that call out microaggressions early. Don't make colleagues do the emotional labor of explaining why it hurt.

3. The napper

This boss routinely slept in meetings, delegated everything, and gossiped about how much he hated his job. He was actively disengaged, yet inexplicably tolerated by leadership.

Mallick says leaders should be proactive about disengagement, whether it's their own or someone else's. Her ""be a mirror"" framework involves giving feedback, creating space for honesty, and building an improvement plan with clear accountability.

4. The chopper

This boss insisted on being cc'd on every email, nitpicked minor formatting, and constantly redid her team's work, even when it didn't need redoing.

Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Mallick warns micromanagement erodes trust. Instead, she recommends focusing on outcomes, coaching through mistakes, and resisting the urge to hover. Ask yourself: Is this about quality or control?

5. The white rabbit

This boss turned every task into a crisis. Urgent huddles, moving deadlines, and panic-driven chaos became the norm.

Mallick recommends defining urgency explicitly. Her framework — Define, Prioritize, Protect — helps leaders keep focus and avoid burning out their teams with fake fire drills.

6. 'Medusa'

This boss screamed at staff, berated people for salad orders, and once hurled a designer shoe at a colleague.

""Fear kills communication, trust, and innovation,"" Mallick writes. She urges leaders to stop equating intensity with authority and instead create safe spaces where people feel heard and respected.

7. The great pretender

After Mallick announced her pregnancy, she described how this manager reassigned her projects, denied her opportunities, and sent constant ""quick asks"" while she was on leave — all while promoting herself as an ally to working moms.

She advises asking team members what they need — don't assume. ""Protective"" behaviors rooted in bias often sideline ambitious employees.

8. The grinner

This boss, Mallick said, was beloved, kind, cheerful, always smiling. But he was utterly incompetent, per Mallick.

He had no idea what to do on the job and outsourced everything to his team.

Mallick stresses that kindness isn't a substitute for competence. If you're in over your head, ask for help, get trained, or reconsider whether managing people is right for you.

9. The cheerleader

This boss was relentlessly positive and used that positivity to deny reality. He ignored challenges and set impossible goals, then blamed the team when they missed them.

Mallick recommends replacing ""toxic positivity"" with grounded optimism. Validate struggles. Don't ask people to smile through setbacks — support them through solutions.

10. 'Gossip Girl'

Mallic said this boss shared confidential information, spread rumors about team members, and used gossip to maintain power.

Mallick was eventually accused of saying something she hadn't, and nearly lost a key workplace friendship over it.

""Just don't engage,"" she advises. Set norms that shut gossip down and build a culture of transparency where people feel seen without backchanneling.

11. The spotlight stealer

This manager plagiarized teamwork, lifted Mallick's entire self-review, and asked her to email his boss with fabricated praise.

She advises letting people present their own work. ""Good leaders share the spotlight,"" she writes. ""Bad bosses steal it.""

12. 'Tony Soprano'

When Mallick explored internal opportunities, her boss accused her of betrayal. He called her a ""rat,"" tried to block her transfer, and forced her to quit to escape him.

""You don't own your team,"" she writes. Leaders must support growth, not punish ambition. Let people go when they're ready to grow.

13. The grieving boss

Mallick's most personal story: after her father died, she became inconsistent, emotionally distant, and reactive — everything she had warned others about.

She said that when a team member quit, it was a wake-up call.

She recommends being honest when you're not OK. Take time off. Set expectations. Grief doesn't excuse bad leadership, but ignoring it can create more harm.",https://i.insider.com/686fa8663d5881a51c1d0c9c?width=750&format=jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 19:12:57.496062

Barclays Keeps Overweight Rating, Raises Ncino Price Target to $37.

Barclays analyst Saket Kalia has raised the firm's price target for nCino (NCNO) to $37 from $31, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares [1].

Chris Gannatti, Head of Global Research at WisdomTree, remarked that ""if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, gold will become the preferred safe-haven asset for investors.""","U.S. President Trump has taken action to dismiss a member of the Federal Reserve Board, a move that could undermine confidence in the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury bonds, while enhancing the appeal of gold and other assets regarded as safe havens.

James St. Aubin of Ocean Park Asset Management stated, ""The independence of the Federal Reserve is its hallmark, and the act of dismissing a board member is a direct attack on its ability to formulate monetary policy free from political motivation. When you begin to weaken confidence in the monetary policy of a global reserve currency, you are playing with fire. If the market believes that the Federal Reserve is setting policy based on direct political influence, U.S. assets will lose their appeal.""

On Monday evening, Trump announced the immediate dismissal of Cook on 'Truth Social,' attempting to shake the credibility of the central bank. However, his legal authority to do so is being questioned.

Robert Savage, Managing Director and Head of Market Strategy and Insights at Bank of New York Mellon, stated that the dismissal of Cook represents ""a historic test of presidential power in the United States."" In an email, he noted that a loss of trust in the Federal Reserve's independence would pose long-term risks to U.S. bonds and the dollar, thereby limiting investors' safe-haven options.

On Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose slightly (bond yields move inversely to prices), while the U.S. dollar index fell slightly.

Savage stated that the market's reaction to Cook's dismissal is ""temporarily muted due to legal proceedings,"" expecting this process to last for several months. The importance of Federal Reserve independence lies in the historical concerns over government intervention in interest rate cuts to promote pro-cyclical policies, which has been a driver of inflation exceeding 2%. He added, ""The risk of a bubble bursting increases, leading to shorter business cycles.""

In the long run, inflation exceeding 2% also comes at a cost, Savage pointed out, ""This manifests as a reduction in fixed income duration holdings, thereby limiting long-term business investment.""

Controversies and Market Games Surrounding the Independence of the Federal Reserve

Kevin Flanagan, Head of Income Strategy at WisdomTree, stated that if the independence of the Federal Reserve is ultimately called into question, it could have a ""negative impact on the back end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve... but we are not at that point yet."" In the short term, the market's focus is on the upcoming employment and inflation data, as well as the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

Flanagan noted that once Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell resumes interest rate cuts in September as expected, the issue of the Fed's independence may ""become irrelevant.""

Some believe that the Federal Reserve has never truly been free from government politics. Stefan Gleason, President and CEO of Money Metals, stated that the independence of the Federal Reserve is a ""myth.""

He pointed out that the Federal Reserve is ""essentially a political institution, not only because the Board is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but also because our entire monetary system today has a political nature. We no longer have a sound currency backed by gold; rather, we have a political currency that is centrally planned by policymakers through monetary policy adjustments.""

The Rise of Alternative Assets

However, once trust in the Federal Reserve fractures, the risks associated with the dollar and U.S. Treasuries increase, inflation rises, and investors will rush to seek alternative assets. Savage from Bank of New York Mellon stated that traditionally, investors hedge against high inflation through physical assets, including gold, oil, and industrial metals.

Gold may top the list of candidates. Chris Gannatti, Head of Global Research at WisdomTree, remarked that ""if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, gold will become the preferred safe-haven asset for investors."" The company believes that any threat to the Fed's independence serves as a ""powerful catalyst for gold demand.""

""Gold does not have counterparty risk, does not rely on government credibility, and has a historical record of thousands of years as the ultimate store of value,"" said Ganatti. ""During periods of political or monetary uncertainty, it is the most trusted asset for investors to preserve value."" Data from 2025 supports this, with Ganatti noting that global central banks are expected to purchase approximately 1,000 tons of gold this year, marking a fourth consecutive year of significant accumulation.

Savage from the Bank of New York Mellon stated that ""investing internationally in countries with stable growth and low inflation"" also helps hedge against high inflation in the United States. Thus, commodities and international investments ""are clear alternative choices for current investors.""

The situation regarding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as alternative assets is more complex, as they play an important role in emerging markets with depreciating fiat currencies. Savage noted, ""They also involve payment systems and the growing demand for banking services in frontier markets.""

Overall, Jim Masturzo, Chief Investment Officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at Research Affiliates, indicated that when the risk of financial assets rises (such as when the Federal Reserve loses its independence), physical assets like gold and real estate will become safe havens.

""Investors have enjoyed substantial returns from the U.S. stock and bond markets over the past 15 years,"" he remarked. ""Regardless of the risks to the Federal Reserve's independence, U.S. stock valuations are nearing historic highs, making it a good time to take profits and focus on other safe-haven assets.""",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022051003430642c0f32ef870d.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:31:39.353305

Moody's highlights Air Liquide's ability to navigate the volatile industrial gas market, driven by its strategic investments and operational efficiency.

The latest rating affirmation comes amidst Air Liquide's significant expansion in South Korea, where the company has signed a binding agreement to acquire DIG Airgas for €2.85 billion [1]. This acquisition, expected to close in the first semester of 2026, will strengthen Air Liquide's market position in the sixth-largest manufacturing country by GDP and the fourth-largest industrial gas market [2]. The deal is part of Air Liquide's strategy to expand its footprint and tap into South Korea's high-tech sectors, including semiconductors, clean energy, and mobility.

Air Liquide's CEO, François Jackow, commented on the acquisition, stating that it aligns with the company's commitment to profitable long-term growth. The acquisition will enable Air Liquide to build a reference player in South Korea, leveraging DIG Airgas's strong operational assets and backlog of nearly 20 secured projects [2]. This strategic move is expected to contribute to Air Liquide's net profit growth within one year of integration.

From a financial perspective, the transaction values DIG Airgas at a 2024 EBITDA multiple of 20.2, reducing to 14.8 when factoring in secured project backlogs and cost synergies [2]. Air Liquide plans to finance the deal initially through a structured bridge loan, later refinanced via bond issuance.

The acquisition not only strengthens Air Liquide's leadership in Asia and the global electronics sector but also underlines its long-term dedication to South Korea's economic growth and clean energy transition [2]. Moody's expects Air Liquide to continue its growth trajectory, driven by its strong financial standing and global footprint.

Transcend Plus delivers major advancements in image quality and artificial intelligence (AI), including newly FDA-cleared 2D and 3D image quality enhancements and a growing suite of AI-enabled clinical applications — all designed to meet the growing challenges of cardiac care. With increased patient volume, rising clinical complexity and persistent staffing shortages, Transcend Plus is designed to help cardiology teams by offering fast, reproducible results with uncompromising image quality and decision-making support.

""Transcend Plus represents a bold leap forward in the evolution of echocardiography, reinforcing our commitment to continuous innovation, empowering clinicians with AI-driven tools that enhance confidence, accelerate decision-making, and elevate care at every stage of the cardiac journey,” said David Handler, Business Leader, Cardiology Ultrasound at Philips. “Transcend Plus is more than an advancement – it’s a clear statement of Philips’ leadership in cardiovascular ultrasound. Building on the momentum of our original Transcend launch, Transcend Plus brings the full power of AI integration to the forefront, giving clinicians the confidence, speed, and precision they need to lead in cardiac care – today and into the future.”

Enhanced Image Quality

Transcend Plus visibly improves sharpness, contrast and detail in 2D and 3D imaging, featuring the latest FDA-cleared enhancements for EPIQ CVx and Affiniti CVx. These upgrades support superior visualization of cardiac anatomy and function, enabling diagnostic confidence even in the most complex or technically challenging cases. The update also introduces the new 2D Auto EF Advanced feature, expanding AI capabilities for contrast images – essential for accurately assessing cardiac function.

FDA-cleared AI Applications, Now Fully Integrated

Philips now offers 26 FDA-cleared cardiovascular ultrasound AI applications — the most in the industry — fully integrated into Transcend Plus for both EPIQ and Affiniti CVx systems. Among the latest enhancements to receive FDA 510(k) clearance are 2D Auto EF and 2D Auto EF Advanced. These advanced tools are designed to streamline clinical workflows and improve diagnostic accuracy across a range of care settings, from the echo lab through the hospital to outpatient clinics, pre-assessment, and long-term follow-up. With these integrated AI applications, clinicians can assess patients more quickly, consistently, and confidently across the entire care continuum.

Left Ventricular Function Assessment

Left ventricular (LV) function assessment is one of the most critical applications in cardiac imaging, playing a central role in diagnosing and managing a wide range of cardiac conditions. Transcend Plus directly supports this need by delivering fast, reproducible results that help cardiologists quickly and definitively evaluate LV function consistently across different patients and over time. Automated tools minimize operator variability, ensuring more reliable and standardized measurements, especially vital in high-volume or high-pressure clinical environments. In addition, Transcend Plus offers robust support for both contrast and non-contrast imaging. The 2D Auto EF feature enables accurate assessments even when contrast agents cannot be used, such as in patients with renal impairment. Building on this, 2D Auto EF Advanced adds AI-powered quantification capabilities for both contrast and non-contrast studies, broadening clinical applicability and enhancing measurement reliability in patients with poor image quality or challenging acoustic windows. These capabilities combine to deliver a more confident, efficient approach to cardiac care.

Clinical Confidence

Transcend Plus empowers clinicians to make fast, confident decisions across every cardiac care setting – whether in the echo lab, interventional suite, or during routine outpatient assessments. By delivering sharper imaging and intelligent automation, it enables more informed care, streamlines workflows, and helps providers manage growing patient volumes without compromising diagnostic quality or clinician well-being. Transcend Plus delivers three core benefits: enhanced image quality for clearer visualization of cardiac anatomy and improved diagnostic precision; advanced AI integration, with 26 FDA-cleared applications that automate and accelerate routine tasks; and faster, more actionable insights that reduce delays and support timely, evidence-based clinical decisions throughout the care journey.

Transcend Plus will be demonstrated live at the European Society of Cardiology 2025 Congress in Madrid and the American Society of Echocardiography meeting in Nashville.",http://www.dicardiology.com/sites/default/files/Philips%20transcend-plus-ultrasound-system.Jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:34:40.370271

This integration, set to begin next year, is part of Amazon's broader effort to streamline its operations and enhance collaboration and innovation within its grocery division.

Effective December 8, 2025, Whole Foods corporate employees will transition to Amazon's systems and programs. This shift includes replacing Whole Foods' unique benefits, such as in-store discounts and four weeks of remote work per year, with Amazon's standard offerings. Additionally, Whole Foods employees will receive Amazon stock as part of their compensation package instead of an annual bonus.

Amazon spokesperson Lauren Snyder emphasized that the move is designed to bring the grocery teams closer together, fostering better collaboration and innovation. The integration comes as Amazon ramps up its in-house grocery business to compete with rivals like Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART), and Kroger (KR) with same-day delivery of fresh groceries.

The announcement has had a mixed impact on the market. While Amazon's shares have risen, the news has also weighed on competitors' shares. This integration marks a continuation of Amazon's strategy to centralize Whole Foods' operations and scale back some of its distinctive perks and benefits since its acquisition in 2017.

Whole Foods employees have expressed concerns about the cultural shift, but Amazon maintains that the integration is essential for driving collaboration and innovation. After the transition, in-store discounts will be reserved for Whole Foods in-store employees, starting in 2027.

Brazil's Marinho comments in ‘worst case scenario for tariffs’

Brazil's steel industry is facing an uncertain future as the expiration of key trade protections and escalating geopolitical tensions loom large. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, has been navigating these challenges with its $25 billion investment in Brazil, which includes a significant expansion of its Tubarão plant. The company's strategic decisions are closely tied to the political landscape and trade policies.

According to a recent statement by ArcelorMittal's Brazil head, Jorge Oliveira, the company's expansion plans for the Tubarão plant could be delayed or canceled if the Brazilian government does not extend current trade protections by May 2025. The expiration of these protections, along with the ongoing U.S. tariffs, poses a significant risk to ArcelorMittal's investment pipeline and the 1.2 million jobs it supports in Brazil's construction and automotive sectors [1].

The U.S. has imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian steel, disrupting ArcelorMittal's export strategy and forcing it to redirect shipments to European plants and accelerate U.S. production. While the U.S. later exempted Brazilian pig iron from the tariff, the broader trade war has had a substantial impact on ArcelorMittal's operations and financial performance. The company has already incurred financial losses of $150 million in 2025 due to these tariffs [1].

Brazil's political landscape adds another layer of risk. The U.S. tariffs, framed as politically motivated, have strained bilateral relations and raised questions about the durability of trade protections. Analysts speculate that the tariffs could be reversed before August 1, 2025, given Brazil's trade deficit with the U.S. and its lack of competitive threat in the steel sector. However, the Brazilian government's response remains unpredictable [1].

Investors are closely monitoring the situation. The risks for investors are clear: if trade policies remain unstable, ArcelorMittal's $25 billion investment could yield subpar returns. Additionally, rising interest rates in Brazil, projected to hit 14.75%, threaten to dampen demand in the automotive sector, a key client for ArcelorMittal [1].

Yet, the opportunities are equally compelling. A successful expansion in Brazil would solidify ArcelorMittal's position as a global steel leader. The company's recent acquisition of Nippon Steel's stake in the Calvert joint venture and the launch of a new electric arc furnace in Alabama demonstrate its agility in navigating trade barriers. If the Brazilian government extends tariffs and strengthens import controls, ArcelorMittal's domestic market share could grow, enhancing its EBITDA contribution [1].

For investors, the key is to monitor trade policy developments in Brazil and the U.S. ArcelorMittal's ability to pivot, such as its U.S. production expansion, mitigates some risks. However, long-term success depends on political stability. The resolution of the U.S. tariffs will be a critical inflection point. A reversal could unlock $200 million in annual savings for ArcelorMittal, while a prolonged trade war could force further cost-sharing with customers [1].

Looking ahead, Abercrombie raised its full-year outlook, citing strong momentum and continued confidence in its global brands.

Overall, Abercrombie & Fitch sales climbed 7%, led by 19% growth at Hollister – the brand's best-ever second-quarter net sales growth, the company said.
Comparable sales across the business rose 3%, led by Hollister, which also saw comparable sales grow 19%.
During the quarter, sales in its Asia-Pacific region grew 12%, while international comparable sales climbed 3%.
That was offset by a slowdown in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales slid 1% and comparable sales were down 5%.","Abercrombie & Fitch sales growth slowed again in its fiscal second quarter as the apparel company struggles to top the surge it enjoyed last fiscal year.

During the quarter, sales at the namesake Abercrombie brand fell 5% while comparable sales dropped 11%.

But the success of the teen-focused Hollister brand helped to salvage the quarter. Overall, Abercrombie & Fitch sales climbed 7%, led by 19% growth at Hollister – the brand's best-ever second-quarter net sales growth, the company said. Comparable sales across the business rose 3%, led by Hollister, which also saw comparable sales grow 19%.

Abercrombie narrowly beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company also hiked its full-year revenue outlook and now expects sales to climb 5% to 7%, compared with previous guidance of 3% to 6% growth. Much of that range would top Wall Street expectations of 5.2% growth, according to LSEG.

The company's shares were down in afternoon trading.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.32 adjusted vs. $2.30 expected

Revenue: $1.21 billion vs. $1.20 billion expected

Abercrombie's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $141 million, or $2.91 per share, compared with $133 million, or $2.50 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the impact of a favorable litigation settlement, Abercrombie saw earnings of $2.32 per share.

Sales rose to $1.21 billion, up about 7% from $1.13 billion a year earlier.

""We entered the second half of 2025 on offense,"" CEO Fran Horowitz said in a news release. ""We are increasing our full year net sales outlook, reflecting our strong positioning and growth trajectory, building on record 2024 results. Our team remains focused on delivering for our customers while investing to capitalize on the significant, long-term opportunities for our global brands.""

For its current quarter, Abercrombie's also gave a better-than-expected sales outlook. It anticipates revenue will rise between 5% and 7%, beating expectations of 4.3% growth, according to LSEG.

Meanwhile, its profit outlook for the fiscal third quarter is weaker than expected. The company anticipates earnings per share will be between $2.05 and $2.25, far below expectations of $2.53, according to LSEG.

Abercrombie said it expects its operating margin, a closely watched metric on Wall Street, to be between 11% and 12% during its current quarter, also lower than Wall Street expectations of 13.3%, according to StreetAccount. The company said a $25 million tariff cost, net of mitigation efforts, is expected to weigh on its operating income in the current quarter.

For the full year, Abercrombie tightened its earnings outlook and now expects earnings per share to be between $10.00 and $10.50. That compares with a previous range of $9.50 to $10.50 per share.

Abercrombie's guidance incorporates about $90 million in net tariff costs – nearly double what it previously anticipated. When it announced fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, Abercrombie said it was expecting a $70 million hit from tariffs that it could reduce to $50 million through mitigation.

At the time, President Donald Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs were held at 10% across most of the globe. But now Abercrombie faces higher duties on goods from Vietnam, Cambodia and India, key manufacturing regions for the company.

The company reiterated during a conference call with analysts that it is not planning broad price increases, saying higher prices are not part of its outlook.

Abercrombie & Fitch, once a forgotten mall brand, has been on a rocket ship of growth over the last few years. But the surge has started to slow at its namesake banner. On the call, Horowitz attributed the decline in sales during the quarter to old inventory that it needed to mark down to sell through, which reduced the average selling price of products. She expects the brand to be back to growth by the end of the year.

""We did take a little bit of a step back, but we are very confident in where we're headed. The brand is in great shape. Our traffic is strong,"" said Horowitz. ""We are confident we're on a path to improvement.""

In the meantime, Hollister has been fueling the overall business performance, especially with the recent launch of its Y2K assortment, which brings back some of the brand's beloved styles from the early 2000s and a touch of the old Abercrombie, including graphic tees and short skirts.

To boost growth at Abercrombie, the brand has turned to new categories, such as dresses, athleisure and bridal, to stimulate growth. It's also working to expand internationally and lean on partnerships.

On Monday, the company announced it would be the NFL's first ""official fashion partner"" – a multiyear deal that will include personal styling for athletes, athlete-led campaigns and player-designed apparel. The partnership comes after Abercrombie launched an assortment of NFL-licensed products in 2022, a category that has performed well for the company.

It has teamed up with star players like Christian McCaffrey, Tee Higgins and CeeDee Lamb to advertise the partnership and designed limited-edition co-designed apparel that will be available for sale during the upcoming season.

""Who would have dreamed a few years ago to partner with an iconic global brand like the NFL?"" Horowitz told analysts.

The partnership reflects the steps retailers are taking to ensure they can continue to grow sales and stay relevant with consumers at a time when shoppers are pulling back on nice-to-have items like new clothes and accessories. Competitors like Levi Strauss , American Eagle and Gap have teamed up with celebrities in recent marketing campaigns ahead of the back-to-school and fall shopping seasons.

Still, the slowdown raises questions about how the brand will grow in the quarters ahead, especially as competition continues to heat up, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a note.

""Better numbers ... will probably come through as the prior year comparatives start to ease, but they also need to be engineered by the company. We believe there are some good initiatives in play here, including the overseas expansion of the brand,"" said Saunders. ""Our recent channel checks at new stores in London were all positive, although we believe the stores can reach a higher potential once the consumer economy in the UK strengthens.""'

Internationally, Abercrombie's efforts to expand are paying off in some parts of the world. During the quarter, sales in its Asia-Pacific region grew 12%, while international comparable sales climbed 3%. That was offset by a slowdown in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales slid 1% and comparable sales were down 5%.

Abercrombie has also started to expand into wholesale for its Abercrombie Kids brand, which most recently launched in Macy's . The company has a very small share of the overall market, which was worth $82.1 billion last year, Saunders said.

""This leaves considerable headroom for growth,"" said Saunders. ""Expanding through wholesale is a sensible strategy: it provides relatively fast access to new customers and requires far less capital than opening additional stores – of which Abercrombie Kids still has relatively few.""

The accused would submit orders over Instacart and Shipt, which they would then accept via their stolen shopper accounts, investigators said.
By mid-2023, Target had noticed the Shipt accounts were being used to buy gift cards rather than the ordered items, which is against its terms of use.
The FBI said Instacart reported a loss of just over $16 million as a result of the fraud carried out over 5,500 compromised shopper accounts.
Shipt lost $14.3 million and had 2,215 accounts hacked.","Eight men have been accused of hacking into over 7,500 gig workers’ accounts at Instacart and Target-owned Shipt to defraud the companies of as much as $30 million, according to a search warrant and an indictment reviewed by Forbes.

It’s a rare case showing how gig workers are vulnerable to hacking at scale, which can be damaging for the tech companies who employ them.

In the court documents, filed earlier this month in Ohio and Michigan, the FBI claimed that from 2022 onwards the accused worked together to acquire a stolen list of Instacart and Shipt shoppers who were tasked with buying and delivering items to customers of the two apps. To get into accounts, the defendants posed as Instacart and Shipt employees, contacting the shoppers, some of which were inactive, to ask if they wanted to continue doing deliveries, according to the FBI’s account. The scammers asked the victims to share a one-time passcode to give them access to the account, purportedly to remove their account, reactivate it or to confirm their status as active.

But instead they allegedly used that access for a gift-card fraud scheme. The accused would submit orders over Instacart and Shipt, which they would then accept via their stolen shopper accounts, investigators said. Because user orders go to the nearest shoppers, it’s simple to engineer a task to go to a specific account. Once funds to cover the cost of the goods they were supposed to buy were available on their shopper debit cards, the defendants bought gift cards rather than the items requested, according to the FBI. Meanwhile, posing as the original customer, the swindlers cancelled the order to get a refund. Typically they used the gift cards to buy items online or acquire cryptocurrency, the government said; often, they’d exchange the crypto for cash.

“There's people who sell lists of inactive drivers from their platform. You call them and get access to their account.”

Quote from a suspect in a Justice Department search warrant

According to the search warrant for one of the suspect’s properties, the defendants used another method to get into additional active shopper accounts: they put in an order, then contacted the shopper on the Instacart or Shipt app asking to arrange a call so they could add items to the shop. This gave them the gig worker’s phone number, which they later called pretending to be Instacart or Shipt staff, again asking for the one-time passcode for the account under the pretense that a customer had complained that their profile image didn’t match the person who made the delivery, investigators alleged.

By mid-2023, Target had noticed the Shipt accounts were being used to buy gift cards rather than the ordered items, which is against its terms of use. Later, the men were seen on surveillance cameras purchasing the cards using their Shipt accounts, according to the warrant, which included the relevant phishing texts and video footage.

Meanwhile, an undercover FBI agent contacted one of the alleged scammers on Telegram, where the suspect disclosed the nature of the scheme, according to the warrant. “There's people who sell lists of inactive drivers from their platform. You call them and get access to their account. Afterwards you take the preloaded card and get gift cards,” the suspect wrote, per the warrant.

Lawyers for the defendants had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. Court dockets show the men have been charged with wire fraud but are yet to file a plea. The DOJ did not respond to a comment request.

The FBI said Instacart reported a loss of just over $16 million as a result of the fraud carried out over 5,500 compromised shopper accounts. Shipt lost $14.3 million and had 2,215 accounts hacked.

Shipt VP of communications Evangeline George confirmed the company had cooperated with police on the investigation. She said the privacy of Shipt’s members and staff is a priority.

Instacart said only a small number of its 600,000 shoppers’ accounts were compromised. “There was no breach of Instacart's systems, and we quickly detected unauthorized activity and proactively engaged law enforcement,” said spokesperson Charlotte Healow. “We’re grateful for their efforts and pleased to see the bad actors held accountable.”

It’s not the first time fraudsters have targeted Instacart’s gig workers. In 2021, the company said hackers had broken into accounts by using login information leaked online from previous data breaches. As a result of the attacks, Instacart has been adding new layers of security, including “biometric screening” where workers are asked to provide a selfie that matches their government-issued driver’s license.

As global economies grapple with inflation, labor market fragility, and shifting consumer habits, the question arises: Which retail stocks can serve as a hedge against consumer caution? The answer lies in value stocks—companies with durable business models, essential offerings, and a track record of weathering downturns.

The Retail Sector in a Slowdown: A Tale of Two Sectors

The retail landscape is bifurcated. Food retail has shown remarkable resilience, with sales growth of 3-4% in 2024 and EBITDA margins of 6-7% of sales. Consumers, facing inflation and job insecurity, have embraced ""trading down,"" opting for private-label products and budget-conscious essentials. In contrast, non-food retail—including apparel, home goods, and discretionary items—has struggled, with EBITDA margins contracting to 7-8% of sales. This divergence underscores the importance of sector selection for investors.

E-commerce, once a pandemic-era savior, now faces headwinds as growth plateaus in mature markets. Meanwhile, the rise of second-hand markets and localized brands adds complexity. Yet, within this volatility, certain value stocks stand out for their structural advantages.

Value Stocks: The Bedrock of Resilience

Value stocks in the retail sector are defined by essential products, recurring revenue streams, and robust balance sheets. These companies thrive when consumers prioritize necessity over luxury. Below are five standout examples:

1. McDonald's (MCD): The Franchise Powerhouse

Dividend Yield: 2.2%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 48 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -3% vs. -55% for S&P 500

McDonald's operates on a franchise model, where 95% of its restaurants are owned by independent operators. This structure shields the parent company from operational costs, leaving it with high-margin royalty income. During the 2020 pandemic, when dine-in traffic plummeted, digital orders and at-home dining surged, ensuring revenue stability. Its real estate portfolio also acts as an inflation hedge, with properties generating steady rental income.

2. PepsiCo (PEP): The Staple of the Pantry

Dividend Yield: 4.3%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 60 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -35% vs. -55% for S&P 500

PepsiCo's portfolio of snacks, beverages, and ready-to-eat meals ensures consistent demand. During the 2020 pandemic, at-home consumption drove revenue growth, while its pricing power allowed it to offset input cost inflation. With a BBB+ credit rating and a payout ratio of 55%, PepsiCo balances growth and shareholder returns.

3. General Mills (GIS): The Staple of the Cabinet

Dividend Yield: 4.4%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 126 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -12% vs. -55% for S&P 500

General Mills' brands—Cheerios, Yoplait, and Nature's Resource—anchor household pantries. During the 2008 crisis, its sales fell by just 0.5%, and it maintained pricing power through its diversified product mix. Its BBB credit rating and strong distribution network further insulate it from volatility.

4. Colgate-Palmolive (CL): The Staple of the Bathroom

Dividend Yield: 2.3%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 130 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -22% vs. -55% for S&P 500

Colgate's oral care and household products are non-discretionary. Its ability to offer products across price tiers allows consumers to trade down without abandoning the brand. During the 2008 crisis, its revenue dropped by less than 3%, and its BBB rating ensures financial stability.

5. Genuine Parts (GPC): The Staple of the Garage

Dividend Yield: 3.5%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 60 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -46% vs. -55% for S&P 500

As the largest automotive parts distributor, Genuine Parts benefits from the inelastic demand for vehicle maintenance. High used car prices and supply chain bottlenecks during the pandemic boosted its sales. Its conservative payout ratio (50%) and BBB rating reinforce dividend reliability.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

While these stocks offer resilience, investors must remain selective. Key criteria include:

- Essentiality: Products or services that consumers cannot easily forgo.

- Pricing Power: Ability to pass on cost increases without losing market share.

- Balance Sheet Strength: Low leverage and strong liquidity to withstand shocks.

- Dividend Sustainability: A history of consistent payouts, even during downturns.

The current macroeconomic environment—marked by rising interest rates and a fragile labor market—favors companies with recurring revenue and low debt. For example, McDonald's and PepsiCo's franchise and subscription models generate stable cash flows, while General Mills and Colgate-Palmolive's consumer staples portfolios ensure demand continuity.

Conclusion: Anchoring Portfolios in Uncertain Times

The retail sector's resilience during economic slowdowns is not uniform. While non-food retail falters, value stocks in food, utilities, and essential services emerge as safe havens. By investing in companies like McDonald's, PepsiCo, and General Mills, investors can hedge against consumer caution while capitalizing on durable demand. As the U.S. retail market navigates a softening labor market and valuation dispersion, these stocks offer a blend of income, stability, and long-term growth.

In a world of uncertainty, the best defense is a portfolio anchored in value.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:04:46.073834

Risk and Reward: A Value Investor's Perspective Kohl's revival is not without risks.","In the shadow of a struggling retail sector, Kohl's Corporation (KHC) has emerged as a compelling case study in value-driven revival. The company's 2025 turnaround efforts, marked by disciplined cost-cutting, margin expansion, and strategic repositioning, echo the principles that once transformed Hyundai into a global industrial titan under the leadership of its founder, Chung Ju-Yung. For value investors, Kohl's journey offers a blueprint for navigating distressed markets through operational rigor, customer-centric innovation, and long-term vision.

Kohl's 2025 Turnaround: A Blueprint for Retail Resilience

Kohl's second-quarter 2025 results underscore a hard-won pivot toward profitability. Gross margins rose 28 basis points to 39.9%, driven by a shift toward proprietary brands and tighter inventory management. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses fell 4.1% year-over-year, while operating income surged to $279 million—a 68% increase from the same period in 2024. These metrics reflect a company shedding the inefficiencies of its past and embracing a leaner, more agile model.

The strategic pillars underpinning this revival are clear:

1. Operational Discipline: Kohl's has slashed inventory by 5% year-over-year to $3.0 billion, alleviating overstock pressures and freeing cash flow.

2. Customer-Centric Innovation: The full rollout of Sephora shop-in-shops across all stores has created a $2 billion beauty business, while new home brands like Miryana and Mingle & Co. are revitalizing stagnant categories.

3. Omnichannel Integration: A $400 million investment in digital upgrades and return partnerships (e.g., with Amazon) is streamlining the customer journey, even as digital sales remain a challenge.

Chung Ju-Yung's Legacy: A Parallel in Values-Driven Leadership

The parallels between Kohl's revival and the leadership of Hyundai's founder, Chung Ju-Yung, are striking. Chung's philosophy of strategic frugality—prioritizing innovation over wasteful spending—mirrors Kohl's focus on inventory discipline and expense reduction. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Chung famously avoided cutting R&D budgets, instead reinvesting savings into machinery to preserve talent and accelerate growth. Similarly, Kohl's has redirected resources toward high-impact initiatives like Sephora partnerships and proprietary brands, rather than broad-based cost-cutting.

Chung's mantra of “shortening the time”—emphasizing speed and execution discipline—resonates in Kohl's 2025 strategy. Under interim CEO Michael Bender, the company has accelerated its omnichannel rollout and simplified its value proposition (e.g., Kohl's Cash), mirroring Hyundai's rapid pivots during crises. Both leaders also prioritize people-centric cultures: Kohl's has emphasized inclusion and ESG stewardship, while Chung's profit-sharing programs and worker-centric ethos built loyalty during Hyundai's rise.

Risk and Reward: A Value Investor's Perspective

Kohl's revival is not without risks. The company still faces declining in-store traffic and a high-interest debt burden (e.g., $360 million in 10% senior secured notes issued in July 2025). However, its progress in margin expansion, cash flow generation ($598 million in Q2 2025 operating cash flow), and strategic partnerships suggests a path to sustainable growth.

For value investors, Kohl's offers a compelling risk-rebalance trade. Its forward P/E ratio of 4.5x (as of August 2025) reflects skepticism about its long-term prospects but also creates a margin of safety. The company's focus on impulse purchases (30% sales growth in Q2 2025) and family-centric rebranding (“Where Families Come First”) positions it to capture underserved segments in the retail market.

Investment Thesis: A Retail Renaissance in the Making

Kohl's turnaround aligns with the principles of value investing: buying into a business at a discount while betting on management's ability to unlock intrinsic value. The parallels to Chung Ju-Yung's leadership—frugality, execution discipline, and a long-term vision—add credibility to its revival. While the road to profitability remains challenging, the company's Q2 2025 results and strategic clarity suggest it is no longer a distressed asset but a resilient contender in the evolving retail landscape.

For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, Kohl's represents a high-conviction play on retail resilience. The key will be monitoring its ability to sustain margin improvements, execute its omnichannel strategy, and navigate debt obligations. Those who recognize the parallels between Kohl's and Hyundai's historical turnaround may find themselves positioned for a meaningful return as the retailer's value proposition gains broader acceptance.

In a market where many retailers are still reeling from the post-pandemic shift in consumer behavior, Kohl's has taken a page from Chung Ju-Yung's playbook. By marrying operational rigor with customer-centric innovation, it is proving that even in distressed sectors, value can be created—and sustained.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:08:52.874038

RML is calling its Porsche 911 Turbo S-based rocket the GTH and says the Barney-colored sports car is inspired by Le Mans racers such as the Porsche GT1 of the late 1990s.
RML also prides itself on the actively-adjusting dampers fitted to the car, which the firm says provide a properly cushioned ride on the road.

Now, the firm has set its sights on the Porsche 911 Turbo-series, announcing its own take on the classic rear-engined car for the company's 40th anniversary earlier this morning.

RML is calling its Porsche 911 Turbo S-based rocket the GTH and says the Barney-colored sports car is inspired by Le Mans racers such as the Porsche GT1 of the late 1990s. The RML internal codename for this modified Porsche is P39, since it is the 39th model produced by the UK firm, and the aftermarket brand says it fulfills the mission of being the ultimate grand touring model. That is all well and good, but its on-paper performance suggests that it is really competing with supercars.

Power figures are set at a solid 920 hp from its twin-turbo 3.7-liter flat-six. Torque figures rise to 737 lb-ft, a feat that RML credits to tuning partner Litchfield Motors. Active aerodynamic features are a big help for a road-going model with so much thrust, but RML went one step further and allows the driver to select certain aerodynamic options themselves. Other performance upgrades include selectable ride height adjustment, a rear roll cage, and a rear seat delete. RML also prides itself on the actively-adjusting dampers fitted to the car, which the firm says provide a properly cushioned ride on the road.

""This is a proud day in RML history. I could not be more thrilled with how the GT Hypercar has turned out. It was an ambitious project but it has beaten even my exacting expectations on road and track. I congratulate and thank the whole RML team for making my and our customer’s dream cars come true,"" Michael Mallock, Board Member responsible for the RML's Bespoke Division, said.

The striking addition of Storm Purple paint and carbon fiber body structure are a testament to RML's bespoke capabilities, which it says are nearly limitless. We may have personally not opted to slather our fire-breathing RML GTH in purple paint, but the unusual color shows off its impressive aero kit well. Gold brake calipers and other pieces of hand-painted gunmetal trim are included to offset the boisterous body color.

The interior of the RML GTH receives a similar treatment, with retrimmed standard seats featuring Crayon-colored stitching. The seatbelts have also been color matched to complete this Crayon-inspired interior. The roll cage is predictably wrapped in Storm Purple while other essential panels get a layer of visual carbon fiber.

People are asking, ‘Does this star actually care about this brand?’,” Jones told SJ Denim.
We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.
Earlier this month, Calvin Klein unveiled its Fall 2025 denim collection with a campaign fronted by Mingyu of K-pop group Seventeen.
CEO Michelle Gass even stated during a recent earnings call that “The Levi’s brand has never been stronger.” “Gap and Levi’s share some common elements that work for them,” Labunski said.","In 2024, consumers (specifically Gen Z and millennials) went feral for celebrity-driven campaigns.

Take 32-time Grammy Award winner and global icon Beyoncé, for example. Her highly anticipated album “Cowboy Carter” not only topped the charts but also fueled a blockbuster campaign with Levi’s.

Launched in September 2024, the collaboration generated more than 4.3 billion impressions and over $65 million in estimated earned media value (EMV) by April 2025. Combined with the release of her viral track “Levii’s Jeans” last March, Levi’s reported a 12 percent boost in net revenue and a 44 percent surge in net income to $183 million by the end of Q4 2024, according to the company’s earnings report.

Country music star Lainey Wilson followed suit. Riding the momentum of her album “Whirlwind,” she dropped her first collab collection with Wrangler which became the brand’s most successful global collaboration.

Meanwhile, Charli XCX’s chart-topping album “Brat” marked a cultural reset in both music and fashion. The rule breaker revived the indie sleaze aesthetic, brought club culture back into focus and toppled Clean Girl minimalism with her simple (yet effective) lime-green album cover.

Heather Ibberson, retail analyst at EDITED tracked the ripple effect, noting “Lime green apparel arrivals were low within retailers’ Spring 2024 collections. However, we saw a 171-percent spike in June 2024 vs. 2023 when the album launched, and fans used the slime hue to signal their Brat girl status.”

Charli XCX’s influence translated into sales, too. For example, Her Skims cotton rib collection campaign reached a 35 percent majority sell-out rate—meaning more than half of SKUs sold out—within its first three months in the U.S., while her collaborations with Acne Studios generated an estimated $1.5 million in media mentions in its first 48 hours, a figure “significantly higher than other campaigns during the same period,” according to Launchmetrics data.

So, if celebrity campaigns sparked cultural moments and measurable returns last year, why aren’t they striking the same chord in 2025?

Well, according to Stacy Jones, founder and CEO of pop culture marketing agency Hollywood Branded, it’s because “consumers are savvier now.”

“Last year’s multi-collaborations felt exciting because they were fresh combinations. This year, the saturation is showing. People are asking, ‘Does this star actually care about this brand?’,” Jones told SJ Denim. “There’s a fatigue factor, but it’s also a demand for deeper storytelling. The campaigns that will resonate moving forward are the ones that go beyond a single ad and actually create experiences or narratives people want to be part of.”

If there was one campaign that showed just how tricky the formula has become, it was American Eagle’s “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” campaign.

While AE’s president and executive creative director Jennifer Foyle said the goal was to add “a little mischief” to the company’s marketing strategy, it instead sparked an online uproar.

In one video, Sweeney delivers a mock science lesson, stating “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color…my jeans are blue,” she says, playing on both the denim she’s wearing and her own blue eyes. The clip then cuts to a voiceover saying “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.”

“The creative was clever, but it lacked layers. It relied too heavily on a single pun without the cultural scaffolding that [others] have built, [leaving] it more vulnerable to backlash and interpretation instead of universal resonance,” Jones said. “The partnership wasn’t necessarily wrong…but without diversification across talent or storytelling, the weight fell entirely on her shoulders, making the campaign easier to critique.”

AI-powered geospatial insights company Pass_by reported that AE’s in-store traffic decline accelerated in the wake of the controversy. For the week of Aug. 3–9, visits were down 8.96 percent year-over-year, following a 3.9 percent drop the previous week.

That’s not to say the campaign didn’t generate attention, though.

In fact, the move actually sparked a surge in online conversation, with daily mentions of the brand jumping from an average of 67 to 33,000, according to Marketplace Analytics Platform Systems (Maps).

“This isn’t just a debate about denim; it’s a discussion about identity, belonging, power and status,” Hillary Herskowitz, founder and CEO of H2 Marketing Group, told SJ Denim. “[Consumers] continue to engage with it because controversy gives us a sense of control (especially when sharing our opinions)… but that doesn’t always translate to sales or increased foot traffic like we saw [with AE].”

With backlash mounting, AE eventually addressed the criticism in an Instagram post, clarifying that the campaign “Is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.”

But the saga didn’t end there. Today, AE announced a limited-edition collaboration with Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce—dropping just one day after the NFL star and global icon Taylor Swift revealed their engagement. The collection, which AE said has been more than a year in the making, was positioned as an extension of Kelce’s sportswear and lifestyle brand built on connection and self-expression.

Still, the timing is already drawing criticism. One TikTok user wrote, “Oh. Um… how did we go from hearing the most exciting and happy news yesterday to Travis supporting a company that ran a eugenics campaign? I’m not ok with this.” Another added, “As someone who studied advertising…these things take MONTHS if not years to come out. This is just snaky timing on AE’s end.”

“Signing on Travis Kelce isn’t so much a pivot as it is an expansion. He, no doubt, is part of the long-term effort to turn the campaign toward men’s clothing,” Baruch Labunski, CEO at digital marketing firm Rank Secure, told SJ Denim. “He is a good choice because he is a well-known football celebrity now engaged to Taylor Swift, who is incredibly popular with the target group of young women. In fact, the engagement announcement is almost too perfectly timed with the announcement of this ad campaign. Timing had to be coordinated.”

Calvin Klein (CK) is in the same boat as AE.

While the PVH-owned brand managed to avoid controversy this time—unlike its infamous 1980 ad starring 15-year-old Brooke Shields declaring “Nothing comes between me and my Calvins”—its latest effort still failed to resonate, Jones noted.

Earlier this month, Calvin Klein unveiled its Fall 2025 denim collection with a campaign fronted by Mingyu of K-pop group Seventeen. Unfortunately, the drop landed on the very same day Gap launched its headline-grabbing Katseye campaign.

“Dropping the Seventeen campaign the same day as Gap’s Katseye ad meant the attention economy was already spoken for,” Jones said. “Timing is everything, and Calvin’s push didn’t feel differentiated enough to cut through. It shows how even big brands with history can fail to spark conversation if they don’t align creative, timing and cultural context.”

Herskowitz agreed, adding that Calvin Klein has spent decades chasing the shock value of its most controversial campaigns but “keeps missing.”

“The Seventeen campaign felt like going through the motions rather than having something to say,” she said.

In contrast, Gap was striking gold.

Gap’s “Better in Denim” fall campaign starring rising global girl group Katseye was a unanimous hit.

The concept positions denim as a blank canvas for individuality and freedom of movement. All six Katseye members appear in head-to-toe denim, dancing with high energy to Kelis’s early-2000s hit “Milkshake.”

Like AE’s Sydney Sweeney ad, Gap’s campaign went viral—but this time for positive reasons.

As of today, the commercial had racked up more than 40.1 million views on Gap’s Instagram account and 3.9 million likes on TikTok, where fans are busy re-creating the dance. Launchmetrics also reported that the Katseye campaign reached an EMV of $1.7 million shortly after its launch, quickly becoming its most viral campaign.

One Instagram commenter captured the online mood: “I can’t wait to tell my children about the great denim wars of 2025,” to which another replied, “There is no war…Gap clocked AE fair and square.”

“Star power alone isn’t enough anymore. If it feels transactional, audiences tune out. Katseye work[s] because they’re believable extensions of the brands,” Jones said. “Denim is foundational in fashion, but when every brand is trying to own the same cultural spotlight in the same season, the noise drowns out weaker executions. That’s why Gap…broke through while American Eagle and Calvin Klein struggled to cut through.”

Levi’s, which recently launched a campaign starring country/pop star Shaboozey, is another brand managing to keep customers hooked.

According to Levi Strauss & Co.’s April earnings update, the company generated $1.53 billion in sales for the first quarter—up 3 percent on a reported basis and 9 percent on an organic basis versus Q1 2024. In Q2 of 2025, Levi’s reported $1.4 billion in sales and a 6 percent uplift in net revenue. CEO Michelle Gass even stated during a recent earnings call that “The Levi’s brand has never been stronger.”

“Gap and Levi’s share some common elements that work for them,” Labunski said. “Both lean on music and lifestyle storytelling rather than putting a single celebrity at the center. The ads feel authentic, and that matters—especially to Gen Z, which statistically doesn’t care as much about brands as it does about authenticity. That’s why Levi’s and Gap are connecting, while others are [struggling to get traction].”

The investor believes a fairer price would be higher, but did not specify the amount.

San Francisco, July 02, 2025 — Think Investments LP, a significant shareholder with a 10.7% stake in TaskUs, Inc. (Nasdaq: TASK), has publicly opposed the company's proposed take-private transaction with Blackstone and TaskUs' founders. The investor, which holds 3.7 million Class A shares, has raised concerns about the $16.50 per share buyout price, stating that it undervalues the company [1].

Think Investments' opposition is detailed in a presentation that outlines several key points. The investor argues that the proposed transaction price substantially undervalues TaskUs. Their analysis of relevant comparable transactions and the company's recent operating outperformance indicates that a fair valuation for TaskUs is $25.00 per share, more than 50% above the proposed buyout price [1]. Additionally, TaskUs has significantly outperformed financial expectations since the announcement of the transaction, further warranting a re-rating [1].

The presentation also highlights the skewed process that led to the proposed transaction. Think Investments believes that the TaskUs Board of Directors' Special Committee failed to undertake a comprehensive process to determine a fair price for the company. The fairness opinion appears to deliberately and exclusively include precedent transactions and public comparables with low valuation multiples [1]. Notably, the most relevant precedent transaction, the acquisition of WNS by Capgemini, was omitted from the company's valuation materials. This transaction implies a fair value for TaskUs of approximately 12x LTM EBITDA, in contrast to the fairness opinion's 6.8x median precedent transaction multiple [1].

Think Investments also contends that the transaction would prevent minority shareholders from realizing TaskUs' significant value creation potential, particularly in AI services. AI Services constitute the fastest scaling portion of the business, with 65.5% YoY growth in H1'25. Coupled with strong momentum coming out of the first half of the year, Think Investments believes the transaction's contemplated price fails to compensate minority shareholders for the Company’s intrinsic value [1].

The transaction is conditioned on approval by a majority of the unaffiliated vote, and Think Investments' opposition could impact the vote's outcome. The investor plans to vote against the transaction, believing that TaskUs has significant value creation potential, particularly in AI services, and that minority shareholders would be prevented from realizing this upside [1].

(Aug. 27, 2025) — With the start of the school season officially upon us, many families across Michigan are feeling the financial pinch with their back-to-school shopping this year as the tariff-driven costs of school supplies, clothing, and everyday essentials continue to soar. Last week, in an effort to tackle these rising prices and help Michiganians save on their back-to-school shopping list, Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) introduced legislation to implement a Back-to-School tax holiday and allow residents to claim a refund for sales and use taxes paid on eligible purchases during an annual two-week period.

“The start of the new school season should be an exciting time, but thanks to skyrocketing prices fueled by Trump’s reckless tariffs, many families across the state are instead feeling the burden of trying to afford their back-to-school shopping list on top of their already increasing everyday expenses,” said Sen. Irwin. “From helping them save on backpacks and notebooks to new shoes for their kiddos, this legislation would not only deliver economic relief that Michiganians need — it would also ensure our students are set up for success in the classroom from day one.”

With tariff-driven inflation on the rise, many major retailers, like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Amazon, and Costco, have announced their plans to continue increasing prices. And, the burden of ballooning prices is already being felt across the country, with about 20% of back-to-school shoppers saying buying supplies for the new year is straining their budgets, according to one recently released report, and a separate report showing that 39% of parents can’t afford their back-to-school shopping altogether.

Women take ~3+ years longer to reach CFO seat, and over a third follow a non-linear path to the role

Companies led by women CFOs delivered ~4.5% annualized shareholder return during their tenure

Underperforming firms have seen a 10% performance uplift after appointing a woman CFO

83% of women CFOs say automation, particularly AI, is enabling new expertise and pathways into finance leadership

75% of women finance leaders identify digital literacy and strategic leadership as important skills for the future CFO role; yet only 24% rely significantly on AI tools today.

BIRMINGHAM, Mich., Aug. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading enterprise finance management platform, OneStream, today released the findings from a global study of 1,146 finance leaders, professionals, and business executives. The research explores the measurable business value of diversity in finance leadership, the routes to achieving the CFO role, barriers women face on the path to CFO, and the accelerators that help them advance.

The report – entitled ""The Glass Chair"" -- shows that women CFOs are not only driving strong business results but are also helping shape the skills and capabilities required for the future of finance leadership. Companies led by women CFOs deliver an average 4.5% annualized shareholder return, outperforming industry benchmarks by approximately 0.2% per year across Europe, the UK, and the US.

Notably, these findings are consistent with earlier independent research from S&P Global Market Intelligence study which found that companies appointing women CFOs generated 6% higher profitability and 8% higher stock returns in the first 24 months post-appointment.

Part of the ongoing Finance 2035 Initiative, the study found that women are prioritizing the capabilities most critical for tomorrow's CFO role. Eighty-three percent of women CFOs say automation – especially AI -- is enabling different types of expertise to enter the role, and three-quarters identify digital literacy and strategic leadership as essential skills for the future.

""The data is clear: advancing women into CFO roles enhances innovation, competitiveness and modernizes a critical business function,"" said Pam McIntyre, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller, OneStream. ""At a time where CFOs are being asked to do more and navigate increasing complexity, women leaders are accelerating digital transformation, outperforming benchmarks and bringing strategic and leadership skillsets businesses need to thrive in an uncertain future.""

Broader Experience, Deeper Impact

The research reveals that women take longer and less linear routes to the CFO seat — averaging 18 years at Global Fortune 500 and 20 years in the FTSE 100. Along the way, they change roles and companies more frequently, and according to the LinkedIn analysis in the study, 35% of women CFOs in the sample group have backgrounds that reflect a non-linear career trajectory, including operating or cross-functional roles outside of core finance.

As a result, women often have a broader enterprise-wide perspective, deeper operational acumen, and stronger leadership experience for the CFO role. This positions them to balance financial strategy with people development, risk management, and cross-business collaboration — all qualities critical to the modern CFO.

Skills that Define the Future CFO

The research shows that women CFOs are more likely to align with leadership personas that emphasize financial governance, strategic planning, and team development, defined as:

The Strategic Architect – balancing long-term finance planning with executive team development

The Financial Guardian – emphasizing transparency, governance, and risk management

These qualities align directly with the skills most needed for today's CFOs, as today's finance leaders embrace AI and automation to free up capacity for strategic guidance and decision-making.

Women are also helping lead in digital adoption. Most cite (83%) that automation is enabling different expertise to enter the role, and three-quarters identify digital literacy and strategic leadership as the top skills for the future. Nearly 70% report that technology has already helped equalize opportunities, while many also point to data analytics and cybersecurity as essential capabilities for tomorrow's CFO.

The study highlights powerful opportunity: While 73% of women are eager to build AI skills, only 24% expect to rely significantly on AI tools today, according to our recent pulse survey on Finance Talent. Women finance leaders' focus on transparency, governance, and risk management offers one reason why they've been slower to adopt more generic AI toolsets, which lack the context, accuracy, and transparency required for effective financial decisions and performance. Closing this gap in AI transparency and accuracy is one of the fastest ways for women to build confidence and competence in AI adoption across finance — and an accelerant to empowering women leaders who already demonstrate competencies in other areas critical to the future CFO role.

The Rising Value of Women in Finance Leadership

While women CFOs bring the diverse skillsets, resilience, and enterprise-wide perspective that the modern CFO role demands, many cited several structural barriers that slowed their progression, despite them being capable for the CFO role. These include economic downturns disrupting organizational structures, complex workplace politics, limited access to mentorship, challenges balancing work and personal life, and skills gaps within finance teams.

These barriers delay advancement and in doing so, postpone the value businesses could be capturing sooner. Companies that prioritize breaking down these obstacles will unlock leaders who not only deliver higher returns, but also bring broader skillsets needed to steer finance into the future

About the Study

The Glass Chair study is the latest installment in OneStream's research exploring the future of finance leadership. Following the global Finance 2035 study – conducted with 1,500 business leaders and 500 investors across six countries – The Glass Chair builds on those insights with a focused examination of women in senior finance roles. Conducted between February and July 2025 in partnership with Man Bites Dog, the study combines economic analysis of more than 100 publicly traded companies, opinion research among 700 senior finance professionals across the US, UK, France, Germany, and Australia, and LinkedIn career data from 346 CFOs worldwide from the Fortune Global 500 and FTSE 100.

To enrich these findings, OneStream convened an advisory board of senior women in finance to provide context and perspectives to contribute a qualitative dimension to the research. Together, these findings offer a comprehensive view of the progress of women CFOs, the pathways to leadership and the business value of diversity in finance leadership.

The revision reflects Barclays' positive assessment of Tesco's recent financial performance and strategic direction, although operational challenges and market volatility remain factors for consideration.

The revised price target from Barclays follows an earlier adjustment in October 2024, when the target was raised from 375p to 405p.

That initial increase was spurred by Tesco’s first-half performance in the 2024-25 fiscal year, where retail EBIT and retail free cash flow surpassed consensus estimates. The robust figures prompted management to elevate its annual target for retail EBIT, signaling internal confidence in sustained performance.

On Tuesday, following the target increase, Tesco shares rose over 1%, closing at 432p per share. However, the stock has declined 0.9% so far on Wednesday, now at 428.1p.

ID20,HP Inc,2025-08-27 15:57:36+00:00,The Mercury News,Nvidia investors grapple with China risks ahead of earnings - The Mercury News,"Bloomberg, Gabriel Sama",,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/27/nvidia-investors-grapple-with-china-risks-ahead-of-earnings/,"(Bloomberg/Carmen Reinicke) — Nvidia Corp.’s China sales have taken on new levels of complexity, and investors will be hoping for a clearer read when the chipmaker reports earnings Wednesday afternoon.
Nvidia’s China revenues have been an issue since the Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips in the country in 2022.
For example, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland is refusing to put sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips, which were designed for China, back into his model.
UBS’s Timothy Arcuri says the inclusion of China sales could lift Nvidia’s forecast by as much as $3 billion.
AI Spending Clues As the biggest beneficiary of the AI craze, Nvidia’s earnings will also be closely watched for a read into spending on the technology.","(Bloomberg/Carmen Reinicke) — Nvidia Corp.’s China sales have taken on new levels of complexity, and investors will be hoping for a clearer read when the chipmaker reports earnings Wednesday afternoon.

The firm’s on-again, off-again sales in the word’s largest market for semiconductors have been a source of confusion for Wall Street. Third-quarter revenue projections for the company are roughly $15 billion apart, twice the difference between the highest and lowest estimates in the second quarter and the widest in percentage terms in at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Nvidia’s China revenues have been an issue since the Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips in the country in 2022. But they’ve been further complicated under President Donald Trump, who stopped chip sales to China in April, then reversed the order earlier this month on the condition that the US government gets 15% of the proceeds.

And now Beijing is reportedly urging local companies to avoid using Nvidia’s less-advanced H20 processors.

“It does complicate the setup,” heading into results, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager of equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “The uncertainty to me is going to be centered around if they’re able to guide to some inclusion of China-based revenues or not, and whether or not that matches up with consensus estimates.”

The back and forth over Nvidia’s China sales are causing headaches for Wall Street analysts. For example, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland is refusing to put sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips, which were designed for China, back into his model. UBS’s Timothy Arcuri says the inclusion of China sales could lift Nvidia’s forecast by as much as $3 billion.

Investors are already skittish about chipmakers’ exposure to China. Several weeks ago, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares tumbled more than 6% after the company failed to deliver a clear outlook for its Chinese sales, overshadowing generally solid guidance for the business.

AI Spending Clues

As the biggest beneficiary of the AI craze, Nvidia’s earnings will also be closely watched for a read into spending on the technology.

“Investors expect both the results and the guidance to be a couple billion better than consensus,” said Brian Colello, equity strategist at Morningstar Investment Services. “There’s so much fast money in the market, if there’s just a headline number that doesn’t live up that will likely cause a volatile reaction one way or the other.”

In addition, the report could have major implications for the broader market, given Nvidia’s stature as the world’s most valuable company. With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, it has an 8.1% weighting in the S&P 500 Index, meaning the stock has the power to swing the entire market. Options traders are pricing in a move of about 6% in either direction for Nvidia shares the day after results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Wall Street expects Nvidia to report $46.2 billion in revenue for the second quarter and adjusted earnings per share of $1.01, both up roughly 50% from the same period a year ago. For the third quarter, consensus estimates project revenue of about $53.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21.

Analysts and investors are eagerly awaiting Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s remarks on China, including the development of the B30 chip, which could replace the H20 chip. Of course, Chinese sales aren’t the biggest story for Nvidia, as demand for its Blackwell chips in other markets appears to be so strong that Nvidia could beat estimates without any contribution from the country.

That said, with the chipmaker’s stock price less than 1% from a record high and up 35% since its first quarter earnings report in May, a strong China outlook could be key to keeping the rally going.

“The overall story in Nvidia can still play out with everything else going on,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, adding that any inclusion of revenue from China is “just icing on a cake.”

Tech Chart of the Day

Chinese AI chip designer Cambricon Technologies Corp., which competes with Huawei Technologies Co. to provide accelerators for developing and hosting AI models, swung to a record profit in the first half. Its results reflect a wave of demand for Chinese chips after Beijing encouraged the use of homegrown technology in a post-DeepSeek AI boom.

Fulton for sale.","The owner of a loft office building near the doorstep to the Fulton Market District has put the property on the market with just more than a year to go before a deadline to pay off its mortgage.

A venture led by Glencoe-based investor Randy Rissman has hired brokers from Cushman & Wakefield to seek a buyer for the nine-story office building at 600 W. Fulton St., according to a marketing flyer. The Rissman venture has owned the 214,768-square-foot property at the northwest corner of Fulton and Jefferson streets since buying it for $31.7 million in late 2006, according to Cook County property records.

There is no asking price listed for the building, but it is almost certainly worth less than that amount today amid weakened demand for workspace and elevated interest rates. Despite the property's location sandwiched between a major public transportation hub and one of the city's trendiest corporate destinations in Fulton Market, many institutional investors and lenders have been wary of pursuing office deals anywhere in Chicago.

That makes it a difficult time to test the market for Rissman, who made his fortune years ago from the creation of toys such as Furby and Giga Pets. It's unclear what prompted him to put the property up for sale against that ugly backdrop, and a spokeswoman for the building's ownership did not provide a comment. But the offering comes as the Rissman entity stares down a November 2026 maturity date on a $27 million loan it borrowed from Lincoln National Life Insurance when it refinanced the building in 2016, property records show.

Sources familiar with the building said Rissman's venture is expected to receive bids close to $20 million, or under $100 per square foot. It's unclear whether Lincoln would accept a sale at a price below the loan balance, and a spokeswoman for the lender's Radnor, Pa.-based parent company said in a statement that Lincoln does not ""comment on the details of individual real estate investments.""

Several landlords of prominent downtown office buildings have explored sales ahead of loan maturities, hoping buyers might emerge at prices that would allow them and their lenders to avoid a lengthy foreclosure process. Among other examples, Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners and its lender, U.S. Bank, are both poised to endure financial blows with the sale of a 40-story office building at 190 S. LaSalle St.

Making Rissman's Fulton Street property a tougher sell is that the building is just 58% leased, according to the Cushman flyer, below the record-low 73% average for downtown office buildings. The property has eight tenants and a weighted average lease term of 4.2 years, a measurement of tenants' remaining lease commitments to the building.

Design, engineering and construction firm Epstein Global is the largest tenant, according to a source familiar with the building, with a lease for just under 43,000 square feet across the top two floors that expires in 2029.

Cushman frames the listing as an opportunity for a new owner to buy the property at a discount and lease it up, taking advantage of its proximity to the vibrant Fulton Market neighborhood and $10.5 million that Rissman's venture has poured into building renovations over the past decade.

Office properties in desirable locations with modern amenities have largely outperformed the rest of the local office market in the wake of the pandemic. The Rissman entity most recently redesigned the lobby and tenant amenity spaces in 2022, according to the flyer.

The building was originally built around the turn of the 20th century as the Sears Roebuck & Co. headquarters and distribution center and was converted into a loft office building in 1982, according to Cushman.

Rissman sold Tiger Electronics to Hasbro in 1998 for $335 million and since then has invested in Chicago real estate, among other ventures. He leads an entity that purchased the office property at 220 N. Green St. in Fulton Market for $40.8 million in early 2018, according to property records, a redevelopment mostly occupied today by co-working provider Workbox.

Another Rissman venture owns the office building at 500 Davis St. in north suburban Evanston, which it purchased for $32.3 million in 2018, records show.

The Philips Hue Play Wall Washer is a substantial upgrade for anyone running a Hue Sync Entertainment setup. Its broad, vivid gradients and impressive brightness leave the likes of the Hue Light Bar trailing, and the sculptural aluminum design actually works in plain sight. It’s not a budget product - in classic Hue fashion - and it reaches its full potential only if you’re fully embedded in the Hue ecosystem with a Sync Box or the Sync app on your TV. For those already committed though, it’s one of Signify’s most striking ambient lighting options yet.

Pros

Slick design

Fantastic lighting effects

Amazing Hue Sync performance

Great brightness and control

Cons

Premium price tag

Need Hue Sync for full experience

Ugly power brick and cable

Key Features

Three lights Individually controlled, the three integrated lights can cover a wall in colour.

Compatible with Hue HDMI Sync box Can be used in your entertainment setup.

Introduction

Signify officially unveiled the Philips Hue Play Wall Washer back in June; a compact smart lamp aimed at creating eye-catching lighting effects without taking up much space.

The Wall Washer is available in black or white, priced at $219.99 for a single unit or $384.99 for a two-pack in the US, or £169.99 / £299.99 in the UK. While this places it at the premium end of the Hue range, it comes with the ColorCast projection optics first seen on last year’s Twilight bedside lamp.

The wide-beam ColorCast system can either project gradients you set manually in the Hue app, or react in real time to whatever you’re watching or playing on a TV when paired with a Hue Play Sync Box or the Hue Sync app.

Design and build

Three light sources

Available in black or white

The Play Wall Washer is meant to be seen, not hidden. Its matte aluminum body, frosted projection window, and sculptural profile make it feel more like modern décor than a tech gadget.

The white version (tested here for this review) fits neatly into minimalist spaces, while the black variant should blend easily with darker AV setups.

Turn that slick design around and inside the frosted window are three LED modules, each angled slightly differently. These work together to create the wide, blended gradient effect that defines the fixture.

The light-facing side is elegant, but the rear is more utilitarian and not something you want on display, or even close to eye level for long periods.

Measuring 15.7cm tall and 9.1cm wide, and weighing 0.85 kg, it’s compact enough for most AV or gaming setups without taking over. Build quality is solid, though the lack of braided cables that we’ve seen on the likes of the Hue Iris is a shame. Instead it’s the regular rubberised cables, which is a bit of a disappointment, and you’ll want to hide them from view.

Power comes from the same chunky three-port adapter used with the Hue HDMI Sync Box. It can power up to three wall washers at once, which is convenient, but means multiple units need to be within reach of the same block. UK and EU adapters are included in the retail box.

Features and performance

Bluetooth or Bridge support

Compatible with Hue HDMI Sync Box

Setting up the Wall Washer follows Hue’s familiar routine. You can pair it directly via Bluetooth for a quick start, which gives access to most of the app’s color and brightness controls.

However, for the full Hue experience – including scenes, automations, and Hue Sync features – pairing with a Hue Bridge is necessary. The good news is that setup is straightforward; simply scan the QR code, connect to your Bridge, assign a room or zone, give it a name, and you’re ready in a few minutes.

Hue bulbs can also connect via Zigbee through compatible Amazon smart speakers, including the likes of the 3rd-gen Echo Show 8, Echo Hub, and Echo Show 21. This allows Alexa integration without needing the Hue skill.

Once paired, you have two main ways to use the Wall Washer – as a regular ambient smart lamp or as part of a Hue Sync Entertainment area.

In the former, the Wall Washer behaves like a standard Hue White and Color Ambiance light. You get full control over 2000–6500K white temperature, plus an expansive colour palette.

Each of the three LED modules can display different colors, allowing for instant gradient effects that look fantastic beamed onto a wall.

Brightness can be adjusted per LED or for the entire unit, or you can also use Hue’s built-in scenes and effects, making the Wall Washer a strong mood light even without media syncing.

But in order to fully maximise the Wall Washer experience you’ll want to get them setup with your Hue Sync Entertainment zone.

You can create a new Entertainment area or add it to an existing one. It will sync in real time with your content via the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box or the Hue Sync app on compatible LG and Samsung TVs (or gaming PCs).

Placement is easy with the Hue app’s 3D drag-and-drop tool, allowing you to set height, orientation, and distance from the wall.

If you pull the fixture back, you cover a wider area or move it closer for a more focused beam. Each of the three LED modules reacts individually to on-screen content, producing smooth, cinematic color transitions that are far superior to the single-zone Hue Light Bar.

It’s a fantastic effect and perhaps the best option I’ve tested so far with regards to Hue Sync-ing.

Brightness, as a regular smart lamp is superb, at 1,035 lumens in cool white at 4,000K, which is roughly double the Light Bar’s output.

With Hue Sync active, the ColorCast optics create vivid wall gradients that track games, movies, and music in real time.

The transitions are smooth, cinematic, and immersive, rather than segmented or harsh, delivering a more refined experience than cheaper competitors.

Outside of Sync, it still performs brilliantly as a standard Hue lamp, with the full 2000–6500 K range, high color accuracy (CRI ≥ 80), and access to all the usual Hue scenes and effects.

It’s also very cool how you can create your own effects, splitting the Wall Washer into three different segments and creating amazing effects on a wall. You can even edit Hue’s preset effects to have movement, ripples, flickers and the like too.

A single Wall Washer can also double as a nifty sunrise wake-up light on your nightstand. You can use the Hue app’s built-in automations to have the lamp gradually brighten and cool its colour temperature, mimicking a sunrise to gently wake you up by a specific time.

Final Thoughts

The Hue Play Wall Washer delivers on almost every front: premium design, wide gradient projection, strong brightness, and the versatility to serve as both a mood light and a reactive Entertainment fixture.

As a standalone lamp, it adds color and warmth with style. In Entertainment mode, it transforms a room into an immersive visual experience.

As is often the case with Hue, the price remains the biggest barrier. Govee’s Uplighter Floor Lamp offers a broad range of effects at a similar price, while the Lifx Luna can create a comparable wall wash effect for less than half the cost.

Neither, however, integrates with Hue Sync, meaning they can’t match the seamless, real-time syncing that makes the Wall Washer so compelling for existing Hue users.

For those already invested in Hue, this is one of the most rewarding upgrades you can add to your AV or gaming setup.",https://www.trustedreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/hue-wall-washer-hero.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:12:52.960060

His mandate is to rapidly scale and industrialise Rebl's position as the global leader in next-generation robotics.

“We're excited to partner with international companies like H&M and IKEA. Our AI-powered robots quickly step into warehouse operations, supporting a decrease in repetitive tasks for employees and an increase in overall efficiency. This game-changing technology opens new automation possibilities for sectors previously unable to leverage robotics,” says Nicholas Tengelin, CEO of Rebl Industries.

Rebl offers RaaS agreements, which the company says holds the unique advantage that customers pay for the work performed rather than the hardware itself. The robots, equipped with proprietary software, AI, and advanced sensors, can identify, pick, move, and load unsorted goods of varying sizes and packaging in real time. They feature an intuitive interface for human interaction and are part of a neural network that enables shared learning, continuously improving their performance.

Founded in 2018, Rebl Industries operates out of Gothenburg, Borås, and Skövde in Sweden. Since 2021, the company has been backed by the privately owned Pulsen Group, led by Jonus Bartholdson.

“This is just the beginning. Bringing Nicholas onboard is a major step toward building a leading robotics hub and scaling our solutions globally. With his leadership, alongside our talented team and strong partnerships, Rebl Industries is well-positioned to make a meaningful impact in warehouse robotics,” says Alexander Westerling, Co-founder of Rebl Industries and CEO of Pulsen Fusion.",https://www.mmh.com/images/2025_article/Rebl_Industries.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:06:39.072688

""In this context, the ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial,"" it said.
In line with the global shift towards diversification and strategic realignment, India is actively pursuing a diversified trade strategy to sustain its resilient trade performance, the ministry said.
Earlier this month, S&P Global upgraded India’s sovereign ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', after a gap of 18 years.

In this Monthly Economic Review for July report, the ministry said that while the immediate impact of recent US tariffs on Indian exports may appear limited, their secondary and tertiary effects on the economy pose challenges that must be addressed. ""In this context, the ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial,"" it said.

While near-term risks to economic activity, principally exports and capital formation, remain due to tariff-related uncertainties, the government and the private sector, acting in tandem and concert, can keep the disruptions to a minimum, the ministry noted, adding that setbacks eventually make us ""stronger and more agile"", if handled properly.

""If the near-term economic pain is absorbed more by those who have the ability and the financial strength to do so, then small and medium enterprises in downstream industries will emerge stronger from the trade imbroglio. Now is the time to demonstrate an understanding of national interest,"" said the ministry.

In line with the global shift towards diversification and strategic realignment, India is actively pursuing a diversified trade strategy to sustain its resilient trade performance, the ministry said. This includes the recently concluded FTA with the UK and EFTA and ongoing FTA negotiations with the US, EU, New Zealand, Chile, and Peru. ""But, these initiatives will take time to show results and may not fully address the shortfall in exports to the United States that may arise if the current tariff rates on India persist,"" said the ministry.

On the domestic front, aided by above-normal precipitation and better sowing of kharif crops, the headline inflation may remain moderate in the near term. An increased market arrival in Q1, comfortable buffer stocks and better output prospects, coupled with stable global oil markets, might keep the prices of food grain moderate, the ministry noted.

The government is proactively managing risks and seizing opportunities by strengthening domestic capacity, promoting exports, diversifying supply chains and securing alternate import sources, it added.

To enhance economic growth amidst the challenging global landscape, the creation of a Task Force for next-generation reforms aims at further simplifying regulations, lowering compliance costs, and fostering a more enabling environment for start-ups, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, the ministry said.

Second, the planned rollout of the GST reforms in the coming months, with an emphasis on reducing the tax burden on essential items, is expected to provide direct relief to households and boost consumption demand, it said. ""Complementing these measures, the rating upgrade (by S&P Global) is anticipated to reduce the borrowing costs, attract greater foreign capital inflows, widen the access to global capital markets, boost disposable income, reduce inflationary pressures, cut input costs for businesses, and support growth."" Earlier this month, S&P Global upgraded India’s sovereign ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', after a gap of 18 years.

Amid global uncertainties, these government initiatives are charting a growth trajectory driven by long-term reforms that will boost disposable income, reduce inflationary pressures, and reduce costs for businesses, the ministry noted.

The deregulation efforts by the states, such as lifting restrictions on women working night shifts and improving the ease of doing business, will further enhance productivity and stimulate economic growth, it said.

On liquidity, the ministry said that favourable financial conditions in the economy support domestic activity. ""Sufficient liquidity in the banking system has facilitated the transmission of the policy repo rate cuts to the credit markets, and the overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector has remained at almost similar levels during April-July 2025 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year,"" it said.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/08/20250827093046_Modi-Trump-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:14:08.407997

According to Barclays strategists, the collapse in volatility has spurred an “institutional equity buying spree,” lifting exposures in the U.S. above average, although analysts warn that September’s seasonality remains a headwind.

Flows have tilted toward bonds and short-duration credit as investors price in lower U.S. rates.

“As U.S. rate cut expectations gathered steam, credit and short duration inflows have picked up, with long-only (LO) and CTA positioning showing a preference for bonds over equities,” strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote.

Still, the record $7.2 trillion sitting in money market funds provides what the bank called “dry powder to keep buying dips” alongside steady buyback activity.

Strategists also pointed out that nearly half of the 2025 buyback authorizations have yet to be executed, with repurchases typically picking up in September.

They note a nascent broadening in market participation, with lagging sectors in U.S. non-Big Tech and overseas equities outperforming on Fed cut hopes, geopolitical easing and better data.

In Europe, cyclical laggards rallied on improved PMIs and Ukraine peace talks, narrowing the gap with defensives. Yet positioning in high-beta and short-cycle names remains cautious, leaving scope for further upside if momentum holds.

Rotation trends are also changing across regions. U.S. investors and CTAs have turned sellers of Europe, redirecting flows into American markets, while France has become a weak spot with outflows tied to political risk.

Domestic European investors remain the main buyers, while Germany’s inflows have moderated.

Meanwhile, inflows into Japan are holding up, and foreign demand for Chinese equities continues despite broader emerging-market outflows.

Barclays cautions that the Fed’s support could backfire if labor market conditions deteriorate. A rise in unemployment would likely slow equity inflows and risk unwinding household allocations.

For now, resilient activity data and positive earnings revisions underpin the bank’s overweight call on equities, though the analysts stress that “positioning risk is more two-sided now” given how far exposure has already risen.

They add that index volatility remains subdued, making hedges relatively cheap and providing investors with tools to manage both upside and downside risks.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEL730R1_L.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:01:55.210530

Albertsons on Tuesday named Sunil Gopinath as CEO of Albertsons Companies India, its new global technology and innovation center located in Bengaluru.

Albertsons Cos. India will serve as the grocery company’s global innovation hub, helping the U.S. and Manila, Philippines, teams collaborate on technology solutions and develop proprietary, AI- and data-driven solutions aimed at boosting the customer experience, according to the announcement. The center is run by a subsidiary of Albertsons.

Albertsons said the new center marks a strategic investment in developing scalable technology solutions to fuel the company’s growth.

Gopinath will lead the development of the Bengaluru center, which will onboard workers over the next 18 months. “Bengaluru’s rich talent pool in retail technology and thriving innovation ecosystem make it an ideal location for this journey,” he said.

In July, The Times of India reported that Albertsons employs roughly 300 people in India and is looking to hire nearly 1,000 employees in the next 18 months.

At the start of the year, Albertsons confirmed to BoiseDev that it held corporate layoffs with plans to move some roles to other countries.

Gopinath brings over 25 years of experience in building and scaling global technology operations to the CEO role. Prior to joining Albertsons, Gopinath worked at cash-back shopping platform Rakuten for nearly a decade, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has also worked for Qualcomm, Intel, eBay and Flipkart.

“[Gopinath’s] deep expertise in scaling innovation hubs and leading transformative digital initiatives makes him the ideal leader to shape our Bengaluru global capability center into a powerhouse of retail technology,” Albertsons Chief Technology and Transformation Officer Anuj Dhanda said in a statement.

Establishing a technology center in India is the latest move by Albertsons this year to bolster its operations as the company charts a new future after its failed attempt to merge with Kroger. In February, Albertsons confirmed it was undergoing a division restructuring that included combining its Intermountain and Denver divisions into a new division called the Mountain West Division. In May, Susan Morris took over the CEO role from Vivek Sankaran.

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.

The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.

Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.

Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.

The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.

In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.

The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.

Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.

The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Pennsylvania also contributed. In their conflict of interest disclosures, some of the authors reported holding equity in Workit Health.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1993772667-2048x1365-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 17:05:52.576126

Johnson & Johnson has signed a $2 billion deal to secure space at Fujifilm Biotechnologies’ Holly Springs, North Carolina, facility, as part of a larger strategy to invest heavily in U.S. manufacturing in the coming years.

The 10-year deal will expand the biopharma giant’s manufacturing capacity with a new 160,000-plus-square-foot facility, according to a news release. It will also create 120 jobs in the Raleigh area.

The investment is part of a larger $55 billion commitment to support U.S. manufacturing, technology and research and development projects over the next four years. J&J said it plans to share more expansion details in the coming months.

Dive Insight:

J&J and Regeneron will be some of the first tenants of Fujifilm Biotechnologies’ Holly Springs facility when it opens later this year.

The recent deal allows J&J to manufacture “the vast majority” of its advanced medicines in the United States to meet national demand, the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company said. J&J manufactures medicines for the oncology, immunology, neuroscience and cardiopulmonary fields, according to its website.

Currently, J&J operates 23 U.S. facilities, comprising about a third of its global manufacturing footprint, according to its 2024 annual report. The company has been building out its domestic operations as tariffs complicate international trade and more tax incentives become available for manufacturers that do business in the U.S.

“It’s hard to know what is going to happen ultimately with tariffs,” J&J CEO Joaquin Duato said during a July 16 earnings call. “But what we do know for sure is that the tax policies that just passed are already creating American jobs and driving innovation.”

The current administration’s tax law enhanced manufacturers’ ability to deduct business expenses for costs related to domestic R&D and certain production properties.

Fujifilm Biotechnologies’ Holly Springs facility will be the company’s largest cell culture biopharmaceutical facility for contract development and manufacturing organization manufacturing in North America, according to its website. Parent company Fujifilm has invested more than $3.2 billion into the project so far, with plans to bring 1,400 jobs to the area by 2031.

Earlier this year, Regeneron, a manufacturer of large bulk drugs, inked a $3 billion supply deal with Fujifilm Biotechnologies that is expected to nearly double its U.S. manufacturing capacity as tariffs stir global tensions.

Last month, President Donald Trump threatened tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical imports over the next year and a half. However, this is likely to vary by country. Most recently, the U.S. struck a deal to cap its tariffs at 15% for EU pharmaceuticals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/j1NB8WJAPwcKQOyNey7wbiuXXeYX9XjzA8rCkt_38Ok/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ib2xseS1TcHJpbmdzLU5DLUFwcmlsLTIwMjUuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-27 17:07:52.015144

The FBI says false calls are not only costly to law enforcement, but also to the mental health of those directly affected by them.

Just last week, , as well as

Over the weekend, the received a false bomb threat, and the

Monday, several similar calls occurred:

Regardless of the severity of the situation, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers says law enforcement is always ready to respond.

""You constantly get called thinking you could die on this call, and it keeps being a false alarm. You know, you never solve those issues inside you.""

The false reports at UTC and the Chattanooga Airport led to temporary lockdowns. But the affects of those calls could last for some.

Vince Champion. Regional Director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, says it leaves some fearful of what may come next.

""What is the reason? Are they just pulling a prank? Are they trying to call to get us to go to one area, so they can go do a crime in another area? Are they testing to see what law enforcement response time is?""

Champion says regardless of the reason, law enforcement must treat the call like the real deal.

""We have to respond. We have to answer. There has to be some type of response, because the one time we don't, that would be the one that would be the real one, and would cause some mass casualties.""

According to providing false information to emergency service agencies like calling in a bomb threat can lead to a prison sentence of up to 5 years.

FBI officials tell us...

“The FBI is seeing an increase in swatting events across the country, and we take potential hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk. Knowingly providing false information to emergency service agencies about a possible threat to life drains law enforcement resources, costs thousands of dollars, and, most importantly, puts innocent people at risk.""

Champion says these situations hurt everyone involved.

""I just wish people would find another way to amuse themselves other than scaring everyday citizens who are trying to live and taking cops away from doing their job.""

says these threats of violence can affect the mental health of students as well.

What’s clear is this — the need for secure, custom, and enterprise-ready software in Australia will only get bigger.","Software is no longer a back-office function — it runs everything. Banks use it to process millions of transactions, hospitals to manage patient data, and retailers to track supply chains. In Australia, the demand for strong, secure, and flexible software has only gone up.

The numbers prove it. In 2024, the Australian software market touched $15.7 billion. By 2030, it’s expected to cross $40 billion. That’s not a small bump — it’s a massive jump, driven by businesses that want custom systems, cloud platforms, and enterprise tools built for scale.

Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane are leading this shift. Global giants have set up strong bases here, and homegrown players are expanding fast. For a business, the real question is simple — who do you trust to build your software backbone?

Here’s our list of the top 10 software development companies in Australia that are shaping the digital landscape in 2025.

10 Best Software Development Companies in Australia Businesses Can Partner With

1. Appinventiv

Appinventiv is the fastest-growing software development company in Australia — and for good reason. Founded in 2015, the company has scaled to 1,200+ experts working across industries.

What they do well:

Custom enterprise software – CRMs, ERPs, workflow automation

Cloud-native platforms – built to scale and stay secure

API-first design – making systems open and easy to integrate

Advanced tech – AI, IoT, blockchain, AR/VR, metaverse

Their clients include American Express, IKEA, Vodafone, KPMG, and Asian Bank. These aren’t just logos on a deck, they’re proof of handling high-stakes projects.

Recognition has followed: Deloitte Technology Fast 50 (2023 & 2024)

Statista APAC High Growth Companies (2024 & 2025)

Clutch Top 100 Fastest-Growing Companies (2025)

Times Group “Tech Company of the Year” (2023)

Appinventiv also works with a clear process – fixed milestones, transparent updates, and agile delivery. They don’t just build software – they guide businesses through the entire journey, from consulting and architecture design to integration and ongoing support. The team is also known for aligning projects with strict industry regulations – something that matters in sectors like finance and healthcare. For Australian businesses looking to hire software developers in Australia, modernize legacy platforms, launch SaaS products, or build compliance-heavy systems – they remain a dependable partner.

2. Accenture

Accenture has been around since 1989. In Australia, they’re known for handling the big, complex stuff like government projects, banks, and healthcare providers.

Their strength lies in integration, making sure new software plays nicely with existing systems like ERPs and CRMs. Enterprises trust them because of one thing – reliability.

3. Capgemini

Capgemini mixes tech with business outcomes. In Australia, they work across retail, telecom, and finance. Their approach is hands-on, build fast, test quickly, and scale what works.

Many projects start with custom software but grow into full digital transformation programs. For businesses that want both speed and structure, Capgemini delivers.

4. Cognizant

Cognizant has a strong presence in Australia. They’re known for cloud-native builds, modernization projects, and AI-driven platforms.

Enterprises often bring them in for large transformation journeys, when the goal isn’t just “new software” but a full modernization of IT systems. Their focus is on long-term partnerships rather than one-off builds.

5. HCLTech

HCLTech is engineering-driven at its core. In Australia, they specialize in custom enterprise platforms for manufacturing, retail, and finance.

Their edge comes from applying new tech in practical ways like IoT-enabled systems, AI-driven dashboards, and scalable enterprise tools. They also stand out for post-deployment support, ensuring clients get stability alongside innovation.

6. IBM

IBM has been around for more than a century, and it remains a heavyweight in Australia. They’re not the go-to for small app, their focus is large-scale, secure, and compliance-heavy software.

Governments, banks, and healthcare providers rely on IBM when complexity is high, whether it’s hybrid cloud platforms, AI engines, or blockchain-based systems.

7. Infosys

Infosys is well known in Australia for consulting and software delivery. Their strength is process, making sure projects stay on track and bring efficiency.

They serve industries like telecom, finance, and energy, delivering custom enterprise software and modernization projects. For businesses that want tried-and-tested expertise, Infosys is a safe choice.

8. Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra blends innovation with stability. In Australia, they’re big in telecom and logistics industries that move fast and need real-time systems.

They bring in next-gen tools like 5G-ready platforms, IoT, and AI integrations. Their balance of experimentation and reliable delivery makes them a trusted partner.

9. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)

TCS is one of the largest IT companies in the world, and in Australia they play a huge role. Their strength lies in scale plus customization.

They can handle multi-country projects, yet still adapt software to local Australian needs. Energy, banking, and logistics firms often choose TCS for their ability to deliver long-term, stable software ecosystems.

10. Wipro

Wipro has been delivering IT and software services since 1945. In Australia, they’re strong in software development, cybersecurity, and cloud integration.

They also bring a sustainability-first mindset, designing platforms that aren’t just fit for today but adaptable for years ahead. That future-proofing is what makes them stand out.

Conclusion

Australia’s software industry is growing fast — and the companies listed above are at the heart of it. Some are global giants with decades of experience, while others are newer firms pushing innovation. Each brings a different strength to the table.

For businesses, the choice depends on what matters most.

If scale and reliability are critical, firms like Appinventiv, Accenture, IBM, and TCS stand out.

If innovation and speed are the priority, Appinventiv and Tech Mahindra are strong bets.

If industry knowledge is key, Appinventiv, Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro are often preferred.

What’s clear is this — the need for secure, custom, and enterprise-ready software in Australia will only get bigger. Companies that choose the right partner now will be better placed to move faster, stay compliant, and keep their systems ready for the future.",https://programminginsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Software-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:04:27.425537

Aegis is a NYC-based venture studio that partners with entrepreneurs and health systems to launch and scale meaningful healthtech startups that drive healthcare forward.

Driscoll, a veteran entrepreneur and operator, has led organizations including Walgreens Boots Alliance, Castlight Health, Medco, CareCentrix, and Surescripts. Ross, one of the nation's most respected CIOs, spearheaded Mayo Clinic's digital transformation and held senior technology roles at CVS Health and Optum. As Venture Partners, they will help Aegis surface and evaluate opportunities for new company creation and advise portfolio companies on commercialization, integration with health systems, and strategic partnerships.

""I've seen what it takes as an entrepreneur to help build great companies, and I'm excited to bring my experience to Aegis as they have built a unique model that brings entrepreneurs, novel technologies, and health systems together to create companies designed to win,"" said Driscoll. ""I'm looking forward to helping Aegis work across the healthcare ecosystem so we can improve health outcomes and lower costs for patients, payers, and health systems.""

""As a former health system CIO, I fully appreciate the importance of seamlessly integrating technology into workflows, and addressing the disconnect that often exists between health systems and the innovators working to support them, which can slow adoption and erode trust,"" said Ross. ""What drew me to Aegis is its commitment to building a bench of leaders with true domain expertise who can partner with health systems to solve their most pressing challenges. I'm excited to join this team and help extend that trust-based approach across the broader healthcare ecosystem.""

""I'm thrilled to welcome John and Cris to the Aegis leadership team. Their careers embody the values we hold most dear at Aegis: the courage to challenge inertia, the capacity to unify diverse stakeholders to drive change, and the acumen to bridge bold vision with disciplined execution. With John and Cris aboard, we are better positioned than ever to advance our mission of launching category-defining companies that transform the healthcare experience for patients and caregivers,"" said John Beadle, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Aegis Ventures.

John Driscoll has led some of the healthcare industry's most influential companies. He was CEO of CareCentrix, later acquired by Walgreens, and previously served as President at Castlight Health and Group President for New Markets at Medco, which was recognized by Fortune as the most admired company in healthcare services. Earlier in his career, he built SureScripts into the nationwide standard for electronic prescribing across pharmacies, PBMs, and health plans. Today, Driscoll chairs the boards of Waystar Corporation, UConn Health, and Magnit Global.

Cris Ross brings more than 30 years of leadership experience spanning healthcare, technology, and government. As CIO of Mayo Clinic he led an enterprise-wide EHR convergence initiative, advanced data and AI collaborations with Google and Microsoft, and scaled innovation in analytics and machine learning. Ross has also chaired the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and served on advisory committees for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Veterans Administration.

Driscoll and Ross join fellow Aegis Venture Partners Dr. Ash Zenooz, former CEO of Commure and Chief Medical Officer at Salesforce, and Dr. Steve Gipstein, former head of Worldwide Healthcare Markets at Apple. They add to a leadership team that also includes Dr. David Feinberg, Executive Chairman of Aegis and Chairman of Oracle Health, and Dr. John Noseworthy, Chairman of the Aegis Digital Consortium and CEO Emeritus of Mayo Clinic.

Since its founding, Aegis Ventures has pioneered a new model of healthcare innovation built on deep partnerships with leading health systems. Working closely with a national consortium that now includes 11 major providers, Aegis has launched and scaled five AI-powered companies tackling some of healthcare's toughest challenges — from automating workflows to accelerating clinical trials. With this proven track record and an expanding ecosystem that now includes payers, life sciences, and technology leaders, Aegis is redefining how transformative solutions are created, scaled, and trusted across the healthcare industry.

Daily rebalancing ETFs are not meant to be held unmonitored for long periods. If you don’t have the resources, time or inclination to constantly monitor and manage your positions, leveraged and inverse ETFs are not for you.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his or her investment in a single day. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in each underlying security.

One exhibition is Scott Burton: Shape Shift, a critically acclaimed exhibition surveying the seminal—and subversive—art of Scott Burton (1939-89). By the time of his death at the age of 50 from an AIDS-related illness, Burton—who once described his work as “sculpture in love with furniture”—had succeeded as sculptor, public artist, performance artist, social choreographer, art critic and exhibition curator.

This landmark exhibition spans that career, bringing together works from the 1960s to the ‘80s, including some 30 sculptures and more than 40 photographs, drawings and ephemera. The exhibition is installed on Wrightwood 659’s third and fourth floors.

The Joffrey + Ballet in the U.S., the second display, is a large-scale exhibition celebrating the history of The Joffrey Ballet and the life of Robert Joffrey. The exhibition premiered at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center in 2024, marking the first major retrospective of the company.

Highlights include rare film from the original performance of the groundbreaking ballet Astarte and Anna Sokolow’s Opus 65, as well as costumes, props, pointe shoes, posters, correspondence and other ephemera from the company and Robert Joffrey’s life.

The third exhibition is Ellen Altfest: Forever —a selection of 15 oil paintings by the U.S. representational painter Ellen Altfest, known for her painstakingly labor-intensive canvases and her observation of things in the world often overlooked in art.

Kodiak Sciences is a ""pure spec"" stock and Texas Pacific Land Corporation is not a good investment due to disappointing sales results. Cramer advises against investing in Kodiak Sciences, but notes that those who like the company should be prepared to accept the risks.

Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" shared his insights on various stocks during the latest ""Mad Money Lightning Round"" [1]. Among the stocks discussed, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) and Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) received favorable recommendations, while Kodiak Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:KOD) and Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) were advised against.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO)

Cramer highlighted Oklo as a ""buy"" recommendation, citing the company's focus on advanced fission power plants and nuclear fuel recycling technology [2]. He noted that the stock's significant gains are due to a ""pro-nuke"" administration, suggesting that the company's potential aligns with current political and regulatory trends. Oklo's stock performance has been notable, with a year-to-date gain, and the company's innovative approach to nuclear power could position it for growth in the clean energy sector.

Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR)

Cramer also recommended Carrier Global, noting that the stock is ""too low"" and advised investors to ""do some buying"" [1]. The company's better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report bolstered Cramer's confidence in the stock, with shares rising by 0.7% on Tuesday, August 26 [3]. Carrier Global's focus on technology and communications services could make it an attractive investment for those looking for growth in these sectors.

Kodiak Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:KOD)

Cramer classified Kodiak Sciences as a ""pure spec"" stock, advising caution for investors [3]. While the company posted a second-quarter loss, Cramer acknowledged that it could be an acceptable risk for those who are willing to take it. Kodiak Sciences operates in the utilities sector, which may appeal to investors seeking exposure to this sector, despite the higher risk associated with the stock.

Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL)

Cramer was not positive about Texas Pacific Land, advising against investing in the stock due to disappointing sales results [3]. The company reported worse-than-expected second-quarter sales, with an earnings per share of $5.05 falling short of analyst estimates of $5.48. Institutional investors, such as Candriam S.C.A., have increased their stakes in Texas Pacific Land, reflecting a growing interest in the company [4]. However, the stock's recent performance and earnings miss may indicate that it is not a good investment at this time.

Conclusion

Jim Cramer's insights provide valuable guidance for investors, highlighting the potential in Oklo and Carrier Global while cautioning against Kodiak Sciences and Texas Pacific Land. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

There's also in his mind,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said on Tuesday.
And the Eagles just watched Big Fred start six games in the Super Bowl season and play at a pretty high level in those starts.
“Just someone that we feel really good about having here.” The Eagles gave up a 2026 seventh-round pick to get Johnson back.
Last year, Johnson started five games at left tackle and one at right tackle.","When the Eagles had an opportunity on Sunday to bring back swing tackle Fred Johnson in a trade, they pounced.

Which might make you wonder why they didn’t just re-sign him in free agency.

“I think from our perspective, to just go, 'Why not sign him?' There's also in his mind,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said on Tuesday. “He understands that we have two All-Pro-level offensive tackles. He's in a stage in his career where he played really well and he was looking for an opportunity.

“So just because we didn't sign him doesn't mean we weren't trying to sign him. I think for him, he was looking to see what he could do somewhere else because of the situation that we had.”

Johnson, 28, signed a one-year deal with the Jaguars in March with hopes of getting more opportunity to play. And the Eagles did at least try to replace him.

They signed veterans Kendall Lamm and Matt Pryor and then after failing to draft an offensive tackle on the first two days of the draft, selected Myles Hinton and Cameron Williams in the sixth round.

But it was really clear during training camp that none of them were adequate backup options to Jordan Mailata and Lane Johnson going into the 2025 season. And the Eagles just watched Big Fred start six games in the Super Bowl season and play at a pretty high level in those starts.

“When the opportunity arose to bring him back, we jumped at it,” Roseman said. “Just someone that we feel really good about having here.”

The Eagles gave up a 2026 seventh-round pick to get Johnson back.

The Eagles first signed Johnson to their practice squad in November of 2022 and he began working with offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, whom Johnson has credited for helping save his career. After not playing much in 2023, Johnson was a huge part of the Super Bowl season in 2024.

He seems pretty happy to be back.

So much of the Eagles’ offense is predicated on leaving their tackles on islands and they don’t like to change the whole offense when a starter is out. Backup tackles are important across the league but you can argue they’re even more important in Philly.

Last year, Johnson started five games at left tackle and one at right tackle. His best performance came against the Bengals and All-Pro Trey Hendrickson, whom Johnson held without a sack or QB hit.

There’s a good chance the Eagles will need Big Fred again in 2025.

“That offensive tackle position, just like the quarterback position, you can never have too many of those guys that come in and play for you over the course of a season,” Roseman said. “We're trying to play a lot of games here. Over the course of those games, you're going to need guys to step up in back-up roles. Fred's shown he can do it at a championship level, and so just really excited to bring him back.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/08/Johnson-F-USATSI-25380594.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-27 17:07:57.231469

A setback in school fueled the idea for Mr. Fresh.
Mr. Fresh also offers branded merchandise, including T-shirts and hats, that feature a cartoon image of Danrich.
Mr. Fresh is also an acronym: Faith to Rescue Every Son from Hurt.
Getting Mr. Fresh on the shelves of Walmart is just the beginning, according to Danrich.","One of Joshua Danrich’s goals is to own a sports car dealership, which might explain the idea behind St. Louis-based Mr. Fresh—a company that specializes in air fresheners and deodorizers for automobiles as well as homes. But cars are just one facet of the 16-year-old entrepreneur’s business; the bigger mission is to show other young men that they can succeed.

After Danrich recently pitched his fresheners at Walmart’s Open Call in Bentonville, Arkansas, alongside thousands of entrepreneurs of all ages, his products earned a spot in the store’s automotive department. Now, Mr. Fresh products are available at 150 Walmart stores across Missouri, in select stores in Illinois, and also online. Danrich’s company is also partnering with Feeding America, a nonprofit, charitable organization that Walmart also supports.

A setback in school fueled the idea for Mr. Fresh. When Danrich and his mother, Shay, learned that he would have to repeat the fourth grade, Shay suggested he accept the situation and focus on something positive to rebuild his confidence.

“I came to my mom with a heartfelt position,” says Danrich, whose mother has a background as a business consultant. “I was like, ‘Mom, I want to start a business.’”

The mother-son duo took Danrich’s passion for cars and turned it into something that can enhance any vehicle’s interior: air fresheners and deodorizers.

The company now sells six types of natural, oil-based fresheners, ranging from scents like yellow rose to baby powder at $11.99 each. Mr. Fresh also offers branded merchandise, including T-shirts and hats, that feature a cartoon image of Danrich.

“I wanted everything to be just like me,” Danrich says. “And I wanted bright, bold colors so they stand out and pop.”

However, a deeper meaning lies beyond Danrich’s cartoon depiction. Mr. Fresh is also an acronym: Faith to Rescue Every Son from Hurt.

“I’m proving to the world that age is no barrier to success, and I’m inspiring youth just like me that anything is possible,” Danrich says.

In 2019, Joshua appeared on Good Morning America during one of the program’s Kidventor segments. The exposure drew new interest to Mr. Fresh products, and after returning from New York City, Danrich wanted to take things to the next level—expanding the brand’s reach and preparing it for wider distribution.

“When we got back I was like, ‘Yeah, this is serious,’” Shay says. “That’s when I knew that the brand needed to be trademarked.”

With guidance from Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, Danrich became the youngest client of its Microenterprise Program—and arguably one of its most successful. Launched in 2011, the initiative from LSEM has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs and small business owners with legal support and tools to solve business challenges.

Getting Mr. Fresh on the shelves of Walmart is just the beginning, according to Danrich.

“I want to be the biggest air freshener brand in the world,” he says. “I’m in Walmart now so you can imagine where I could be in the next four years.”

Now a sophomore at Chaminade College Preparatory School, Danrich is looking to attend the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University to further his entrepreneurial skills and study engineering. He also has dreams of becoming a motivational speaker.

“I want everyone to hear my message that anything is possible and to invest in yourself,” he says.",https://www.stlmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/4652067679185093525.webp,N,,2025-08-27 17:16:13.487521

In total, 56,389 mortgages were completed with support from the scheme during its operation, representing 1.4% of all residential mortgage completions in the UK for the period.
As the original scheme concluded, the UK government introduced a permanent Mortgage Guarantee Scheme in July, rebranded as Freedom to Buy.
The mean property value for completions through the scheme was £215,467, below the UK average house price of £271,000.
Scotland’s share of completions was notably higher than its proportion of the overall UK mortgage market.","The majority of mortgage completions supported by the government’s Mortgage Guarantee Scheme were made by first-time buyers (FTBs), who accounted for 86% of all completions between April 2021 and March 2025, according to data released by HM Treasury on Wednesday.

The scheme, which closed to new applications at the end of June 2025, was designed to help those with smaller deposits to access the property market.

In total, 56,389 mortgages were completed with support from the scheme during its operation, representing 1.4% of all residential mortgage completions in the UK for the period. The initiative allowed lenders to obtain a government guarantee on loans where the borrower’s deposit was less than 10%, provided the property value did not exceed £600,000 and the mortgage was not for buy-to-let or a second home.

As the original scheme concluded, the UK government introduced a permanent Mortgage Guarantee Scheme in July, rebranded as Freedom to Buy. The new programme aims to help homebuyers secure a property with deposits as low as 5%. Under Freedom to Buy, lenders will receive a government-backed guarantee on 91–95% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages, insuring them against a portion of potential losses. Officials expect this to encourage more lenders to offer high LTV products, supporting up to 36,000 additional mortgages for first-time buyers in the first year.

During the previous scheme’s operation, the government provided £1.7 billion in guarantees, backing £11.5 billion in mortgage lending. Properties purchased or remortgaged under the scheme had a combined value of £12.2 billion.

The mean property value for completions through the scheme was £215,467, below the UK average house price of £271,000. Most completions were for homes valued at £250,000 or less, with terraced and semi-detached houses making up the largest share at 35% and 30% respectively.

HM Treasury statistics also indicated that 42% of households using the scheme had incomes up to £50,000, with a median household income of £53,711. Households earning above £80,000 represented 18% of completions.

Regionally, 71% of completions took place in England, followed by Scotland at 21%, Wales at 5%, and Northern Ireland at 3%. Scotland’s share of completions was notably higher than its proportion of the overall UK mortgage market.

AXA Mansard Insurance has urged operators to support the Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025 through disciplined execution.

The company made the appeal in a statement issued in Lagos on Tuesday by its Chief Client Officer, Rashidat Adebisi.

Adebisi said that restoring trust and deepening industry growth required credible implementation beyond policy announcements.

She noted that industry credibility would not be judged by balance sheet size alone but by the number of Nigerians adequately protected through insurance.

She described recapitalisation and the risk-based capital framework under NIIRA as a historic chance to reposition Nigeria’s insurance industry.

However, she cautioned that capitalisation or digitisation reforms without effective execution would neither enhance customer experience nor strengthen investor confidence.

Adebisi recalled the 2004 banking recapitalisation which cut the number of banks from 89 to 25, while tripling capitalisation and improving public confidence.

She urged the insurance industry to replicate such transformation for sustainable growth.

“The NIIRA presents our industry with an opportunity to support Nigeria’s one trillion dollars economy by addressing demand, supply, and operational challenges,” Adebisi stated.

She explained that the framework empowers insurers to enhance service delivery, improve customer confidence, and strengthen trust.

On the risk-based capital framework, Adebisi described it as “primarily a customer protection tool, and secondarily a regulatory tool”.

She said aligning capital buffers with underwriting risks would enforce better product design, pricing discipline, and prudent investment, assuring stronger policyholder protection.

Responding to consolidation concerns, Adebisi said mergers should be seen as renewal for a stronger industry, not as loss.

She explained that consolidation would enable insurers to invest in technology, speed up claims, widen distribution, and compete regionally.

Adebisi lamented Nigeria’s insurance penetration remained below one per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

She compared this with 17 per cent in South Africa, three per cent in Kenya, and two per cent in Ghana, noting Nigeria’s figure was still weak.

“If NIIRA is well executed, insurance can unlock long-term funds for infrastructure, provide MSME cover, and boost investor confidence,” she said.

She emphasised that MSMEs represent over 90 per cent of Nigerian businesses, making their protection essential for national growth.

“Regulators have provided the framework. It is now up to us, the operators, to rebuild trust, embrace digitisation, and deliver inclusive products,” she said.

Analysts expect the Palo Alto, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at 75 cents per share, down from 83 cents per share in the year-ago period. HP projects to report quarterly revenue of $13.71 billion, compared to $13.52 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

With the recent buzz around HP, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, HP offers an annual dividend yield of 4.29%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of 29 cents per share ($1.16 a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $139,696 or around 5,172 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $27,928 or around 1,034 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.16 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.16 = 5,172 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.16 = 1,034 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

View more earnings on HPQ

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

HPQ Price Action: Shares of HP fell 1.8% to close at $27.01 on Tuesday.

On May 28, HP reported worse-than-expected second-quarter adjusted EPS results and issued third-quarter adjusted EPS guidance below estimates.

Headline Takeaway: Ralph Lauren's stock is under pressure, down -2.96% recently, despite a generally optimistic analyst outlook. The technical indicators, however, suggest caution with a weak internal diagnostic score of 3.95 (0-10).

News Highlights

Walmart's Agentic AI Strategy: Walmart unveiled plans for personal shopping agents powered by agentic AI, signaling a shift in retail innovation. While not directly tied to Ralph Lauren, the trend reflects broader shifts in consumer engagement and could influence competitor strategies.

Nykaa's Retail Expansion: Nykaa, an e-commerce player in India, expanded its retail footprint significantly with 50 new stores. While unrelated to RL, it highlights ongoing investment in physical retail by fashion brands, which could pressure Ralph Lauren to maintain its omni-channel strength.

Modine's Acquisition: Modine acquired L.B. White, a heating solutions company, in a $112 million deal. While not related to fashion, such strategic moves highlight capital allocation trends that investors might consider when evaluating Ralph Lauren's own initiatives and capital efficiency.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The analyst community remains cautiously optimistic about Ralph Lauren. The simple average rating is 4.30, while the performance-weighted rating is higher at 5.25, suggesting that the higher-rated institutions have shown stronger historical performance. However, there is notable dispersion in ratings—despite 10 total predictions in the last 20 days, the ratings span from ""Strong Buy"" to ""Buy,"" indicating mixed views on timing and entry points.

These analyst scores are out of step with the recent price trend, which has been negative (-2.96%), showing a mismatch between expectations and current market sentiment.

Key Fundamentals and Model Scores

Gross Profit Over Assets (GPOA): 16.99% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

EV/EBIT: 93.87 (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 8.57% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Cash Conversion (UP): -106.24% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Cash Ratio (MV): -151.21% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Asset Turnover (MV): -87.95% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

Profit Turnover (MV): -88.00% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

Revenue Turnover (MV): -14.32% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

Income Tax / Total Profit: 21.79% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

These mixed scores highlight that while some fundamentals are healthy, others—like cash and asset turnover—indicate inefficiencies. The overall fundamental score is 4.47 (internal diagnostic score), showing moderate strength.

Money-Flow Trends

The fund-flow analysis reveals a mixed picture. Large investors are trending negative (block trend negative, score 7.79—internal diagnostic score), but small retail investors remain cautiously optimistic (small trend positive). The overall inflow ratio stands at 49.36%, suggesting that while money is flowing in, it's not overwhelming. Notably, medium-sized flows are positive, while large and extra-large flows show negative sentiment, signaling caution among institutional players.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Ralph Lauren’s chart is concerning. With an overall trend described as “weak” and a score of 3.95 (internal diagnostic score), the recent signals include:

Williams %R Oversold: Score: 3.8 (internal diagnostic score). This is a bearish signal, suggesting potential for a rebound, but it has historically led to -0.03% average returns and a 55.17% win rate—so caution is warranted.

Marubozu White: Score: 1.61 (internal diagnostic score). This is a very weak signal, indicating indecision. Historically, it has resulted in -1.48% average returns and a 41.67% win rate—another bearish sign.

Recent chart patterns are clustered around the 2025-08-25 date, where both Williams %R Oversold and Marubozu White signals were detected. This suggests a period of consolidation and weak momentum. The technical insight notes that bearish signals (2) are dominant over bullish ones (0), and the trend is not clear, suggesting the stock is in a volatile and uncertain phase.

Conclusion

Ralph Lauren faces a mixed landscape. Analysts are generally optimistic, but the technical and fundamental indicators suggest caution. The weak technical signals (3.95 internal diagnostic score) and negative cash and asset turnover trends point to a stock that is struggling with internal efficiency and momentum. The recent price decline (-2.96%) further underscores this.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:13:56.578588

SMS to ugrade hot strip mill with inductive heating

The new inductive heating system, which will come fitted with heat insulation hoods, will be installed upstream of the finishing mill entry section

US steelmaker ArcelorMittal Calvert has placed an order with SMS group to modernise its hot strip mill (HSM) in Calvert, Alabama. The 2,050mm HSM was supplied by SMS group and started operation in 2010. ArcelorMittal Calvert plans to enhance the HSM to roll ‘state of the art’ steel grades and advanced hot strip products, while at the same improving rolling efficiency. SMS will ensure the smooth integration of the inductive heating system into the HSM, including the extension of the automation system.

The new inductive heating system, which will come fitted with heat insulation hoods, will be installed upstream of the finishing mill entry section. As a system solutions provider, SMS will deliver an advanced guiding and protection concept, including an entry-side wiper roll unit, two entry roller tables with side guides, inductive heating system, exit-side roller table with side guide, and exit-side wiper roll unit.

The inductive heating system is designed to heat the transfer bars to the required temperature and will ensure optimised downstream processing. The temperature of the transfer bar will be homogenised over its width and length within a tight tolerance range.

To ensure homogeneous heating of the transfer bar, including the strip edge area, the Elotherm inductive heating technology package includes a combination of both longitudinal flux inductor (LF) and transversal flux inductor (TF), thus guaranteeing maximum efficiency. The inductive heating system to be supplied to ArcelorMittal Calvert consists of four longitudinal and two transversal flux inductors. Moreover, the system can be retracted — moved in and out of the line — providing not only for production flow flexibility but also for safe and easy maintenance. With each heater having a nominal output power of 4.8MW, the inductive heating system is ultra-efficient.

A key element of the success story of the HSM at ArcelorMittal Calvert is the X-Pact electrical and automation system. It underscores the fruitful and longstanding collaborative partnership between ArcelorMittal Calvert and SMS since the original delivery of a complete electrical and automation equipment package, which was commissioned back in 2010. This was followed in 2018 by the integration of a transfer bar cooler.

Currently ongoing activities include the gradual upgrade of the L1 automation hardware for the HSM, scheduled to be completed in 2027. By then, ArcelorMittal’s personnel will be fully trained and more than ready for when the induction heating project comes on-stream. All the mechanical equipment for the Elotherm inductive heating system will be pre-assembled and function-tested in the SMS workshops prior to delivery. This provides the best possible preparation for a smooth final assembly and commissioning.

The project schedule was designed to minimise disruption to production. Where possible, the construction of the new equipment will take place in parallel with ongoing operations. The start of hot commissioning is scheduled for the end of November 2026.

All Kinds Of Additional Power The new G-Power G4M Bi-Turbo convertible was recently posted to the tuner's social channels.
Interestingly, the social posts from G-Power for this convertible G4M Bi-Turbo claim it only makes 700 horsepower, which isn't an upgrade level listed on its website.
Other Goodies Included The website says the G4M Bi-Turbo package also includes a Deeptone stainless-steel exhaust setup with carbon fiber tailpipes.

G-Power already has a wild upgrade package for the current G82 generation of the BMW M4 coupe, which throws a wall of carbon fiber at the car along with engine upgrades and interior goodies. Now, the company has taken the top off and will offer a G83 convertible version, boasting supercar performance in a rather subtle package.

All Kinds Of Additional Power

The new G-Power G4M Bi-Turbo convertible was recently posted to the tuner's social channels. In the pictured configuration, the donor M4's 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six gas engine has been remapped to a whopping 700 horsepower, up from 480 to 530 horses normally, along with 627 lb-ft of torque. However, G-Power's website also lists a few other ""Bi-Turbo"" setups, including outputs of 620, 670, or 720 horsepower. The claimed top speed for the most powerful setup reaches a ridiculous 205 mph for a convertible.

Interestingly, the social posts from G-Power for this convertible G4M Bi-Turbo claim it only makes 700 horsepower, which isn't an upgrade level listed on its website. It's possible it's the same as the coupe's ""720"" setup, just with changes for the different convertible body.

Other Goodies Included

The website says the G4M Bi-Turbo package also includes a Deeptone stainless-steel exhaust setup with carbon fiber tailpipes. There are forged 20- or 21-inch wheels available with Michelin rubber, a Venturi hood replacement, and a carbon rear wing. The company promises the mods are completely street legal. There are also swaths of carbon fiber throughout the interior, with a special carbon steering wheel with integrated LEDs as an option.

You have the option of leaving exterior carbon panels exposed or painted, and it looks like you aren't stuck with the orange wheels in the images if you want something a little less flashy. The car naturally comes adorned with plenty of reminders that G-Power has had their hands on it, with a unique orange engine cover, replacement badging of the traditional BMW roundels, and little marques throughout the cabin and on the usual trunklid spots.

But It Ain't Cheap

Pricing for the lowest G4M Bi-Turbo 620 tune and setup will set you back at least $30,000 for the upgrade alone, converting from Euros to US currency. The 670 pack is $34,750, and the big 720 tune pack is a whopping $41,500. Once you factor in approximately $85,000 to buy the actual car, the total price jumps in a hurry. But again, you're getting supercar performance figures in a classic BMW convertible package, which is probably amazing to listen to, and more importantly, amazing to drive.

If you don't want any of the three available so-called ""Bi-Turbo"" packs, you can also mix and match other upgrades as you see fit. G-Power offers tunes at various levels, including outputs of 600, 650, and 700 horsepower. Finally, there's a very orange full-leather interior upgrade package on the site, though it suspiciously says that pricing is inquiry only, so it's more likely a very custom affair tuned to the tastes of the customer.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/g-power-g4m-bi-turbo-bmw-m4-convertible-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:07:05.132151

Younger demographics often show bigger uplifts in purchase intent, while older groups lean toward positive brand perception.","For years, out-of-home (OOH) advertising was measured by audience size and impressions. Easy to report, yes – but those numbers only tell us who might have seen an ad, not whether it connected or drove any shift in awareness, perception or intent.

Attribution changes the game. It measures how many people not only saw a campaign but remembered the right brand. It asks a far better question than reach ever could: not “how many passed by,” but “how many remembered us.”

Measuring OOH has always been tricky. Billboards and forecourt screens don’t live in closed, trackable feeds like digital display ads. But tools have caught up. Advances in mobile data, programmatic digital OOH (pDOOH) and cross-channel analytics now reveal how exposure drives behaviour across the funnel, from recall and recognition to consideration and purchase.

Success isn’t about who sees your ad. It’s about who remembers it

Brand lift studies show how powerful OOH can be when creative, format and placement align. One of Tractor Outdoor’s static OOH campaigns for a leading e-commerce brand, built around a single high-traffic site in Cape Town with clean creative, achieved a +17-point lift in brand attribution and 55% ad recall, which is among the best global benchmarks. The lesson is simple: strategic sites, clear messaging and repeated exposure embed brands in memory.

Digital formats add another layer. Tractor’s programmatic campaign for a software brand delivered a +37-point uplift in brand image and +32 in ad likeability, showing how dynamic delivery and real-time optimisation deepen resonance. By reaching the right people at the right moment and adjusting mid-flight, pDOOH combines OOH’s visibility with digital precision.

Attribution also highlights the unique roles of different formats. Large-format DOOH captures attention and builds brand visibility, often outperforming benchmarks for recall. Proximity placements near points of sale, like forecourts, are especially effective for influencing purchase decisions – one snack brand campaign saw a +34 uplift in consideration among 18-34-year-olds.

We’ve seen that static OOH builds long-term brand presence, while DOOH adds flexibility, fine-tuning frequency and context for efficiency. Used together, these formats deliver both reach and impact.

Attribution reveals what works and where to go next

At Tractor Outdoor, attribution insights inform every stage of planning. We use data to understand which formats and environments consistently shift perception or intent, applying those learnings to media mix, site selection and creative refinement. Sometimes, the fix is as simple as making the logo more prominent or reinforcing distinctive brand cues. These small tweaks can have measurable impact.

It also deepens understanding of audiences. Younger demographics often show bigger uplifts in purchase intent, while older groups lean toward positive brand perception. These insights shape campaigns that speak differently to different segments, ensuring every placement works harder.

Challenges remain. Consumers move fluidly between channels, making OOH’s role harder to isolate. Data quality and inconsistent benchmarks complicate comparisons. But these are opportunities, not barriers.

By combining mobility analytics, surveys and behavioural data, we’re building a fuller view of how outdoor media influences the wider journey – and that journey is becoming more dynamic every day. Programmatic DOOH is shifting attribution from retrospective reporting to real-time optimisation. Soon, campaigns will adapt mid-flight based on live attribution signals, reallocating spend, refining creative and amplifying what works. Advances in mobile data, AI and modelling will push this further, showing not just whether the campaign worked but which message, screen or moment drove the strongest result.",https://biz-file.com/c/2508/785166.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:13:44.077729

Insurance stakeholders have called on operators in Nigeria to back the landmark Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025 with disciplined execution, stressing that the credibility of the sector will be judged not by the size of balance sheets but by how many Nigerians and businesses it can protect.

Speaking in a televised interview, Rashidat Adebisi, chief client officer at AXA Mansard Insurance Plc, described the NIIRA Act as a historic opportunity to reposition the sector.

However, she warned that reforms on paper would amount to little without operational discipline and customer-centred execution.

“Recapitalisation and risk-based capital standards create the right foundation, but capitalisation alone will not improve customer experience nor boost investor confidence. Execution is what will transform this industry,” Adebisi noted.

The NIIRA 2025 raises capital requirements significantly: life insurance operators must now maintain a minimum of ₦10 billion (up from ₦2 billion), general insurers ₦15 billion (up from ₦3 billion), while reinsurers must hold at least ₦35 billion (up from ₦10 billion).

Adebisi explained that these thresholds will likely shrink the number of players in the industry but leave behind more resilient institutions. According to data from NAICOM, about 46 percent of insurers already meet the requirements.

“I anticipate a slightly smaller industry but one that is more stable, resilient, and better able to support clients. Beyond stronger balance sheets, recapitalisation should ensure insurers create real safety nets for corporates, SMEs, government, and individuals,” she said.

She added that consolidation, mergers and acquisitions, and new investment flows could mirror the experience of Nigeria’s banking and pension sectors, where stronger institutions emerged after recapitalisation drives.

Both Adebisi and other industry leaders stressed that NIIRA’s provisions on compulsory insurance enforcement, policyholder protection, and digitisation are as crucial as the capital hike.

“Compulsory insurance is not just about collecting more premiums. It is about consumer protection. We must not leave the government alone to shoulder the burden of unexpected events,” Adebisi emphasised.

She noted that Nigerian insurance penetration remains below one percent despite decades of market potential, partly because of affordability barriers, weak consumer trust, and cultural perceptions such as “God is my insurance.” With NIIRA, she said, the industry has a chance to shift that narrative through stricter enforcement of claims payment, transparent pricing, and value-based conversations with customers.

Digitisation, she argued, is central to that transformation. “The world is digital. The insurance industry must adapt. From valuation of assets to claims transparency, technology is how we can prove value and build trust.”

The Act also aligns with the government’s ambition of positioning insurance as a key pillar of Nigeria’s proposed $1 trillion economy by 2030. Adebisi pointed to the Nigerian Insurance Association’s (NIA) innovation hub as an example of how the sector is already moving in that direction.

“Imagine all of this coming together at the right time—recapitalisation, digitisation, compulsory insurance, policyholder funds. Insurance can then become a very strong pillar of Nigeria’s trillion-dollar economy ambition,” she said.

Also speaking on the NIIRA, Akinjide Orimolade, chief executive at Stanbic IBTC Insurance, described the Act as timely and transformative. He emphasised that its provisions will improve consumer protection, restore confidence, and give insurers the financial muscle to pay claims promptly.

“Why are we in business? It is to pay claims, and not just pay but pay on time. With this new capital base, companies can settle claims as due and that builds trust in the market,” Orimolade said.

He explained that the recapitalisation drive will not only enhance insurers’ balance sheets but also allow them to take on larger risks in critical sectors such as oil and gas, construction, and power—areas previously ceded to foreign insurers.

The new law also mandates insurers to set aside 0.25 percent of gross premium income as policyholders’ funds, a development he said would further strengthen governance, accountability, and customer satisfaction.

Enforcement and inclusion

Orimolade highlighted NIIRA’s empowerment of the regulator, NAICOM, to enforce compulsory insurance policies across motor, building construction, public buildings, and group life schemes for organisations with more than three employees.

He stressed that enforcement, alongside financial inclusion, would expand insurance reach across Nigeria. “It is not just about big players. There is space for microinsurance and takaful to serve low-income segments. With risk-based capital, smaller operators can focus on niche areas while still contributing to overall penetration.”

Technology as a driver

Both experts agreed that digitisation will be a game-changer, not only in onboarding customers but also in claims settlement. Orimolade noted that technology investments—enabled by higher capital—will make products more accessible and affordable, while ensuring transparency in service delivery.

“With robust digital platforms, onboarding becomes seamless, e-KYC can be done easily, and claims can be paid faster. That simplicity will change how Nigerians see insurance,” he said.

Looking ahead, Adebisi predicted a leaner but better-capitalised industry with deeper digital integration, stronger enforcement, and improved customer solutions.

“I expect deeper market penetration, improved consumer trust, and stronger resilience for businesses and individuals. This recapitalisation is not just about money—it is a recipe for trust,” she stated.

Adebisi, however, stressed that financial recapitalisation alone will not transform the industry. She highlighted the importance of awareness and sustained engagement, noting that greater education and industry-wide sensitisation are critical to unlocking the sector’s potential.

Orimolade agreed, adding that the reforms position Nigerian insurers to “collaborate, innovate, and ultimately become credible global players.”",https://businessamlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Rashidat.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:01:00.853427

In today’s fast-paced financial markets, technology and consulting companies hold significant influence on global stock exchanges. Among these giants, Capgemini stands out as one of the leading IT services and consulting firms. Founded in 1967 in France, Capgemini has grown into a multinational leader specializing in digital transformation, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and IT consulting services. The company is listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: CAP), and its stock performance attracts both institutional and retail investors across the world. Understanding the dynamics behind the Capgemini share price is essential for investors who want to make informed decisions.

Capgemini Share Price Overview

The Capgemini share price has historically reflected the company’s strong fundamentals and its ability to adapt to technological changes. Over the past decade, Capgemini’s stock has delivered steady returns, driven by consistent revenue growth, strategic acquisitions, and expansion into high-demand areas such as cloud services, cybersecurity, and AI-driven business solutions.

For investors, Capgemini is often seen as a balanced stock it offers stability due to its global presence and long-standing reputation, while also providing growth opportunities through innovation and expansion in emerging markets.

Key Factors Driving Capgemini Share Price

1. Financial Performance and Earnings Reports

Capgemini’s quarterly and annual results significantly impact its share price. When earnings exceed analyst expectations, the stock usually experiences a positive rally. Conversely, weaker margins or revenue dips can trigger short-term corrections.

2. Global IT Spending Trends

The global IT services market continues to expand as companies across industries invest in digital solutions. Capgemini benefits directly from this trend, as its services are aligned with enterprise demand for automation, AI, and digital consulting. A rise in IT budgets often translates to growth in Capgemini’s share price.

3. Innovation and Strategic Acquisitions

Capgemini has consistently strengthened its portfolio through acquisitions, most notably its purchase of Altran, which expanded its engineering and R&D capabilities. This has reinforced its leadership in next-generation services, giving investors more confidence in long-term share price appreciation.

4. Macroeconomic Environment

Like other global companies, Capgemini is affected by economic cycles, inflation trends, and interest rate changes. During times of strong global economic growth, the demand for IT consulting rises, positively influencing the Capgemini share price. On the other hand, economic slowdowns may temporarily reduce investor confidence.

5. Competition in the IT Consulting Sector

Capgemini operates in a competitive industry alongside Accenture, Infosys, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Any shift in client market share or major deal wins can impact its stock performance. Investors often monitor how Capgemini positions itself against these rivals to assess long-term strength.

Historical Performance and Market Sentiment

Capgemini’s stock has shown resilience over the years. Even during global uncertainties, such as the pandemic and economic slowdowns, the company managed to deliver revenue growth by adapting to client needs in cloud computing and remote digital solutions. This adaptability has built strong investor confidence, contributing to consistent upward momentum in its share price.

Analysts note that Capgemini’s focus on AI, digital transformation, and sustainability initiatives has positioned it as a future-ready company. Market sentiment remains largely bullish, especially as enterprises continue shifting toward technology-driven solutions.

Is Capgemini a Good Investment?

For long-term investors, Capgemini is often considered a safe yet rewarding investment option. Its solid financial base, wide client network, and innovative strategies make it appealing for portfolio diversification. Unlike highly volatile tech startups, Capgemini offers a mix of stability and moderate growth potential.

However, short-term investors should be cautious. Like any stock, the Capgemini share price can fluctuate due to quarterly results, currency exchange rates, or global market downturns. Therefore, monitoring earnings updates and global IT spending trends is crucial before making entry or exit decisions.

Future Outlook of Capgemini Share Price

The future of Capgemini looks promising, with analysts expecting steady revenue growth supported by:

Artificial Intelligence & Automation: Increasing adoption of AI-driven business solutions.

Cloud Computing Services: Enterprises accelerating their migration to cloud platforms.

Engineering & R&D Services: Expansion through Altran and other acquisitions.

Sustainability and Green Tech: Rising focus on eco-friendly IT solutions, which appeals to ESG-focused investors.

If Capgemini continues to execute its growth strategy effectively, its share price could see long-term appreciation. Investors with patience may benefit significantly as digital transformation accelerates worldwide.

Conclusion

The Capgemini share price serves as a reflection of both the company’s strong fundamentals and the broader global IT landscape. With its consistent financial performance, focus on innovation, and strategic acquisitions, Capgemini has positioned itself as a reliable stock in the technology sector. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term trajectory for Capgemini looks strong, making it a solid choice for investors seeking stability combined with growth opportunities.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/68aeb97d9fa938001e42e952.png",N,,2025-08-27 17:04:31.924130

Negative imagery (itchy, dry, flaky skin) is primarily depicted using black models, while positive, healthy skin is shown on a white model.
The portrayal of skin conditions on black models taps into harmful stereotypes about ""dry/ashy"" black skin, which can be a source of embarrassment or shame.
The ad's production choices (close-ups, exaggerated scratching, harsh color grading) amplify distress on black skin and position white skin as the ideal.
The ad could have been less offensive if the same model or a more balanced, diverse cast was used throughout.","The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) decision to uphold two complaints against Colgate-Palmolive's TV ad for Sanex Skin Therapy (20th August 2025) would suggest that even when advertisers try to be inclusive, with diverse casting, they often end up being found to have caused serious or widespread offence.

For those who missed the lather-splattered headlines, the ad opened on two black women, their skin depicted as cracked or clawed by invisible fingernails. Cue the solemn voice-over: ""To those who scratch day and night..."". Thirty seconds and one patented amino-acid complex later, we cut to a white woman luxuriating under a steamy shower while the voice-over promises ""24-hour hydration feel"" and on-screen text reassures us that ""RELIEF COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A SHOWER"".

The ASA decided that far from cleansing the nation's epidermis, the ad had washed up an offensive racial stereotype. By juxtaposing uncomfortable, problem skin exclusively with darker tones and revealing healthy, hydrated derma only once the palette had lightened, the spot all but scribbled ""before = black, after = white"" across the nation's flatscreens. Two complaints were enough to get the watchdog scratching an itch of suspected discrimination. Having inspected the evidence under its regulatory magnifying glass, the ASA concluded the execution breached BCAP Code rule 4.2 for being likely to cause serious or widespread offence on grounds of race. In short: Sanex tried to sell inclusivity, but the message left viewers feeling distinctly excluded.

Colgate-Palmolive and Clearcast argued that the ad merely dramatised dryness and itching in a stylised way, that nobody's melanin was meant to be the punch-line, and that diversity boxes had been faithfully ticked. The ASA was having none of it. Intent, meet Impact: one can be squeaky-clean, but the other can still leave a nasty mark on the bathroom tiles.

Sanex: scratching the surface of stereotypes.

To be honest, when I first watched the ad, I wasn't sure why it would cause so much offence. I therefore asked three colleagues who are black for their opinion. Two are female, one is male, and all three are in their twenties and either qualified solicitors or training to be a solicitor. Their responses fascinated me, serving as a reminder that if you are not a member of a specific group that is subject to discrimatory treatment, it's difficult, if not impossible, to really understand the impact of certain tropes. These were their observations:

The ad's opening scenes are abrupt and jarring, with harsh lighting and dramatic music, creating a negative and unsettling effect.

Negative imagery (itchy, dry, flaky skin) is primarily depicted using black models, while positive, healthy skin is shown on a white model.

The portrayal of skin conditions on black models taps into harmful stereotypes about ""dry/ashy"" black skin, which can be a source of embarrassment or shame.

The contrast between the suffering of black models and the calm, pristine appearance of the white model reinforces problematic before/after and aspirational dynamics.

The ad's production choices (close-ups, exaggerated scratching, harsh color grading) amplify distress on black skin and position white skin as the ideal.

The ad could have been less offensive if the same model or a more balanced, diverse cast was used throughout.

All three agree the ad was insensitive and offensive, and support the ASA's decision to intervene and recommend re-editing.

The ruling is more than a slap on the wrist with a damp loofah. First, it reaffirms that the ASA will not hesitate to pour cold water on executions that place protected characteristics on the wrong side of a ""before/after"" divide - no matter how inadvertent the slight. Second, it reminds creatives that diversity isn't a palette you can dip into selectively: representation without equitable portrayal is just window dressing (or, in this case, shower-screen dressing). Finally, it highlights that even a brand whose entire USP is ""healthy skin for everybody"" can trip over its own strapline if the visual grammar sends a different signal.

Will Sanex sales nosedive? Unlikely. Controversy, like exfoliation, can paradoxically leave brands looking brighter in the short term. But the longer-term residue can be harder to rinse away. Consumers have elephantine memories when it comes to campaigns that suggest their skin - literal or metaphorical - needs ""fixing"" more than the next person's.

So what should advertisers take into the next creative brainstorm (along with the biscuits and the mood boards)?

Check your ""before"" pictures. If the problem is always illustrated by the same demographic, your ""after"" won't save you.

Interrogate your palette. The camera never lies, but it can certainly imply. Ask whether the grading, lighting or model sequence creates an unintended hierarchy.

Diversity does not equal immunity. A mixed cast isn't a get-out-of-ASA-jail-free card. It's only stage one.

Meanwhile, somewhere at Colgate HQ, an emergency team is probably story-boarding a follow-up spot featuring a rainbow of skin tones, each glowing like freshly waxed marble. My humble suggestion: perhaps ditch the ""before/after"" trope altogether and celebrate real-world skin exactly as it shows up - cracked, smooth, freckled, melanin-rich, melanin-light and everything in between. Your product can still be the hero; it just doesn't need to imply that some complexions are the villain.

And if you absolutely must do a transformation narrative, try starting everyone in the same shower. We all sing off-key under those echoey acoustics, after all. Now that's inclusivity you can take to the bank - or at least to the bathroom.

In the end, however, it comes back to the conclusion that was reached by another black colleague, AJ Wynter, writing about the controversy caused by a Heinz ad last October. The Heinz ad caused offence by showing the wedding of a mixed race couple but where the black bride's father was apparently absent. AJ asked, ""Will brands take this as an opportunity to embrace diversity authentically, or will they tread the line of performative representation? More crucially, will the voices that need to be amplified - the voices from the communities being depicted - finally be heard?""

Sadly, the answer appears to be 'not yet'. And there is no soft soaping that particular irritation.

"" ""I would have suggested either re-cutting the ad to balance the depiction of symptoms across ethnicities or, better, leading with a neutrally lit mixed-cast montage so no single model is saddled with the ""problem"" visual. I also would have flagged the need to avoid hyper-real audio of scratching, which risks ridicule when attached to a marginalised group."" Angel Skyers, Trainee Solicitor, Lewis Silkin LLP ""

Separately, Vertex Minerals (VTX:AU) announced a significant update on August 24, 2025, regarding the Reward Gold Mine Production [2]. The company's Reward gold mine has a current mineral resource estimate of 419,000 tonnes at a high-grade of 16.7 grams per ton (g/t) gold for 225,000 oz contained gold. The mine is strategically positioned to capitalize on the substantial potential of this high-grade gold project, unlocking significant value for its stakeholders.

Vertex Minerals employs gravity separation technology, a widely recognized, environmentally friendly method for gold recovery. This technique harnesses the natural force of gravity to separate gold from waste rock, significantly reducing the need for harsh chemicals. The company's gravity processing plant is expected to yield several positive outcomes, including an accelerated production timeline, a significant increase in throughput capacity, enhanced operational efficiency, and sustainable mining practices.

The company is led by a highly experienced management and technical team with a successful track record, committed to upholding the company’s strategic objectives and delivering shareholder value. Vertex Minerals is focused on the historic, high-grade Hill End gold property, with the ultimate goal of becoming Australia’s high-grade, green gold producer.

However, the momentum of the stock price is shifting towards the upside, suggesting that it has the potential to continue increasing.

Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO) experienced a significant drop in stock price, triggering an RSI oversold signal and a KDJ golden cross on August 26, 2025, at 13:30. This technical indicator suggests that the stock has reached a support level and may be poised for a rebound. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, while the KDJ (Keltner Channels) are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

According to the most recent 13F filing with the SEC, Wellington Management Group LLP reduced its stake in Diageo by 0.5% during the first quarter, selling 6,014 shares [1]. This move, along with a semi-annual dividend increase to $2.5192 per share, reflects a shift in investor sentiment [1]. The stock received a mix of ratings, with Goldman Sachs upgrading it from ""sell"" to ""neutral"" while four analysts rated it as a Buy and three maintained a Hold rating, resulting in a consensus rating of ""Hold"" [1].

Several institutional investors have recently added to or reduced their stakes in Diageo. Venturi Wealth Management LLC boosted its holdings by 3.6% during the first quarter, while Aptus Capital Advisors LLC increased its holdings by 5.4% in the fourth quarter. Grove Bank & Trust and Malaga Cove Capital LLC also increased their positions, indicating a mixed sentiment among institutional investors [1].

The current stock price of Diageo is $114.3990, with a 50-day moving average of $104.78 and a 200-day moving average of $107.81. The stock has a market cap of $63.64 billion and a PE ratio of 16.70. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 1.64, and its quick ratio is 0.67 [1].

Despite the recent price drop, the KDJ golden cross and RSI oversold signal indicate that the stock may be undervalued and has the potential for price appreciation. However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. It is essential to consider both technical and fundamental factors when analyzing a stock.

The company's Q3 2025 guidance reveals stark contrasts across its operating segments.","Agilent Technologies is set to announce FQ3 2025 earnings on August 27th, with a consensus EPS estimate of $1.37 and revenue estimate of $1.67B. Over the past 2 years, Agilent has exceeded earnings expectations 100% of the time.

Agilent Technologies (A) is set to release its fiscal Q3 2025 earnings on August 27th, with a consensus EPS estimate of $1.37 and revenue estimate of $1.67 billion. Over the past two years, Agilent has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, a track record that investors are closely watching.

The company's Q3 2025 guidance reveals stark contrasts across its operating segments. The Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) is projected to deliver a staggering 75.2% year-over-year revenue increase to $720.15 million, driven by strong demand for consumables, automation, and services. Conversely, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG) is expected to contract by 19.3% to $631.29 million, reflecting softness in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and biopharma markets, as well as normalization post-pandemic [1].

Agilent's Ignite Transformation program has emerged as a critical driver of resilience. The initiative, which focuses on supply chain diversification, pricing discipline, and organizational efficiency, is projected to deliver $130 million in FY25 profit. Early wins include $80 million in annualized savings from organizational agility improvements and $50 million from procurement centralization. These gains are expected to fully offset tariff-related costs by FY26, shielding margins from geopolitical risks [1].

Historically, Agilent's stock has experienced significant volatility. A 35.5% surge in 2021—driven by pandemic-era demand for diagnostics—was followed by declines of 5.5% in 2022, 6.4% in 2023, and 2.7% in 2024. As of July 2025, the stock trades at $120.35, 27.8% below its 52-week high of $153.84 but 19.9% above its 52-week low of $96.43. This range-bound behavior suggests a market that values Agilent's long-term potential but remains cautious about near-term risks [1].

Wall Street analysts have assigned Agilent a “Moderate Buy” rating, with a mean price target of $139.77 (16% above current levels). While eight analysts advocate a “Strong Buy” and eight recommend a “Hold,” the mixed sentiment reflects diverging views on the company's ability to sustain growth in a post-pandemic world [1].

Investors considering an entry into Agilent should weigh the company's strategic pivot toward high-growth areas like PFAS testing and advanced therapies, particularly as its Ignite savings begin to fully materialize in FY26. However, the LDG's underperformance and macroeconomic risks, such as U.S. funding uncertainties for academia and government labs, warrant caution [1].

For now, the stock's 16% upside potential and “Moderate Buy” consensus justify a watchful approach. Those who can stomach near-term volatility may find Agilent's mix of innovation and operational discipline a rewarding long-term bet [1].

Ecolab: Raymond James reinstates Market Perform, no rating change.

Ecolab Inc. (ECL), a leading global provider of water, hygiene, and energy technologies and services, has seen its stock price rise by 3.74% recently, but the market remains cautious due to mixed technical signals and divided analyst ratings. Raymond James has recently reinstated its Market Perform rating for Ecolab, indicating that the firm is waiting for a more compelling risk/reward opportunity before taking a constructive stance on the stock.

The company's stock has been trading near its 52-week high at $278.36, reflecting strong fundamentals and a market capitalization of $79 billion. Ecolab has maintained dividend payments for 55 consecutive years, further bolstering its appeal to investors seeking steady income. However, analysts are divided, with one ""Strong Buy,"" one ""Buy,"" and one ""Neutral"" rating in the last 20 days, indicating a mixed outlook on the company's prospects [1].

Technical indicators for Ecolab are mixed, with the technical analysis score of 4.07 suggesting a ""Weak technology, need to be cautious"" stance over the last five days. Recent indicators include a ""WR Overbought"" signal with a 62.2% win rate and an average return of 0.28%, and an ""RSI Overbought"" signal with a 20% win rate and an average return of -0.45%. These conflicting signals suggest market indecision and volatility, advising investors to wait for clearer trends before acting [2].

Fundamental factors for Ecolab are also mixed, with some strong cash flow metrics but weak growth indicators. The company's net cash flow from operating activities per share has declined by 14.74% year-over-year, and the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is highly elevated at 148.64. However, the equity multiplier is moderate, and the current ratio remains adequate, indicating liquidity is not a major concern [3].

Recent news has highlighted developments across various sectors that could indirectly benefit Ecolab. Safex Chemicals announced a new manufacturing facility in India to boost crop protection solutions, which could indirectly benefit Ecolab given its presence in industrial and institutional markets. In the U.S., changes to the COVID-19 vaccine policy have sparked uncertainty in healthcare sectors. Meanwhile, Genentech’s Itovebi made headlines with a successful trial in advanced breast cancer, potentially signaling growth in biotech-linked sectors. These events could impact Ecolab’s peers in related industries but may not directly affect Ecolab’s core operations [1].

In other recent news, Ecolab Inc. announced a definitive agreement to acquire Ovivo Electronics for approximately $1.8 billion in cash. This acquisition is aimed at bolstering Ecolab’s capabilities in water solutions for semiconductor manufacturing. Ovivo Electronics is projected to generate sales of $500 million in 2025, and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals. Jefferies has responded to this acquisition by raising its price target for Ecolab to $315 from $310, maintaining a Buy rating. Additionally, RBC Capital has reiterated its Outperform rating for Ecolab with a price target of $294 ahead of the company’s investor day [2].

Ecolab's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share, marking 88 consecutive years of dividend payments. This dividend will be payable on October 15, 2025, to shareholders recorded by September 16, 2025 [2].

Given the mixed signals and divided analyst ratings, investors should approach Ecolab with caution. While the company's fundamentals and recent acquisitions suggest growth potential, the high PE ratio and weak operating growth indicators are red flags for long-term value. Investors should closely monitor price movements and wait for clearer trends before taking a directional bet [3].

As one of the most successful developers of renewable energy in South Africa, Mainstream is well positioned as a partner of choice for private PPAs.","The Damlaagte PV Facility (“Damlaagte”) has established its commercial operation date, marking the start of a 20-year operational period for this 97.5 megawatt (MW) site. It formally started commercial operations on Saturday 23rd August 2025.

Located near Parys in the Free State province, Damlaagte connects to the Eskom grid and will provide approximately 270 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of clean electricity in its first year of operations. The Damlaagte PV Facility is owned by Mainstream Renewable Power (“Mainstream”), uBuzwe Energy (Pty) Ltd (“uBuzwe”) and the Thembelihle Trust. The site, constructed and operated by Mainstream Renewable Power, is the first renewable energy project to supply power under a landmark joint procurement program by its strategic partners, Air Liquide and Sasol.

The renewable energy from Damlaagte will be supplied to the Secunda site, where Air Liquide owns and operates the world’s largest oxygen production site, following its acquisition of the facility from Sasol in 2020. This PPA is the first to come online from a joint initiative between Air Liquide and Sasol to procure a total of nearly 700 MW of renewable power for these operations. This program is a key enabler for both companies’ ambitious decarbonization roadmaps.

“ Damlaagte PV Facility coming on line marks yet another great accomplishment for us in our journey towards lower carbon intensity ” said Simon Baloyi, Sasol’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This year, we have achieved several milestones in renewable energy, including securing an additional 160MW bringing the total renewable energy secured in South Africa, to more than 900MW. We are well on track to meet our 2030 Renewable Energy target of up to 2 GW.”

“The Damlaagte commercial operation is a major milestone for the decarbonization of our operations in Secunda, the world’s largest oxygen production site. It is a crucial step toward our goal of reducing CO₂ emissions from the Secunda operations by 30% to 40% by 2031, and a powerful demonstration of our global commitment to decarbonization,” said Nicolas Poirot, CEO, Africa, Middle East & India (AMEI) for Air Liquide.

Energy policy and supply is not only about technology, but also has a substantial influence on economicgrowth and socio-economic development. Construction of Damlaagte started in November 2023, employing almost 2000 people from nearby communities, including Tumahole, Schonkenville, and Vredefort. Damlaagte and its partners, Power China Maanda, LeadEPC, and Tractionel Holdings, utilised the services of local businesses where applicable and established a skills development programme that trained over 100 people.

“uBuzwe, a member of the Kholosani Group of Companies, is an infrastructure investment company, with a portfolio of 17 Renewable Energy assets that are part of our portfolio, uBuzwe has experience in the Solar, Solar Thermal and Wind power generation sectors and currently generates over a 1000 GWh per annum of clean energy.

Stocks Look Toward Nvidia and the Fed

The market is solid. It is within a whisker of the high. But this is the last week of August. What will it do when investors start really paying attention again after Labor Day?

There has been some back and forth recently. The indexes pulled back as technology and the AI trade ran out of gas. But then stocks rallied again after the Fed Chairman indicated at the Jackson Hole speech last week that the central bank would finally cut the fed funds rate in September. Wall Street loves rate cuts.

Normally, nothing happens in the market during the last week of August. Investors tend to focus on squeezing in the last bit of summer fun and put everything off until after Labor Day. But artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) will report earnings on Wednesday. The report is important because the AI rally fizzled earlier this month and there is growing speculation of a pullback ahead. Nvidia earnings may determine the near-term direction of tech stocks and, consequently, the market indexes.

But many other stock sectors will be more interested in the Fed. Wall Street is highly confident in a September rate cut. It is largely already priced into stocks. That means speculation about the timing of the next rate cut will move the market next month. The inflation and employment reports, as well as GDP, will be closely watched.

Tariffs are fading as a major market concern. The tech rally may continue or pause. The major focuses will be interest rates and the economy. Investors will be hoping for the Goldilocks scenario where the economy isn’t strong enough to deter the Fed or send longer-term rates higher but not weak enough to adversely affect earnings.

The next couple of weeks will likely determine whether the market rally fizzles or accelerates.

AGNC Investment Corporation (AGNC – yield 14.7%) – The mortgage REIT got some long-awaited good news last week when the Fed indicated it is likely to cut the fed funds rate at the September meeting. Lower short-term rates will lower costs for AGNC and raise profit margins. Lower rates will also have a positive effect on net asset value (NAV), which tends to dictate the stock price. Although AGNC has been trending higher since April, it is still well below the 52-week high. AGNC had several rough years during inflation and rising interest rates and is due for much better performance. The rate cuts may finally trigger a sustained rally in the price. HOLD

Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP – yield 6.1%) – The LNG export partnership reported earnings this month that beat on top line and missed slightly on earnings. Revenues jumped over 30% as new capacity came online, but earnings were a few cents below what was expected because of volume snafus and cost overruns. CPQ did reiterate guidance for the year. Parent company Cheniere Energy (LNG) reported an 85% surge in net income on stronger demand and higher cargoes. The two companies will be in sync eventually. Meanwhile, the new deal with the EU features Europe buying $750 billion worth of U.S. energy over three years, the bulk of which will be natural gas. Although CQP has been bouncy, there is mostly good news for the country’s largest LNG exporter, no matter how you slice it. (This security generates a K1 form at tax time.) BUY

Enterprise Product Partners (EPD – yield 6.9%) – The midstream energy partnership reported sluggish earnings as slower natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes somewhat offset record volumes in other areas. Enterprise reported an increase of 7% in distributable cash flow over last year’s quarter. NGL volumes were hurt by tariff and trade uncertainty. But things are about to get better. Enterprise has $6 billion in new projects coming online in the second half that are sure to boost growth. In addition, the trade deal with Europe should ensure high NGL volumes for years to come. EPD is a great buy while it’s still sleeping ahead of likely better days. (This security generates a K1 form at tax time.) BUY

Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN – yield 6.7%) – This more established and conservative BDC remains in the portfolio after FS KKR Capital Corp. (FSK) was sold two weeks ago. MAIN has more dimensions than FSK and can more successfully navigate market changes. The BDC reported strong earnings that beat expectations as net interest income rose 9% and net asset value per share increased 15%. Main also recorded the largest capital gain in its history upon the sale of equity stakes. The regular dividend was raised 2.9% and a supplemental dividend of $0.30 per share was declared, payable in September. But future performance will depend on the economy. HOLD

The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB – yield 3.5%) – After three strong years, WMB has mostly just bounced around this year. It has still returned about 7% YTD, so the performance may be uninspired, but it isn’t bad. Midstream energy companies had been hot for a long time, and this appears to be a consolidation period. But the environment is still highly positive and getting even better. The company expects a higher level of earnings growth in the second half because of rising volumes, pipeline expansions, and a recent acquisition. William also raised yearly guidance slightly. I consider the report a speed bump that makes the stock cheaper and worth acquiring at this price if you don’t own it already. BUY

AbbVie (ABBV – yield 3.2%) – Although there is tariff news on drugs still pending and holding back the stocks, ABBV has started moving higher anyway. It’s up over 11% in August and now within 4% of the all-time high. The recent positive news is successful trials in hair loss for the superstar drug Rinvoq. It’s more good news for the immunology drug, which, along with Skyrizi, has combined revenues that already exceeded peak Humira sales when it was the bestselling drug of all time. The company is moving well beyond the Humira patent loss, which had been holding ABBV back. The drug company reported earnings that beat expectations and raised revenue and earnings guidance for this year. ABBV has been moving higher since, as three analysts raised price targets. The tariff issues are still unresolved, but ABBV should be a big winner beyond that issue. HOLD

Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY – yield 3.0%) – After pulling back in July, the online banker stock is up over 10% in the last two weeks and not far from the highest price since last fall. ALLY is getting a boost from last week’s dovish Fed statements about interest rates. In the car loan business, lower rates make loans more affordable, and demand rises. Ally reported earnings earlier this month that soundly beat expectations. Auto-loan applications volume increased, and the company sees credit trends improving. Hopefully, the increasing momentum continues to push the stock price higher. The economy is nowhere near recession. Interest rates are still high but more likely to trend lower from here. HOLD

Broadcom Inc. (AVGO – yield 0.8%) – The AI juggernaut has pulled back from the high and is at the same level as a month ago. The torrid ascent has stopped, for now. That’s not a bad thing. No stock soars higher forever. AVGO is still up 112% from the April low and 30% YTD. There is also important news on the way that could potentially reignite the rally. Bellwether AI company Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings this Wednesday. The market views the results of the company as indicative of the current state of AI. Then, Broadcom reports earnings in the first week of September. The longer-term prognosis is strong because of soaring revenues. The next couple of weeks will likely determine the near-term direction of AVGO. HOLD

Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG – yield 0.8%) – The country’s largest exporter of natural gas reported stellar earnings with 43% revenue growth and an 85% net income increase over last year’s quarter on strong NGL demand and higher margins on its cargoes. Cheniere also reported progress on its expansion and the share buyback program. Meanwhile, the framework of the EU deal involves Europe buying $250 billion in U.S. energy per year, a dramatic increase from previous levels. Natural gas is the most in-demand energy source, and Cheniere is the largest U.S. exporter of natural gas. Trends highly favor strong performance of LNG going forward. BUY

Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG – yield 0.5%) – This nuclear, and soon natural gas, power provider stock has pulled back from the epic rise that peaked early this month. It’s down 12% from the early August high. But it was bound to run out of gas eventually. A consolidation is healthy and overdue. Meanwhile, earnings were solid. But the excitement surrounding the company and the stock is about future growth. The company announced huge deals with Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), and management indicated that more deals were likely on the way. Constellation is in the ideal position to benefit from a massive trend. HOLD

Eli Lilly and Company (LLY – yield 0.7%) – Shares of the drugmaker stock crashed 18% after the second-quarter earnings report revealed disappointing trial results for its oral weight-loss drug Orfoglipron. The market was excited about the hype of the oral drug and was disappointed. But it was likely an overreaction, and LLY has rebounded 14% from earlier this month.

Lilly’s earnings results were spectacular. The company smashed expectations with 38% revenue growth and 91% net income growth over last year’s quarter. Lilly also raised guidance for the year. Existing weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, are killing it with 68% and 172% year-over-year sales growth, respectively. An estimated 30% of Americans are overweight, and the market is massive. Mounjaro sold $5.2 billion in the quarter, putting it on track to be the best-selling drug of all time, and Zepbound, the newer drug, sold $3.4 billion. Even with the still-existing tariff uncertainty, LLY is at a bargain price that is likely to be significantly higher in a year. BUY

Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF – yield 3.3%) – The title insurance giant got a boost last week after the Fed statements. The lower interest rates will be conducive to better affordability, and FNF is up over 12% since early this month. Earnings were solid with 15.1% revenue growth and 22% earnings growth over last year’s quarter. The stock has a great track record and should be poised to thrive if the housing market takes off. In the meantime, performance will depend on the economy and the direction of interest rates. BUY

McKesson Corporation (MCK – yield 0.4%) – The supply chain pharmaceutical company posted earnings that beat expectations. Revenues grew 23.4% but earnings shrank year over year because of a divestiture and rising costs. MCK has pulled back this month and is down 8% from the 52-week high made in early July. The company can overcome the cost issues. It has in the past. Its market continues to grow all by itself because of the aging population. The health care sector is under pressure and will continue to be so in the weeks ahead as pricing and tariff issues are front and center. HOLD

Oracle Corporation (ORCL – yield 0.8%) – Like most of the technology sector, and AI stocks in particular, ORCL has pulled back a little this month. It’s down about 10% from the high. It’s an overdue consolidation after an epic run. Meanwhile, the cloud business is soaring and exceeding expectations and will likely continue to do so. Massive new business deals were announced that will take earnings and revenues to a whole new level in the years ahead. Oracle has morphed from a solid-growth large tech company into an AI darling that is in an ideal position to benefit from the biggest growth catalyst in a generation. The longer term is solid, and Nvidia’s earnings this week could determine the near-term direction of the price. HOLD

Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL – yield 0.7%) Earnings – The homebuilder company reported earnings last week that beat expectations. Toll Brothers reported record sales in the quarter with 8% revenue growth and 3.6% earnings per share growth over last year’s quarter. The environment is one of subdued homebuying because of high mortgage rates. But the future looks strong, and Toll Brothers has a massive backlog of houses to sell going forward.

The previously beleaguered luxury homebuilder stock has been trending higher since April and is getting a big boost lately. The longer-term supply/demand dynamic for housing is hugely favorable to Toll Brothers, as there aren’t nearly enough houses to satisfy the demand. The near-term impediment had been high mortgage rates. Rates have moved lower, as the Fed is likely to cut the short-term rates in September. HOLD

Waste Management, Inc. (WM – yield 1.4%) – WM has pulled back a little amid the market rally following the Fed’s indication that it will lower interest rates in September. It’s not a negative development for the company, but cyclical stocks rallied on the news and WM got neglected. The garbage king reported stellar earnings. The company soundly beat estimates with 19% revenue growth and projected 11.7% earnings growth over the next year. WM tends to be bouncy, although in an upward trend. It can also get neglected when aggressive stocks are rising. The defensive earnings will make WM attractive in a flat or down market, yet it has a history of solid performance in good markets, too. BUY

Safe Income Tier

American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP – yield 3.3%) – This has been a solid utility that has come as advertised. It outperformed in a crummy market and underperformed in good ones. But there is a strong chance that the skyrocketing growth in electricity demand will transform performance into something much better than it has been. Of course, the end of summer malaise, combined with the fact that AEP is a utility, has resulted in zero price movement since it was added to the portfolio two weeks ago. That’s okay. It is well positioned for growth ahead as well as a possible market selloff after Labor Day. BUY

NextEra Energy (NEE – yield 3.0%) – The nation’s largest electric utility reported strong earnings with 9% year-over-year earnings growth, which is very strong for a utility. The company also expects 8% earnings growth through at least 2027 and annual 10% dividend hikes. NEE is near the high end of the recent range but it has pulled back every time it has been around this level over the past year. But the future should be bright as this strong utility also benefits from growing electricity demand. NEE is knocking on the door of recent highs again and hopefully it can break out this time. BUY

USB Depository Shares (USB-PS – yield 5.7%) – Interest rates have remained peskily high this year. But fixed income got a boost over the last week after the Fed indicated a rate cut is coming in September. The recent Fed statement indicates that the trend for interest rates is more likely to be lower than higher in the months ahead. The high yield is safe, and the price could rally over the rest of the year. BUY

Vanguard Long-Term Corp. Bd. Index Fund (VCLT – yield 5.3%) – Ditto for VCLT. The long-term corporate bond ETF loves falling interest rates and hates rising ones. There will be more price pressure if rates continue to rise and vice versa. But the situation over the course of the year should be more positive than it has been.

Interglobe Aviation (Indigo) Placement – Second US$800m+ Deal by Co-Founder This Year

By Akshat Shah

InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (INDIGO IN) co-founder, Rakesh Gangwal, aims to raise around US$802m via selling around a 3% stake in Indigo.

He had earlier stated his intention to pare down his stake after a long drawn, and very public battle, with his co-founder Rahul Bhatia. He has sold many times before.

Parsons Corporation: Will The Acquisition of CTI for Expansion of Defense Capabilities Be A Game Changer?

By Baptista Research

Parsons Corporation’s second quarter 2025 results reflect a mixed but promising outlook for the company.

During this period, the company delivered revenue and adjusted EBITDA that aligned with expectations and guidance assumptions.

A notable highlight was the impressive cash flow, which exceeded forecasts.

Rocket Lab USA: Neutron Rocket Development to Amplify Revenue Opportunities & Market Competitiveness!

By Baptista Research

Rocket Lab Corporation’s recent quarterly financial disclosures portray a period of positive revenue growth, coming in at $144.5 million, a 36% increase compared to the same period last year.

This figure is notably above the high end of Rocket Lab’s prior guidance, signifying robust demand and operational execution, with growth driven by both the Space Systems and Launch Services segments.

Baptista Research looks to evaluate the different factors that could influence the company’s price in the near future and attempts to carry out an independent valuation of the company using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology.

En pasarela, se presentaron los nuevos productos Lumi y Paradise Big Deal, dos lanzamientos que reflejan las tendencias internacionales más buscadas: piel luminosa y pestañas con volumen extremo.

Un desfile parisino en clave argentina

El reconocido diseñador Fabián Zitta fue el encargado de vestir a las modelos con piezas de alta costura, mientras que Estefanía Novillo, maquilladora oficial de la marca, potenció cada look con los nuevos iluminadores y máscara de pestañas. La gran sorpresa de la noche fue el regreso de Valeria Mazza a la pasarela, acompañada por Mariana Genesio Peña, Anabel Sánchez, Candela Ruggeri y Michelle Masson, Agustina Casanova, entre otras. ¿Los conductores? Fueron Iván De Pineda y Teté Coustarot.

Los lanzamientos estrella

La protagonista indiscutida fue la línea Lumi, que incluye rubores e iluminadores diseñados para usarse solos o combinados. La última incorporación a esta línea fue Lumi Le Stick, los primeros iluminadores en barra de la marca, que ofrecen dos acabados distintos: Le Glass (efecto mojado y reflectivo) y Le Glow (intenso y satinado).

La otra gran novedad fue la máscara de pestañas Paradise Big Deal, con un cepillo cónico de cerdas cruzadas que aporta 20 veces más volumen, y gracias a su efecto construible alarga y separa las pestañas dejando una sensación ligera, sin grumos.

Invitados de lujo

La gala reunió a personalidades de la moda y el espectáculo como Pampita, Zaira Nara y Juana Tinelli, quienes disfrutaron de una experiencia única entre música, belleza y alta costura. Claudia Morinigo, Líder de Marketing de la categoría maquillaje de la marca en Argentina, destacó: “Buscamos generar un concepto donde el maquillaje y la moda se fusionen, dos elementos que forman parte del ADN de L’Oréal Paris.

ID26,L’Oréal,2025-08-27 01:32:35+00:00,www.thetimes.com,AstraZeneca among firms accused of 'funding Putin's war chest' - The Times,"Alex Ralph, James Hurley, Guy Taylor",,,,,https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/economics/article/astrazeneca-russia-ukraine-war-jbj2j09n5,"The Times reported in May that sales and taxes at the Russian business of AstraZeneca rose sharply last year, according to accounts filed at the Moscow tax office.
AstraZeneca’s Russia boss is also a member of Business Russia, a leading Russian business organisation whose congress in May was attended by President Putin.
However, Sir Rocco said selling the Russian hotels “would be very counterproductive”.
Inditex said it ceased Russian operations in March 2022 and exited the market entirely in April 2023.
It said details of the sale were sent to Spanish regulators in October 2022 and that terminating Russian operations cost it about €231 million.","The FTSE 100 pharmaceutical group paid $43 million, making it the 18th highest of the international companies that remain in Russia. It was the only British-based company in the top 20. Other multinationals in the top 20 included Pepsico and L’Oréal.

The report, “Corporate complicity: How global firms bankrolled Russia’s war chest in 2024”, alleged that international firms still operating in Russia had seemingly “chosen profit over principle” and continued “to pay corporate taxes and provide goods, services, and technology” that helped sustain “its war effort”.

Just over half (55 per cent, or 2,326) of the international companies with ties to Russia at the start of 2022, shortly before Russia invaded in February that year, have continued to do business there, the report found.

The remainder have announced they are “completely shutting down” or that they are temporarily reducing operations, it said.

The report said the tax contribution from international companies “is equivalent to nearly half of Russia’s projected military budget for 2025”, showing how foreign companies had continued to bankroll the “Russian war economy”.

The total revenue of foreign businesses in Russia was $201 billion last year, slightly higher than in 2023. Net profit in 2024 was $19.5 billion, the highest level in the past three years.

The report also found that increasing numbers of foreign companies have stopped publishing their financial reports, particularly large corporations, which it said “may reflect an effort by companies to avoid further reputational damage linked to” their Russian operations. Researchers therefore estimated some company figures based on data from previous years “to ensure comparability”.

• Russia faces yet more sanctions. But do they actually work?

Businesses from countries “aligned with the Kremlin”, particularly China and Turkey, continue to grow in the Russian market, the report found.

So-called “unfriendly” countries accounted for 82 per cent of total foreign business revenue last year, down from 95 per cent in 2021.

However, the share of American companies has remained “relatively stable” and the US and Germany, two of Ukraine’s largest bilateral donors, are the biggest corporate contributors to Russia’s economy.

The finance and payments sector was the top profit tax contributor and the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector remained the top revenue generator.

The growth in AstraZeneca’s operations in Russia has come under increased scrutiny this year, given the support from the British government for Ukraine.

The Times reported in May that sales and taxes at the Russian business of AstraZeneca rose sharply last year, according to accounts filed at the Moscow tax office.

Research by The Times has also revealed that AstraZeneca was the main sponsor of a large business event in April where the company’s Russia chief executive spoke alongside senior Kremlin figures, including a politician who is under British sanctions.

AstraZeneca’s Russia boss is also a member of Business Russia, a leading Russian business organisation whose congress in May was attended by President Putin. Its chairman has referred to Ukrainians as neo-Nazis.

• Business live: the latest on companies, markets and economics

Sir Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, vowed in February to continue making payments to Russian doctors and healthcare organisations after analysis by The Times of data issued in Russian showed that the business had spent about £45 million since the war against Ukraine began.

Soriot, 66, said in February that AstraZeneca had a big portfolio in Russia and its “mission is to bring new medicines to patients all over the world”, while “we try to stay away from politics”.

He added that medicines are excluded from sanctions “because they have a responsibility to bring those products to patients”.

A spokesman for AstraZeneca said: “Seven million patients in Russia rely on access to our essential and life-saving medicines … We make these available in line with all regulatory requirements.”

Sir Rocco Forte, the veteran hotelier, also decided to stay, keeping his hospitality group’s two hotels in St Petersburg operating following the 2022 invasion.

Rocco Forte Hotels has an investment in two hotels in the Russian port city and the latest filings show that they produced a pre-tax profit of £900,000 for the London-based group in the last financial year, bringing total profits from its Russian hotels since the war began in 2022 to £2.2 million, research by The Times found.

The luxury hotels owner and operator, which has sites across Europe, calls the 113-year-old Hotel Astoria in St Petersburg an “illustrious landmark” that “sits directly across from St Isaac’s Cathedral”. The group also includes The Angleterre, adjoined to the Astoria.

B4Ukraine, a coalition of nearly 100 civil society organisations that advocates the withdrawal of western firms from Russia, accused Rocco Forte Hotels of a “shameful example of greed triumphing over morality”.

However, Sir Rocco said selling the Russian hotels “would be very counterproductive”. Current rules in the country require a sale at 40 per cent of market value and payment of a 35 per cent “exit levy”, he said. The Russian government or a Russian citizen would be a possible buyer at a “knockdown price”.

Sir Rocco added that the hotel’s business was now entirely from Russian customers so the hotels were not bringing outside investment into the country’s economy. Profits in the subsidiary are effectively ringfenced, he added, due to Russian restrictions on how much money can be extracted from the country.

“We have fully complied with all the sanction rules,” he said, including holding the Russian hotels indirectly via a 60 per cent shareholding in a Russian company.

Inditex, the Spanish owner of fashion brands including Zara, is also facing scrutiny.

The Times has learnt that B4Ukraine wrote to Óscar García Maceiras, Inditex’s chief executive, last month, accusing the owner of Zara of a “fig leaf” departure from Russia.

A Financial Times investigation earlier this year revealed Inditex had injected €65 million into its Russian business and written off €120 million in loans, just before it was sold to the Lebanese Daher family for an undisclosed sum in 2023.

Nataliia Rybalko, a researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics, said at the time she “could think of no other examples of a western company putting money into the Russian business it was selling”.

It has been alleged that senior Inditex employees transferred to the Daher Group ahead of the sale, to help set up four replacement brands selling near-identical products in Russia to Inditex’s own marques.

B4Ukraine questioned whether the departure was “a genuine divestment” or “a transactional restructuring designed to” lay the groundwork for re-entry.

Inditex said it ceased Russian operations in March 2022 and exited the market entirely in April 2023. It said it does not “participate in any way in Daher’s business in Russia nor provides any kind of support to their commercial activities” there. It said details of the sale were sent to Spanish regulators in October 2022 and that terminating Russian operations cost it about €231 million. It said 4,000 people were transferred to the buyer and preservation of jobs was a “priority” of the deal.

Inditex said it had not “done anything improper in relation to its exit from the Russian market”.

A spokesman for L’Oréal said: “Right from the beginning, L’Oréal publicly condemned the invasion. We have gone above and beyond the required EU and US sanctions.

“We’ve closed our own stores in Russia, our directly operated counters in department stores and our own brand ecommerce sites. We’ve also suspended all industrial and state-owned media investments and stopped selling 80 per cent of our brand portfolio, including all brands from our luxury division.

“Our aim has been to keep our operations at a level that would allow us to continue to protect and support our Russian employees and our assets.”

Pepsico was approached for comment.

A UK government spokeswoman said: “Sanctions have deprived Russia of over $450 billion, equivalent to four more years of funding for Russia’s invasion. We have also implemented a wide range of prohibitions on investments in relation to Russia.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fa1adc49f-5b62-482c-bf19-62d25a9e260e.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-27 17:09:55.458904

Marque, who launched his new position in April, could not be reached for comment at press time.
He is reportedly an integral part of the new management team brought in by CEO Stefano Cantino.
Before joining Gucci, Marque held top roles at DFS Group, an LVMH subsidiary, leading global merchandising and marketing.

Christophe Marque’s purchase comes as the Big Apple gears up for New York Fashion Week in mid-September, although Gucci — which was part of February’s New York fashion week — does not appear to be a participant for the spring/summer 2026 shows. Instead, the Italian luxury brand is focused on a reboot, according to reports.

Marque, who launched his new position in April, could not be reached for comment at press time. He is reportedly an integral part of the new management team brought in by CEO Stefano Cantino.

Before joining Gucci, Marque held top roles at DFS Group, an LVMH subsidiary, leading global merchandising and marketing. He started his career at L’Oréal Luxe, working with tony brands like Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent, and Giorgio Armani, before making his name at Hermès.

The listing hit the market in May.

The ritzy residence is at 420 E. 75th St. — a boutique, seven-story building with just six units that was completed earlier this year.

The turnkey three-bedroom, 3.5-bath unit is 2,350 square feet, takes up a full floor and boasts two private balconies.

A private elevator landing opens to a large center hall. The smashing spread also features a formal library — plus an open great room for entertaining that boasts a wall of oversized windows with tree-top views of East 75th Street, and access to the home’s north-facing balcony.

The unit is also anchored by a roomy chef’s kitchen with a 10-foot island, a trash chute and a hidden walk-in pantry.

The primary bedroom suite features a walk-in closet, a spa-like bath with radiant heat and a south-facing balcony.

Building amenities feature a landscaped roof deck with elevator access and a barbecue. There’s also a residents’ library and a double-height lounge — as well as a private garden, a gym, a pet spa and a bike room.

The listing brokers were Tom Postilio and Mickey Conlon of Compass. Marque was repped by Brown Harris Stevens’ Matt Cohen.

On Thursday, Ross CEO James Conroy told investors that the chain’s top-performing category for its last quarter was beauty.
But unlike TJX, Ross does not offer online sales.
In February, Conroy took over the CEO role for Ross Stores from Barbara Rentler who led the company for nine years.
Beauty brand Frilliance By Fiona Frills climbs 38,000% on TikTok and plots app launch.","Beauty sales in the off-price category have held strong amid economic pressures. Last week, TJX, parent company to TJ Maxx and Marshall’s, reported 4% comparable sales growth and plans to open an additional 1,800 stores. While the company doesn’t share category sales breakdowns, CEO Ernie Herrman told investors that “customer transactions increased at every division,” and the company raised its annual guidance after its fiscal 2026 Q1 and Q2 exceeded expectations.

TJX has been expanding its beauty portfolio for years with offerings that often mirror that in Target, Sephora and Ulta Beauty, thanks to featured brands like Laneige, Clinique, Kate Somerville, Laura Mercier and Murad, among many others.

Now, Ross Dress for Less is also seeing growth in its beauty section. On Thursday, Ross CEO James Conroy told investors that the chain’s top-performing category for its last quarter was beauty. The off-price chain, which has more than 1,800 locations in the U.S., reported a 5% sales increase to reach $5.5 billion during its Q2 2025 earnings call on Thursday.

“We feel very good about the momentum coming out of the quarter,” said Conroy. During the call, he told investors that “cosmetics was the best merchandise area” for the quarter, with the top sales in beauty found in the Southeast and Midwest. “Kudos to that merchandising team that has gotten that business up,” said Conroy. He added that beauty sales were “better than the chain average” and called beauty a category “that’s gotten a lot of attention over the last few years.”

Similar to TJX, top beauty brands sell into Ross to boost cash liquidity, offload older products or liquidate products after packaging changes or reformulations. They also look to the retailer as a sampling marketing endeavor or to reach consumers trading down for cheaper products, among other reasons. But unlike TJX, Ross does not offer online sales.

Ross shoppers have shared their hauls on TikTok, Reddit and YouTube. Videos and posts reviewed by Glossy have included brands like Urban Decay, Josie Maran, Ole Henriksen, First Aid Beauty, Buxom, Hourglass, COSRX, Briogeo, Too Faced, Nars, Clinique and many more.

Ross launched in 1982 and currently operates 1,847 stores in 44 states, as well as 358 dd’s Discount stores in 22 states. The company opened 28 new stores in the first half of the year and plans to add 52 more this year, with a focus on locations in New York City and its first locations in Puerto Rico.

In February, Conroy took over the CEO role for Ross Stores from Barbara Rentler who led the company for nine years. His CV includes Boot Barn and Claire’s. His arrival could mean a shift in focus toward beauty.

According to Placer.ai, a location analytics firm that charts foot traffic, Ross foot traffic was up 5.8% during its Q2 and 7.1% in July. It beat competitors TJX and Burlington in repeat customer visits. According to the firm, the share of visitors frequenting Ross at least twice a month in Q2 2025 grew to 28.9%, up from 27.0% in Q1 2025 and 28.4% in Q2 2024.

“A divide has emerged between value-oriented and discretionary retail,” said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. “Q2 earnings reports highlighted this split … as consumers hunt for bargains.”

Executive moves:

Michael Fiddelke will take over the CEO role of Target effective February 1, 2026. Fiddelke is Target’s current COO and will replace Brian Cornell as CEO after an 11 year tenure. The change was fueled by two and a half years of flat or falling sales for the retailer and ongoing protests around the retailer’s DEI policy rollbacks.

Natasha Vaquer is the new co-head of brand partnerships of UTA Talent Agency’s UTA Creators division. Vaquer previously served as SVP of talent partnerships and influencer strategy at Refinery29.

News to know:

L’Oréal is investing $80 million into the expansion of its manufacturing facilities in Mexico. It’s part of the industry’s wider investment in near-shoring manufacturing into Mexico as brands work toward diversifying their supply chains away from Asia. The conglomerate plans to use the $80 million to expand its facilities in San Luis Potosí and Mexico City in 2026.

Australian sunscreen brand Ultra Violette is pulling its Lean Screen sunscreen from shelves after a June investigation by Choice, an Australian consumer advocacy publication, found that it provided less sun protection than advertised. The brand first denied the claims that its formula did not offer the SPF level printed on the package but acknowledged its mistake on Friday after completing its own tests. In a message to consumers, the brand said it would no longer be working with the contract manufacturer that made the formula or the testing company Ultra Violette employed. It will also be revamping its own internal testing protocols.

Louis Vuitton’s first cosmetics line, called La Beauté, is set to launch on Friday in Louis Vuitton stores and online. The line has already made headlines thanks to its sky-high price points: $250 for eyeshadow and $160 for lipstick, available in 55 shades, and lip balm, available in 10. Makeup artist Pat McGrath serves as the line’s creative director.

Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty has partnered with Mexican seasoning brand Tajin for a cheek and lip color set inspired by the iconic product’s red hue. The duo is available for $30 DTC and through Sephora.

In an era where body- and skin-care brands are launching hair care, Tracee Ellis Ross is going the opposite direction. The star’s hair-care brand, Pattern Beauty, entered the body-care category with Thursday’s launch of body wash, oil, cream and more. The line will sell DTC and through Ulta Beauty and Sephora in the coming weeks. Pattern Beauty was incubated by Beach House Group.

Stat of the week:

The U.S. prestige beauty market grew by 2% to reach $16 billion during the first half of the year, while sales at mass merchants increased 4% to reach $34.6 billion, according to a new report from market research company Circana. Standouts include prestige fragrance and hair-care sales, which each increased by 6%.

In the headlines:

With the rise of the chief AI officer, it’s time to examine ‘czar’ culture. Many Target stores will stop fulfilling online orders. Beauty brand Frilliance By Fiona Frills climbs 38,000% on TikTok and plots app launch. Rise in foodie perfumes may be linked to weight-loss drugs. Is petcare the next luxury opportunity?

Repatha is an effective therapy for reducing LDL-C, particularly in patients whose disease remains uncontrolled with statins or who cannot tolerate them.""
Repatha was first approved in 2015 and has been used by more than 5 million people worldwide.
By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.
Repatha is approved in more than 74 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union.","Aug. 25, 2025 — Amgen has announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has broadened the approved use of Repatha (evolocumab) to include adults at increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) due to uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), commonly known as ""bad cholesterol."" The update removes a prior requirement for a patient to have been diagnosed with cardiovascular (CV) disease.

""Far too many adults at risk of cardiovascular disease are not achieving their LDL-C goals, despite it being one of the most modifiable risk factors for a heart attack or stroke,"" said Murdo Gordon, executive vice president of Global Commercial Operations at Amgen. ""This label update highlights the real-world need for additional treatment options for at-risk patients. Repatha is an effective therapy for reducing LDL-C, particularly in patients whose disease remains uncontrolled with statins or who cannot tolerate them.""

In addition to expanding Repatha's label to include adults at increased risk of MACE, the FDA also:

expanded the use of Repatha alone (monotherapy) to include patients with a rare, genetic form of high cholesterol known as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH); and

emphasized that Repatha should be used alongside diet and exercise for managing high cholesterol.

Repatha was first approved in 2015 and has been used by more than 5 million people worldwide.

Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. The clinical benefits and safety of Repatha have been studied for 15 years in 50 clinical trials with over 57,000 patients.

Repatha is approved in more than 74 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.",http://www.dicardiology.com/sites/default/files/Amgen%20Repatha.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:03:45.170530

The bond repair giant has acquired the Boston-based biotech company for an undisclosed sum as part of “its commitment to product innovation”.

Purvala Bioscience was founded in 2020 by Dr Bradley Olsen and develops bio-inspired technologies with applications across the health and beauty industries.

Dr Olsen, who also serves as a Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT in the US, is focused on the creation of molecules inspired by naturally occurring biological structures.

“Since the very beginning, Olaplex was founded on the concept of innovation, with its original groundbreaking technology designed to empower stylists and their clients to achieve transformative results,” said Olaplex CEO Amanda Baldwin.

“Scientific breakthroughs are what continue to inspire us as we remain committed to delivering the best possible products for our stylist community and our consumers.

“What we have accomplished to date has already left such a meaningful impact on our industry.

“And we believe that with Purvala Bioscience we have the potential to create the next generation of disruptive science-backed product innovation alongside our patent-protected bond-building technology, Bis-amino.""

This is the first acquisition Olaplex has made since launching more than ten years ago.

The hair care brand is best known for its bond-building product formulations.

Beauty mergers and acquisitions have been hotting up this year.

L’Oréal has bought both hair care brand Color Wow and vitamin A skin care specialist Medik8 to strengthen its portfolio.

Unilever has snapped up male grooming brand Dr. Squatch and personal care brand Wild to further cement its position in the personal care space.

Plus, Hailey Bieber’s Rhode has been acquired by e.l.f. Beauty for US$1bn.

Co-founded by Valentina Jordan, who led product and engineering teams at logistics unicorn Rappi, and Rafael Santiago, who led one of the preeminent importing logistics companies in the Caribbean, Nauta addresses this opportunity by equipping importers who own, generate, and manage this data, with an AI-powered, single source of truth and control center. With its flexible, agentic capabilities, Nauta automates routine workflows, gives importers the control they need to grow margins, and drives agile, data-driven actions.

“Nauta is built by and for operators,” said Valentina Jordan, CEO and co-founder of Nauta. “We truly understand the variability in their day-to-day work and are focused on helping them control the controllable. In logistics, every container tells its own story, but the systems involved rarely speak the same language. With AI, Nauta helps companies make faster, more proactive decisions about every shipment, reducing risk, improving cash flow, and growing margins.”

Since its launch in Q1 2025, Nauta is now servicing importers in seven countries and works with leading distributors of globally recognized brands, including New Balance, Ashley Furniture HomeStore, L'Oréal, Modelo, Moët & Chandon and others. With Nauta’s platform, importers have reduced detention costs by up to 80 percent, increased operator productivity by 30 percent, and improved container processing times by 75 percent. In addition to the institutional funds, participation in this round includes angel investors Simón Borrero (CEO and co-founder, Rappi), Waikit Lau (Founder, RemoteHQ), and Juan Jose Gonzales (CEO, Windmar Energy) as well as a range of early Nauta customers and partners including Soriana, one of the largest retailers across the Americas.

“Supply chains don’t just move goods, they also move data and money,” said Camila Saruhashi, Partner at Construct Capital. “That complexity increases significantly with cross-border shipments, where every touchpoint adds layers of documentation, compliance, and coordination. With so many stakeholders and systems involved, Nauta’s AI platform is well-positioned to bring structure and visibility to this vital process, connecting the dots between every node, from manufacturers to ports to warehouses.”

Global Trade Requires AI-Native Solutions

In 2024, U.S. trade in goods surpassed $5.3 trillion, with imports from Asia and Latin America alone exceeding $2.3 trillion. Food distributors and CPG companies are especially vulnerable, navigating demand fluctuations, delivery delays, and cost volatility with tools ripe for evolution. According to McKinsey, over 70 percent of supply chain leaders say they’ve had to reconfigure their global footprint in the past 12 months, yet most teams are still stuck reacting to issues after they’ve already occurred.

“Importers don’t just need visibility, they need the power to act before problems occur,” said Rafael Santiago, COO and co-founder of Nauta. “We built Nauta because we lived through the pain of fragmented information and manual workflows prone to costly mistakes. Operators deserve modern AI tools that anticipate issues and enable action at the speed of trade.”

The new capital will accelerate Nauta’s global expansion. The company is actively recruiting sales and partnerships talent; interested candidates can visit www.getnauta.com.",http://hfbusiness.com/portals/0/logo_HFB_fb1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:10:30.826472

The Naira came under foreign exchange (FX) pressure on Tuesday, August 26, as its value further weakened against the US Dollar in the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (NAFEM) at the close of transactions.

According to data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigerian currency lost N1.11 or 0.07 per cent against the greenback yesterday to sell for N1,537.61/$1, in contrast to the N1,536.51/$1 it was traded on Monday.

However, the domestic currency appreciated against the Pound Sterling in the official market during the session by N1.47 to close at N2,074.24/£1 compared with the previous day’s N2,075.71/£1 and gained N4.45 against the Euro to close at N1,793.17/€1 versus Monday’s closing price of N1,797.62/€1.

In the parallel market, the Nigerian Naira depreciated against the Dollar yesterday by N2 to trade at N1,547/$1 compared with the preceding session’s rate of N1,545/$1.

There has been a rising demand for the US Dollar by eligible corporate FX users seeking foreign payments, pushing the central bank to inject FX into the system.

AIICO Capital Limited, in a note, said the interbank NFEM saw increased FX demand against a limited supply.

Meanwhile, Nigeria’s external reserves could rise to about $45 billion by the end of the year, according to market analysts. According to Cowry Assets Management, the momentum of reserve growth appears likely to continue, supported by steady offshore inflows and potential external borrowings planned by the government.

But, this is hinged on global risk conditions remaining broadly supportive and offshore flows not significantly disrupted. With the reserves position strengthening, the CBN will have greater flexibility to sustain its interventionist approach in the FX market.

As for the cryptocurrency market, it grew during the session as traders jumped back in after Monday’s sell-off. Traders seized lower prices as an opportunity to re-enter the market.

Analysts warn of overheated sentiment ahead of Friday’s PCE inflation data, a key signal for the US Federal Reserve next move.

Also, investors and traders remain widely optimistic due to expectations of monetary easing and increased institutional demand, with Solana (SOL) expanding by 7.4 per cent to $203.06.

Dogecoin (DOGE) appreciated by 4.5 per cent to $0.2205, Ethereum (ETH) rose by 3.7 per cent to $4,594.36, Cardano (ADA) increased by 2.9 per cent to $0.8642, Ripple (XRP) grew by 2.8 per cent to $3.00, Litecoin (LTC) jumped by 2.2 per cent to $113.48, Binance Coin (BNB) soared by 1.6 per cent to $859.24, and Bitcoin (BTC) advanced by 0.9 per cent to $111,273.21, while the US Dollar Tether (USDT) and the US Dollar Coin (USDC) closed flat at $1.00 each.",https://businesspost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alternative-Bourse-NASD-Securities.png,N,,2025-08-27 16:58:58.594174

Dive Brief:

Colgate-Palmolive plans to optimize its global supply chain as part of a three-year, $200 million to $300 million productivity program, CFO Stanley Sutula told investors on an Aug. 1 earnings call.

The initiative will also include restructuring parts of the personal and home care company's organizational framework and streamlining operations to reduce overhead and increase efficiency, per the company's Q2 earnings statement.

""We're not going to go into detailed specifics here, but as we said, it would be a combination of optimizing our supply chain and then looking at areas where we think that we can optimize where we have our allocation of resources,"" Sutula said.

Dive Insight:

Colgate-Palmolive, like many manufacturers, is leveraging its supply chain as a source for higher productivity, lower costs and operational efficiency. In June, Procter & Gamble unveiled plans to reorganize its network as part of a two-year restructuring project.

Colgate-Palmolive's latest productivity program comes less than 12 months after it completed a two-year initiative that included streamlining the company's supply chain to reduce structural costs, per the company's latest annual report.

However, the company’s subsequently leaner supply chain faces different macroeconomic conditions than when Colgate-Palmolive completed the effort at the end of 2024.

""Colgate-Palmolive is dealing with volatile and rising costs due to tariff increases, higher raw and packaging material costs and lower category inflation, which leaves less room to raise retail prices in response to rising costs in other parts of the business,"" CEO Noel Wallace said on the earnings call.

Colgate-Palmolive's supply chain has also had to respond quickly to demand changes fueled by consumer uncertainty, Wallace said. That includes adjusting to consumer preferences when they shift between more expensive product multipacks and less expensive single packs or smaller sizes.

""We can then leverage our global supply chain's breadth, resiliency and agility to respond to these changes in consumer preference,"" Wallace said.

In releasing its Q2 earnings, Colgate-Palmolive lowered its projected 2025 tariff costs to $75 million from the $200 million stated in its Q1 earnings call. The latest estimate is based on tariffs announced and finalized as of July 31, per an earnings presentation.

Headline Takeaway: Ecolab (ECL) is showing a mixed market picture — fundamentals remain strong, but recent technical signals suggest caution.

The stock currently trades at a 0.63% increase, with a 4.96 internal diagnostic score (0-10) on fundamentals and a 7.7 internal diagnostic score on fund flows, but a 4.17 internal diagnostic score from recent technical indicators signaling a need for caution.

2. News Highlights

Recent news surrounding Ecolab and the broader market includes:

Safex Chemicals Expands Manufacturing Footprint – A major development in crop protection solutions could indirectly benefit Ecolab’s industry. The new facility will add approximately 300 jobs and scale to 80 MT/day production.

U.S. Energy & Chemicals Industry Growth – Deloitte predicts a 4.1% workforce growth by 2033 and highlights the need for upskilling in AI and related technologies — a positive backdrop for Ecolab's long-term business.

U.S. Regulatory Shifts Affecting Exports – New restrictions on chemical shipments to China could disrupt global supply chains and indirectly affect Ecolab’s market dynamics.

These developments highlight a cautiously optimistic industry environment but also potential near-term headwinds.

3. Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab has received a mixed but generally optimistic set of ratings from analysts:

Simple Average Rating: 4.00 (out of 5)

Historical Performance-Weighted Rating: 5.47

Rating Consistency: Mixed, with one ""Strong Buy,"" one ""Buy,"" and one ""Neutral"" rating in the past 20 days.

Price Trend Match: Current price is up 0.63%, aligning with a weighted optimistic market expectation.

Key fundamental factor values (with internal diagnostic scores) include:

Net cash flow from operating activities per share (YoY growth rate %): -14.74% — score: 1 (weak)

PE: 148.64 — score: 4 (cautious)

Net cash flow from operating activities (YoY growth rate %): -15.02% — score: 2 (very weak)

Total profit / EBIT (%): 90.59% — score: 2 (cautious)

Cash-UP: 0.65 — score: 3 (moderate)

CFOA: 2.96% — score: 3 (moderate)

Cost of sales ratio (%): 55.48% — score: 1 (weak)

Equity multiplier (DuPont analysis %): 255.14% — score: 3 (moderate)

Current ratio: 144.15% — score: 2 (cautious)

Cash-MV: -53.95% — score: 1 (very weak)

While some fundamentals remain strong, the recent operating cash flow and net profit margins are weak indicators. Investors should monitor upcoming earnings and balance sheet changes.

4. Money-Flow Trends

Big-money flows show a positive overall trend, with large and extra-large institutional flows at 50.79% and 50.15% inflow ratios respectively, indicating confidence from major investors. In contrast, retail flows are negative, with small investors showing a net outflow at 49.79%.

This contrast between institutional and retail sentiment suggests a divergence in market psychology. Big money remains optimistic, but individual investors appear cautious or bearish in the short term.

5. Key Technical Signals

Technical indicators present a mixed and uncertain market. The internal diagnostic score is 4.17 (0-10), with weak technology and a need for caution as the main takeaway. Here's a breakdown of the recent signals:

RSI Overbought: internal diagnostic score: 1 — bearish bias, with a 20% historical win rate.

Marubozu White: internal diagnostic score: 1 — bearish bias, with a 12.5% win rate.

Bearish Engulfing: internal diagnostic score: 7.82 — bullish bias, with a high 71.43% win rate.

WR Overbought: internal diagnostic score: 6.85 — neutral bias.

Recent Chart Patterns by Date:

2025-08-22: WR Overbought

2025-08-21: WR Overbought

2025-08-19: WR Overbought and Marubozu White

2025-08-18: WR Overbought and Bearish Engulfing

2025-08-20: WR Overbought and RSI Overbought

These patterns suggest a highly volatile market with conflicting signals — bearish and bullish — over the past five days. The lack of a clear trend reinforces the need for caution.

6. Conclusion

Ecolab presents a mixed investment outlook. Fundamentally strong, with a solid institutional flow, it is currently facing conflicting technical signals and weak cash flow growth. Investors should consider waiting for a clearer trend to form before entering new positions.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:06:15.089340

The firm finds the current valuation difficult to justify and notes that forward pricing and margin expectations set a high bar for the stock.

Ecolab (ECL) shares have seen a mixed performance recently, with a 3.74% rise but facing uncertain technical signals and mixed analyst ratings. The stock's technical analysis score of 4.07 indicates a need for caution, with indicators like the RSI being overbought and bearish engulfing signals present [1].

Analysts have shown divided ratings, with one ""Strong Buy,"" one ""Buy,"" and one ""Neutral"" rating in the last 20 days. The average rating score is 4.00, while the performance-weighted score is 5.47. Despite the optimistic ratings, fundamentals reveal weak operating growth and a high 148.64 P/E ratio, with net cash flow from operating activities declining by 14.74% year-over-year [1].

Strong institutional and retail inflows, with an inflow ratio of 0.51, suggest market optimism. However, the overall technical picture is volatile, with conflicting signals and no clear direction. The recent expansion of Safex Chemicals in India and growth in Asia-Pacific ETFs could indirectly benefit Ecolab, but broader market risks, such as U.S.-China export restrictions, pose concerns [2].

Ecolab's current market position is precarious, with mixed fundamentals and technical indicators. The best course of action for investors may be to wait for a clearer trend before committing to a directional bet. A pull-back or breakout in the near term could provide a better entry point.

Trump wants her gone by Sept. 8 - NPR,Andrea Hsu,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5502439/trump-immigration-tps-health-care,"LOS ANGELES — Aurora was working as a nurse at a hospital in her home country of Honduras when she decided to leave for good.

The union does not track the immigration status of its members, but the long-term care sector relies heavily on immigrants.
The sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer remain fresh on everyone's mind.","LOS ANGELES — Aurora was working as a nurse at a hospital in her home country of Honduras when she decided to leave for good. A mother of two, she yearned for a better future for herself and her young daughters. So in 1990, she went in search of that, making the journey through Mexico into the United States.

She eventually found work in Los Angeles, taking care of older adults in their homes. She bathes, feeds and changes them and sometimes takes them places, like the beauty salon. She often stays with the same clients for years, through good health and bad and, in some cases, until death.

For a while, she did this work without legal status. But then, in late 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. granted temporary protected status (TPS) to Hondurans, citing the environmental disaster the hurricane had wrought.

For the first time, Aurora had government permission to live and work in the United States.

""I felt protected,"" she says in Spanish. NPR agreed not to use Aurora's last name because she now fears being targeted by immigration authorities.

TPS for Hondurans was renewed multiple times over the years. But this year, the Trump administration decided to terminate it, effective Sept. 8.

""Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement in July. ""It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago. Honduran citizens can safely return home.""

The decision is being challenged in court. But on Wednesday, a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling, paving the way for the Trump administration to terminate TPS for Hondurans while litigation continues.

With Sept. 8 quickly approaching, Aurora faces a future of uncertainty.

""We don't know what will happen,"" she says. ""We don't know anything.""

An end to immigration programs designed to provide temporary refuge

Since returning to office, President Trump has ended a number of programs granting immigrants refuge from unsafe conditions back home, citing national security concerns.

""For decades, TPS has been abused as a de facto amnesty program to allow unvetted aliens to remain in the U.S. indefinitely,"" Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Too often, these programs have been exploited to allow criminal aliens to come to our country and terrorize American citizens.""

McLaughlin's statement included photos of Hondurans with TPS who've been convicted of crimes in the U.S., including aggravated assault and a sex offense against a child.

Aurora, who has spent most of her adult life in Los Angeles, wants to convey a different message about the roughly 72,000 Hondurans granted TPS over the years, as well as those from other countries.

""Not all immigrants are criminals,"" she says. ""We are hardworking people earning an honest living.""

Few opportunities to gain permanent status

Like so many other noncitizens in the U.S., Aurora wishes she could become a permanent resident or even a citizen. Her union, Service Employees International Union Local 2015, representing roughly half a million long-term care workers in California, has been pushing lawmakers to create a path to citizenship for people like her.

""They give so much. I think they're deserving of us being able to find a system that works for them,"" says SEIU Local 2015 President Arnulfo De La Cruz.

De La Cruz notes that caregivers represented by the union serve California's lowest-income older adults and people with disabilities — those who qualify for government-funded care.

The union does not track the immigration status of its members, but the long-term care sector relies heavily on immigrants. In a 2023 report, the California Health Care Foundation estimated that close to half of California's direct care workforce — those caring for older adults or disabled people in their homes or in facilities — are immigrants. With a rapidly aging population, California could face a shortage of between 600,000 and 3.2 million care workers by 2030, the report says.

Before the termination of TPS for many immigrants, ""we were already in a huge care shortage,"" says De La Cruz. ""There's not enough caregivers to be matched with people who need care.""

De La Cruz has heard the argument that immigrants should get in line and wait their turn. He says that it's not that simple.

""It's not an application that you fill out and you get processed,"" he says, adding that the few pathways that do exist, including through marriage to a U.S. citizen or political asylum, are difficult given the requirements.

De La Cruz is struck recalling that just a few years ago, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, care workers were recognized as essential, even heralded as heroes. The country could not do without them. And now, for at least some of them, the message is: Go home. ""To go from that to this … I think, is creating an enormous amount of stress,"" he says.

Elevated anxiety for the care workforce

Roberto Oronia is feeling that stress, even though he is a U.S. citizen, born in Los Angeles.

""This has infected everybody,"" he says. ""I say infected. It's not affected. It has infected the psyche.""

Oronia works as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home in the San Fernando Valley, alongside a lot of immigrants who, like him, have family members, friends and co-workers who fear getting caught up in Trump's immigration enforcement.

The sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer remain fresh on everyone's mind. Reports that officers have been detaining people based on their appearance and that legal U.S. residents have been among those arrested have stoked fear that no person of color is safe, Oronia says.

""What's it matter whether I'm born here?"" he says. ""It's just a matter of your skin color and your last name.""

Oronia worries that the anxiety he and other care workers are experiencing could have consequences for the people under their watch.

""When anxiety's elevated, people are nervous, people are stressed, their minds are on other things,"" he says. ""Accidents happen.""

Aurora does not want to return to Honduras. Although nearly three decades have passed since Hurricane Mitch, she says her home country is still dangerous, wracked by tremendous poverty, gangs and corruption.

I used to roast coffee. Nowadays, even just drip coffee is five bucks, and that is a little bit of sticker shock, but I’m going to say I will still keep drinking it until it gets to probably 10 bucks a cup. And then I’m going to have to really pause and take that in. But, as somebody who is actually fueled by coffee, I’m not sure what would become of me if I didn’t have it in my life.

I live in Chicago, one of the most incredible food cities in the country, and so I’m going to give a pat answer: around the corner. Wherever you are in the city, you can go around the corner and there’s some phenomenal cuisine that tastes great—local, family made, community driven restaurant. We live in such a wealth of amazing opportunities for culinary delights. But if you want me to actually give you an answer, [maybe something recent], I went to “Falafel Kebab Station” in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago. We got basically four meals worth of delicious falafel for $34, which was incredible.

My mother was an incredible guiding person to me, because she was a very empathetic, kind, and compassionate person who was also very hard working and service driven—a friend to everybody, really cared about her community—and that’s something that she instilled deeply in me.

But I also really admired people from history. Going to visit places that were about people’s stories was something really important to me. One of the first sites that I went to as a kid—I grew up in Minnesota—was Fort Snelling. It’s one of our historic sites, and it was part of the Dred Scott case. So, I learned about Dred Scott and the fight for his rights. So, I continue to look to people who had incredible strength in times of difficulty, and how they were able to overcome fear, to tap into their courage to do things that were difficult.

I’m going to give you one that needs a tremendous amount of our love, our care, our respect: Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, near the South Side of Chicago. It’s where Emmett Till’s open casket wake took place in 1955, so the importance of that particular place changed the course of history. Being in that place enables us to talk about the Great Migration, the violence that continued to plague people who were living in Jim Crow America, and that returning to where his family was from ended up in murder for Emmett Till and this horrible pain for his mother. The decision that she made to make that very public, and show her pain—Jet magazine, which was run by the Johnson family here in Chicago, published those photos from it—and that changed the course of civil rights in the United States, to see that kind of horror and violence, which is sometimes shielded to certain people in this country.

[The church] has just become a national monument. President Biden made the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, which includes sites in Mississippi as well as Chicago. [The church is] being restored right now, but needs a lot of financial, community, and moral support, and publicity and media.

The story that often comes to mind was when I was working in Minnesota. I was working in St. Paul on a very large historic site, but also very deteriorated: Schmidt Brewery on the west side of the city. We had been trying to find ways to reuse this place which had a lot of important connections to people’s stories: immigrant history, migrant history, labor, beer prohibition, all of these really interesting connections to stories today. In this case, based on how the rules were applied in my field, essentially, there was a denial of an opportunity to reuse this as affordable housing because of a really precious notion of saving the material over the opportunities that it had for changing people’s lives. And that was a pivotal moment in my career where I really took a new look at what we were doing and made the decision to try to marshal the courage to make change.

All around, some 250 children from diverse backgrounds are playing road hockey and meeting on-ice heroes who look like them, including the Los Angeles Kings’ Akil Thomas, free agent brothers Gemel and Givani Smith, and retired winger-turned-Golden Knights assistant coach Joel Ward. Instead of the usual rock music heard at hockey rinks, the sounds of Drake, Tyla and Burna Boy blare from a DJ’s speakers. Had it not been for Air Canada’s flight attendant strike, former NFL stars and HDA supporters Colin Kaepernick and Marshawn Lynch would’ve attended too.

“Hockey is a sport that we all love, but there’s just so many barriers that come into playing the game — financial, racial, all these other things,” HDA founder Akim Aliu said. “So we’re trying to remove those barriers and make it a welcoming space for everybody.”

The effort comes at a particularly challenging time. Five years after the HDA’s launch amid a historic wave of social justice protests, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives everywhere are under attack, from inside the U.S. government to the corporate world. Sports are no different. Major League Baseball has removed references to “diversity” on the careers page of its website. The NFL has paused its “Accelerator” program, which helped increase opportunities for diverse candidates in coaching and management positions.

The NHL, for its part, says it remains committed to DEI initiatives like its “Player Inclusion Coalition,” founded in June 2023 with P.K. Subban and Anson Carter as co-chairs. According to NHL chief communications officer Jon Weinstein, the coalition has educated over 1,000 professional players on “the benefits of inclusion”; awarded over $425,000 in grants to expand access and opportunity in the sport; and held a number of community events, including panels, hockey clinics and mentorship sessions.

“It’s a priority,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said last November. “We have a group of current and former players who are working to have their own programs in conjunction with us that we all finance. We have our ‘Declaration of Principles,’ which continues to stand for the values of the game. It remains a high priority. We want this game to be inclusive, to be welcoming, and grassroots programs that support that will remain a priority.”

Whereas the HDA once imagined itself working in tandem with the NHL to make hockey more inclusive, Aliu expressed doubt that an olive branch could ever be extended given the league’s “current leadership.” But, added Aliu, a former journeyman defenseman who played seven games for the Flames in the early 2010s, “Never say never. … If they show a willingness to do it in the right way, we’d be happy to take a look at it.”

Either way, the HDA must skate ahead with its mission. Even as more diverse groups are represented at the sport’s highest level, its high costs keep many out of the game. And if they’re playing, certain corners could still stand to be much more accommodating to players of color.

“We still hear stories about racism in the sport,” Duclair said. “I think it’s very important to have groups like the HDA put in the work and try to grow the game that way, and try to educate kids about racism in the sport, in life, in general.”

The HDA was born during the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020, following the killing of George Floyd by a White police officer in Minnesota. Led by six players, including Aliu, the group pledged to encourage more diverse growth at grassroots levels of hockey while also holding the NHL’s feet to the fire on social justice issues.

When the league resumed play on Aug. 1, then-Minnesota Wild defenseman and HDA founding member Matt Dumba delivered a live pregame speech raising attention to racial injustice before kneeling during the U.S. national anthem. Later that month, after the fatal shooting of Jacob Blake by a White police officer in Wisconsin, HDA members led the way in criticizing the NHL for continuing to play, even as other leagues paused in protest. The NHL eventually followed suit and postponed games.

“I know they probably don’t want to give us credit for it, but I think we made the NHL do a few different things,” Simmonds said. “I think we spurred a lot of change. You see the NHL trying to come together and get their grassroots stuff going, a lot of different entities have started to do the same thing as well, right? But we started this in 2020, I think, before anyone was really doing anything like this.”

To run their free grassroots hockey clinics today, according to Aliu, the HDA annually spends CA$1.5 million on ice time, registration, coaches, travel and food, among other expenses. Not included is the cost of gear for participating youth — that is covered by equipment maker CCM, one of the coalition’s most prominent backers.

But the HDA’s broader corporate sponsorship base has dwindled in recent years, with only CCM, Canadian Tire and JumpStart remaining. As a result of these losses, which included Scotiabank Canada, Budweiser Canada and Kraft Heinz Canada, the HDA has been forced to slash its operating budget by 70 percent over the past two years.

According to Aliu, these companies most commonly cited a shifting financial focus in explaining their decisions not to renew their respective contracts with the HDA. But Aliu suspects different motivations.

“I think they wanted to be part of something that was trendy at the time,” he told The Athletic. “In a lot of ways, we were used by some of these organizations.

“I get emotional about it because brown and Black people have been largely overlooked and marginalized for so many years. So we thought, obviously following the 2020, kind of George Floyd movement and civil rights movement, that people were really serious about the cause, but now we see that, once again, people of color were used.”

Scotiabank Canada, Kraft Heinz Canada and Budweiser Canada could not be reached for comment by The Athletic. Scotiabank currently sponsors three NHL teams and owns the naming rights to the Maple Leafs’ arena. Kraft Heinz annually partners with the NHL and NHL Players’ Association to fund community hockey programs through its “Kraft Hockeyville” initiative. Budweiser signed an agreement to become an official beer sponsor of the NHL in Canada last year.

The year before the HDA launched, in 2019-20, the NHL had 18 Black players and fewer than two dozen players of color. Slowly but surely, that number is changing.

A record-setting 20 players of Black, Indigenous, Asian or Latin descent were selected in June’s NHL Draft, including two Black first-rounders in Kashawn Aitcheson (New York Islanders) and Bill Zonnon (Pittsburgh Penguins). They followed 12 players of color who were chosen during the 2024 draft in Las Vegas, including three Black players in the first round.

“I think it’s a direct correlation to organizations like us doing the real work at the grassroots level, and then the NHL bearing the fruits of that labor,” Aliu said.

Some HDA members anecdotally remarked that they have noticed White fellow NHLers becoming more aware of the issues facing their sport over the past five years. But Simmonds thinks more can be done to integrate players from underrepresented backgrounds into hockey social groups, touting the upcoming removal of the league’s official dress code in the newly signed collective bargaining agreement as a potential starting point.

“A lot of people, they’ve got to change who they are to be accepted into a hockey circle,” Simmonds said. “And now that everything’s loosening up and people are starting to realize it’s not such a white-collar sport, people are going to be allowed to be themselves. It’s just going to go a long way, allowing people that can play the sport, be themselves and not have to hide who they are, right?

“I think that’ll make people more comfortable and bring out their true talents, and allow a lot of people of different ethnicities to actually come and play our game and enjoy our game, and not leave after one or two years of experiencing it.”

But, Aliu admitted, that might only become a reality if more people warm to the HDA’s message.

“I think hockey has the most potential to grow out of any of the major four sports,” he said. “And I think there’s nobody that would argue that. But I think we need to be honest about where we are as a sport and where the sport is going. And until we do that, I don’t know if we’re going to be able to address the real issue of growing the game.”

Back at SummerFest, with the CN Tower as its backdrop, the HDA ended its event with an outdoor ball hockey game featuring players and local celebrities. Kids and parents alike hung around the boards, drinking water to keep cool in the summer heat yet unable to take their eyes off the star-studded talent jogging up and down the floor.

Whether it was Kadri and Simmonds creating plays and scoring goals, or Thomas finding one of the Smith brothers with a cross-floor pass, the action marked a chance for many children present to see players who look like them playing a sport they love. It’s a vision the HDA continues to push for — at the grassroots level and beyond.

Following their long-awaited reunion, the band revealed a special collaboration with McDonald’s: a celebratory TinyTAN Happy Meal. The fast-food chain teased the promotion earlier this month, confirming that it will officially launch Sept. 3.

The meal will follow the standard McDonald’s Happy Meal menu: a four-piece Chicken McNuggets or a hamburger, fries or apple slices and a beverage. The difference comes with the addition of collectible miniature figures of each BTS member. The name TinyTAN plays on both the toys’ small size and BTS’s Korean name, Bangtan Sonyeondan.

The announcement of the meal has received mixed reactions. Many fans expressed excitement, with one writing on social media, “Omg nooooo stop I’m literally gonna cry on how cute this is @mcdonalds.” For some in the BTS ARMY (the name of the fanbase), the collaboration carries a sense of nostalgia, as the group was previously known for its BT21 merchandise and other collectible items before their hiatus. BTS also partnered with McDonald’s in 2021 for a special meal inspired by menu items in McDonald’s South Korea.

At the same time, some fans voiced disappointment over the partnership, citing concerns about McDonald’s past involvement in the Israel-Gaza conflict. McDonald’s has stated that the corporation itself has not taken a position in the conflict and does not provide support to either side. However, controversy arose in 2023 when McDonald’s Israel donated meals to Israeli soldiers, prompting backlash and calls for boycotts in several countries.

BTS stepping into the global spotlight once again is exciting for fans all over.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the association of the country’s leading retailers, has sent a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves warning of a possible escalation in prices. The organization has assured that in order to avoid a greater impact of inflation on the country’s households, it is necessary to reduce the tax burden on the sector.

“In order to increase the investment sought by the government, support local employment and help alleviate the pressure on prices, it is essential that these changes translate into a significant reduction in the tax burden on the sector,“ explains the text sent to the Labor policy. It goes on to highlight the need for “no store to pay more as a result”.

The BRC has especially shown its concern around Reeves’ possible plans to reformulate some of the taxes related to commercial premises, and which would seek to increase the payments of larger surface establishments. “The Labor party promised to create new jobs and improve living standards, but if policy decisions lead to higher prices and a consequent reduction in employment, those commitments are at risk,“ the bank warned.

British trade warns that last year 100,000 jobs were destroyed in the sector

In the letter, the BRC puts the inflation forecast for food alone at up to 6% at the end of the year, while warning that last year up to 100,000 jobs were already destroyed in the sector. In this regard, the entity points out that the previous year’s budget, Reeves’ first and which already caused a confrontation between retailers and the minister, already added an extra cost of 7,000 million pounds sterling.

“Food prices, which had started to fall, are rising again,“ the BRC has explained; “and in its latest report, the Bank of England said that food price inflation has also picked up more than expected, and is expected to rise further. The group has admitted that a large part of this rise is due to the increase of the prices all over the world, but it emphasizes also to higher labor costs.

In her previous budgets, one of the most controversial measures within the sector was the updating of the National Insurance Scheme (NIC). The minister proposed a rise from 13.8% to 15% in the social security contribution, along with a reduction in the secondary threshold, or the point at which employers are obliged to pay social security for their employees.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6IjEuMDIifQ/files/2025/redaccion-personas/rachel-reeves-presupuestos-1200.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:05:10.466605

In this market, state regulators scrutinize insurers’ proposed rate increases, but only if they exceed 15%.
In Washington, the average proposed increase across all insurers is 21.2%, and in Rhode Island it’s 23.7%.
Large employers that manage their own health care plans might be able to negotiate better deals for their workers.
If voters paid as much attention to the price of health insurance as they do to the cost of gas and eggs, maybe elected officials would respond with more action.","Wary of inflation, Americans have been watching the prices of everyday items such as eggs and gasoline. A less-noticed expense should cause greater alarm: rising premiums for health insurance. They have been trending upward for years and are now rising faster than ever.

Consider that, from 2000 to 2020, egg prices fluctuated between just under $1 and about $3 a dozen; they reached $6.23 in March but then fell to $3.78 in June. Average gas prices, after seesawing between $2 and $4 a gallon for more than a decade starting in 2005, peaked at $4.93 in 2022 and recently fell back to just over $3.

Meanwhile, since 1999, health insurance premiums for people with employer-provided coverage have more than quadrupled. From 2023 to 2024 alone, they rose more than 6% for both individuals and family coverage — a steeper increase than that of wages and overall inflation.

For many people who have the kind of insurance plans created by the Affordable Care Act (because they work for small companies or insure themselves), rates have probably risen even more drastically. In this market, state regulators scrutinize insurers’ proposed rate increases, but only if they exceed 15%.

And the situation is about to get worse: For 2026, ACA marketplace insurers have proposed eye-popping new prices: In New York, UnitedHealthcare has proposed a 66.4% rise. HMO Colorado has asked for an average increase of more than 33% in that state. In Washington, the average proposed increase across all insurers is 21.2%, and in Rhode Island it’s 23.7%.

According to Business Group on Health, a consortium of major employers, “actual health care costs have grown a cumulative 50% since 2017.” In a separate survey published in 2021, 87% of companies said that in the next five to 10 years, the cost of providing health insurance for their workers would become “unsustainable.”

And insurers in the ACA marketplace are increasing premiums by an average of 20% for next year, according to a new analysis. Imagine if tens of millions of Americans’ rent or mortgage payments were to suddenly increase by that amount.

Insurance regulators theoretically could demand that these proposed rates be lowered — and this often happens. But some states are more active than others in this regard. And all are wary that too much regulatory interference could drive insurers from their markets.

Insurers offer many explanations for their calculations, some of which are tied to recent actions by Congress and President Donald Trump. New tariffs on America’s trading partners, for example, are expected to push up the cost of drugs and medical supplies.

Meanwhile, reductions in health care spending included in the GOP budget bill, along with the expiration of some Biden-era premium subsidies at the end of this year, will cause many people to lose their health insurance. About 16 million Americans are expected to become uninsured in 2034, in many cases because keeping insurance will become unaffordable.

Because most of these people are likely to be young and/or healthy, the “risk pool” of those remaining insured will become older and sicker — and therefore more expensive to cover.

“Ultimately, we believe the ACA market will likely be smaller and higher acuity-driven next year,” Janey Kiryluik, vice president of corporate communications for Elevance Health (formerly known as Anthem), wrote in an email. She added: “Our position reflects early disciplined action.”

Remember, most insurers in the United States are public, for-profit companies; as such, they tend to act in the interests of their shareholders, not the patients whose health care they cover.

Large employers that manage their own health care plans might be able to negotiate better deals for their workers. But smaller companies, for the most part, will need to accept what’s on offer.

Premiums are not the only part of health insurance that’s getting more expensive. Deductibles — the money that beneficiaries must spend out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in — are also rising. The average deductible for a standard ACA silver plan in 2025 was nearly $5,000, about double what it was in 2014. (For those with employer-based insurance, the average number is just under $2,000.)

A few states are trying to stem the tide by offering a state-run “public option,” a basic affordable insurance plan that patients can choose. But they have struggled because a lower payment rate for workers generally means fewer participating providers and reduced access to care.

The collective is the brainchild of Polaris, a Jill-of-all-trades with a backstory as intriguing as the drag shows she produces.
As for her experience with drag, Polaris had dabbled during her time in NYC, but it wasn't until after the pandemic that she considered producing her own shows in Tokyo.
Wanting to make her events stand out, she had the novel idea of combining drag with another of her many interests: environmental activism.
The show's theme is 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle' and will welcome a dozen drag performers to strut their stuff on the stage.","Let's face it: the planet is pretty much on fire. From rising sea temperatures and dying coral reefs to rapid deforestation and all manner of pollution, humanity's effects on nature have been devastating to say the least. With so much destruction happening to our natural world, it can seem nearly impossible to effect any meaningful change. But that hasn't stopped Queens for a Cause.

Established in 2023, Queens for a Cause is a Tokyo-based, queer-run organisation that puts on several drag shows throughout the year featuring local and international talent. Each themed show is dedicated to a specific environmental cause, toward which QFAC donates a portion of its earnings. Whether it's saving pollinators, protecting polar ice caps or cleaning up our oceans and beaches, QFAC donates to a wide variety of organisations that dedicate themselves to helping the planet.

The collective is the brainchild of Polaris, a Jill-of-all-trades with a backstory as intriguing as the drag shows she produces. The American flight attendant spent her youth working on a farm in Connecticut before studying dance in New York. While in the Big Apple, she landed internships working in the fashion closet at Allure and the accessories closet at Vogue, among other places. The travel bug eventually brought her to Japan in 2013, where she would remain for over a decade working with special needs children.

As for her experience with drag, Polaris had dabbled during her time in NYC, but it wasn't until after the pandemic that she considered producing her own shows in Tokyo. Wanting to make her events stand out, she had the novel idea of combining drag with another of her many interests: environmental activism. To help bring her vision to life, Polaris recruited her close friend, veteran performer and experienced event producer Stefani St Slut.

Within just a few months, Queens for a Cause was born. The group's debut show – entitled 'Global Crisis' – premiered November 2023 and raised over ¥60,000 for the Environmental Defense Fund. Since then, the group has raised over ¥1 million for nine different local and international organisations. Each show now brings in around 60-70 attendees, and numbers only continue to grow as the performers find new ways to keep audience members entertained, all while enlightening them on global issues.

'When someone like [drag performer] Meringue can tell a story about love and death while portraying a fig wasp and teaching about the importance of pollinators, you know you have something special', says Polaris regarding the popularity of the unique performances.

'The queer community is specially equipped to deal with injustice, as we experience it all our lives and it's woven into the fabric of our history,' she continues. 'Drag and simply being queer is activism in and of itself, so I think when you connect that sensibility with a cause that really affects all people, not just the gays, it creates an even bigger sense of import and connectedness. I wanted to harness the gay community's power into a direction that wasn't just about us, but about our global community as a whole.'

Polaris's vision has certainly paid off. Queens for a Cause has recently attracted the attention of a big-name global NGO as a new collaborator, whose name will be revealed during the group's upcoming two-year anniversary on November 15 at Gyoen Rosso 198. The show's theme is 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle' and will welcome a dozen drag performers to strut their stuff on the stage.",https://media.timeout.com/images/106308924/image.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:05:25.034888

By 2030, the market is projected to reach USD 31.52 billion (CAGR of 5.1%) or USD 11.35 billion (CAGR of 7.34%) depending on the forecast model, with the 2025–2030 period representing a critical inflection point. For investors, the convergence of aging populations, personalized nutrition advancements, and strategic moves by industry leaders like Nestlé, Abbott, and Danone presents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on long-term growth.

Demographic Tailwinds: Aging Populations as a Catalyst

The aging demographic is the bedrock of this market's expansion. By 2040, the U.S. population aged 65+ is expected to rise from 17.3% in 2022 to 22%, a trend mirrored in Europe and Asia. Older adults are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions such as diabetes (38.4 million cases in the U.S. alone), Parkinson's disease (90,000 new diagnoses annually), and cardiovascular disorders. These conditions often require long-term nutritional interventions, which are increasingly administered at home.

North America dominates the market with a 34.38% share in 2023, supported by 11,353 active home healthcare agencies in the U.S. and robust reimbursement frameworks. However, the Asia Pacific is emerging as a high-growth region, with Japan's per capita medical care costs for elderly patients reaching USD 6,792.1—a testament to the financial prioritization of home-based care.

Disease-Specific Innovation: The New Frontier

The shift from generic to condition-targeted nutrition is reshaping the industry. Companies are now developing formulations tailored to diseases like diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and oncology. For example:

- Abbott invested USD 2.741 billion in 2023 for R&D, including diabetes-specific enteral formulas and oncology nutrition solutions.

- Nestlé partnered with Global Shapers and Accenture in 2024 to innovate youth-focused clinical nutrition, while its Nutricia division launched a pediatric malnutrition drink in 2023.

- Danone (via Nutricia) and FrieslandCampina are advancing liquid-based products, such as heat-stable whey protein (Nutri Whey ProHeat), which improve bioavailability and ease of administration.

Liquid formulations are gaining traction due to their adaptability for personalized needs, such as pediatric patients or those with swallowing difficulties. This trend aligns with the broader shift toward home-based care, where ease of use and compliance are critical.

Strategic Moves by Market Leaders

The top three players—Nestlé, Abbott, and Danone—are leveraging R&D, acquisitions, and partnerships to solidify their dominance:

1. Abbott acquired ZOIA Pharma in 2023 to expand its advanced medical nutrition portfolio.

2. Nestlé is integrating AI and digital health tools to personalize nutrition plans, as seen in its 2024 collaboration with Accenture.

3. Danone is focusing on plant-based and functional foods, addressing sustainability and health trends.

Challenges and Opportunities

While reimbursement limitations and high costs for specialized products pose hurdles, the market is adapting. For instance, the U.S. FDA's Healthcare At Home initiative promotes home-based clinical nutrition to reduce hospital readmissions, indirectly improving reimbursement viability. Additionally, the rise of telehealth and AI-driven nutrition monitoring systems is enhancing patient outcomes, making these solutions more attractive to payers.

Investors should also note the Asia Pacific's potential. Countries like China and India are witnessing rapid urbanization and rising healthcare expenditure, creating fertile ground for homecare clinical nutrition.

Investment Thesis: Positioning for Long-Term Growth

For long-term investors, the key is to align with companies that:

1. Lead in R&D: Prioritize firms with robust pipelines for disease-specific and liquid formulations.

2. Expand Geographically: Target players with a strong presence in North America and emerging markets like Asia Pacific.

3. Leverage Digital Health: Invest in companies integrating AI and telehealth to enhance personalization and compliance.

Nestlé, Abbott, and Danone are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. However, smaller innovators like Pentec Health (post-ZOIA acquisition) and FrieslandCampina may offer higher growth potential for risk-tolerant investors.

ID25,McDonald’s,2025-08-22 10:08:21+00:00,MSNBC.com,Even McDonald's knows Americans are struggling with Trump's tariffs,James Downie,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-tariffs-mcdonalds-combo-meal-price-cuts-rcna226368,"In case the company’s rationale of a “challenging economic environment” wasn’t a clear enough link to the tariffs, the increase only applies to U.S. consumers.
Sony’s video game rivals have already raised prices, with Microsoft bumping its Xbox Series X by $100 and Nintendo increasing prices for its Switch and increasing prices for the accessories for the new Switch 2.
Home Depot announced Tuesday that it will begin raising prices due to tariffs, after previously holding out against such increases.
With so much money at the top, raising prices and targeting the wealthy few is a far more viable strategy for many businesses than lowering prices and broadening the customer base.
The party needs to settle on a plan that can be implemented swiftly and at scale after Trump’s renewed failure.","It’s not every day that McDonald’s announces it is cutting prices. But on Thursday, the fast-food giant said it will reduce the price of its combo meals. “The move is part of the chain’s push to restore its reputation for affordability, which has taken a hit with cash-strapped consumers,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “Restaurants, particularly fast-food chains, are struggling to attract customers worn down by inflation and unsure about the U.S. economy.”

But while McDonald’s tries to make amends to those “worn down” consumers, other big corporations are still increasing prices — thanks to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

For example, on Wednesday, Sony announced that it is raising the price of its Playstation 5 video game console by $50 even though historically, video games consoles only get cheaper more than four years after their release. In case the company’s rationale of a “challenging economic environment” wasn’t a clear enough link to the tariffs, the increase only applies to U.S. consumers. Sony’s video game rivals have already raised prices, with Microsoft bumping its Xbox Series X by $100 and Nintendo increasing prices for its Switch and increasing prices for the accessories for the new Switch 2.

Home Depot announced Tuesday that it will begin raising prices due to tariffs, after previously holding out against such increases. Late last month, Procter and Gamble (which makes dozens of household brands) said it would raise prices for 25% of its U.S. product lineup. And Thursday morning, Walmart said it had begun raising prices, with Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey telling CNBC that “tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.”

While these big names get the headlines, of course, small businesses — which have less flexibility to handle the tariffs — are raising their prices as well. With consumers “more sensitive and suspicious of corporate greed, especially after years of inflation,” Marketplace reports, “companies are looking for targeted ways to raise prices that can sometimes seem sneaky” — such as cutting free shipping or adding service fees. As Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell noted, “some companies will certainly be taking advantage” of the tariffs to raise prices even when they’re not affected — just as many companies pushed prices higher during the pandemic, whether or not they were affected by supply chain issues.

On top of all these price hikes, electricity costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation, and housing remains unaffordable for millions. As we expected, Trump’s promises to bring down prices, which he repeated so often during the election last year, have proven to be empty.

But voters haven’t forgotten those promises. No wonder then that, amid Trump’s broader slide in the polls, his standing on specific issues has declined most precipitously on inflation. Meanwhile, from Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger to New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Democrats have found success running on lowering the cost of living.

But simply reversing the tariffs wouldn’t solve Americans’ struggles with inflation. “The ‘K-shaped’ economy is back, where there’s a clear divergence between how the top and the bottom are faring,” Washington Post contributing columnist Heather Long wrote this month. “Any company that can is trying to go ‘upmarket’ as much as possible in this environment.” The top 10% of households by income (those making $250,000 or more a year) now account for roughly half of all consumer spending, according to Moody’s Analytics, up from 36% three decades ago. With so much money at the top, raising prices and targeting the wealthy few is a far more viable strategy for many businesses than lowering prices and broadening the customer base.

Americans’ swiftly souring views of Trump’s handling of inflation are a reminder that, should they retake power, Democrats will not have much of a grace period to ease voters’ pocketbook struggles. The party needs to settle on a plan that can be implemented swiftly and at scale after Trump’s renewed failure. The electorate is angry, the scale of the problem is massive, and the relief needed is urgent. But the rewards for the party that finally delivers that relief should be enormous.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250612-shoppers-grocery-ew-611p-80c335.jpg",N,,2025-08-22 07:05:10.942076

Ahead of the 2025/2026 La Liga season, FC Barcelona sought new opportunities to upgrade Pitch 1, with the introduction of a state-of-the-art display system to bring new visual capabilities and detailed analysis to the touchline for both coaching and playing staff. Now known as Camp Tito Vilanova, Pitch 1 is the first team’s official training area, featuring an 11-a-side (105 x 68m) pitch, a 4,643m2 warm-up area, and a 1,400 capacity terrace.

To support their vision, the club teamed up with PPDS, together with local LED integration expert, LED Dream, for the project, installing a 5.5 x 3m Philips Urban LED 7000 Series LED wall located just beyond the touchline, tailored precisely around the club’s night and day needs.

With 6,000 nits of high brightness, the 3.9pp Philips Urban LED 7000 Series LED wall was the standout choice for this exciting project, capable of standing up to the rigours of all weather and lighting conditions in the Catalonian capital, whether heavy rain, direct sunlight or floodlight glare. The 7000 Series also includes an IP66 rating, resistant to dust and corrosive airborne salt spray from the nearby Mediterranean sea.

The Philips Urban LED 7000 Series installation was completed efficiently and on time, with minimal disruption to the team’s training schedule and seamless integration into the stadium infrastructure.

Cesar Sans, sales director for Iberia at PPDS, commented: “The display isn’t just an opportunity for the coaching team or those in attendance to get a clearer view of the action. It provides new, deeper levels of analysis, from player data to tactical decisions which could be the difference between success and failure.”

Jae O Choi Park, head of commercial EMEA for PPDS concluded: “We are delighted FC Barcelona recognised the quality and capabilities of Philips Professional Displays, and the possibilities they can provide. When it comes to quality, we do not accept second best and, as history tells you, neither does FC Barcelona.”",https://www.lsionline.com/templates/ja_focus/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-22 07:05:49.679733

Ralph Lauren's stock is currently facing a bearish trend with a price fall of -0.97%, while analyst expectations remain optimistic, according to our internal diagnostic scores (0-10).

News Highlights

Walmart's Agentic AI Strategy: Walmart's embrace of agentic AI in retail might influence consumer shopping habits and could indirectly impact Ralph Lauren's online and in-store strategies.

Nykaa's Retail Expansion: Nykaa's aggressive expansion in India's beauty and fashion retail space suggests that retail expansion and physical presence remain key growth strategies in fashion, which could be a lesson for Ralph Lauren.

Modine's Acquisition: Modine's $112 million acquisition of a heating solutions company highlights the importance of strategic acquisitions in enhancing operational capabilities, a factor that could be relevant for Ralph Lauren's own strategic considerations.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The current average analyst rating is 4.30, while the performance-weighted rating stands at 4.56, indicating a generally positive outlook. However, these ratings are mismatched with the current price trend of a price fall.

Key Fundamental Factors:

PE (Price to Earnings): 152.46 (internal diagnostic score: 3)

PB (Price to Book): 3.32 (internal diagnostic score: 2)

PCF (Price to Cash Flow): 231.99 (internal diagnostic score: 2)

EV/EBIT: 93.87 (internal diagnostic score: 1)

Operating Cycle: 206.51 (internal diagnostic score: 2)

ROE (Return on Equity) with PB: 2.39 (internal diagnostic score: 2)

Cash-UP (Cash to Usage Proportion): -1.06 (internal diagnostic score: 3)

Asset-MV (Asset to Market Value): -0.88 (internal diagnostic score: 3)

Cash-MV (Cash to Market Value): -1.51 (internal diagnostic score: 4)

The overall fundamental score is 6.69, suggesting a moderately strong financial profile. Notably, several analysts have strong historical performance, including Dana Telsey (69.2% win rate) and Ike Boruchow (62.5% win rate).

Money-Flow Trends

The overall fund flow trend is negative, with an overall inflow ratio of 0.4926. Despite this, medium and small inflow ratios are positive (0.5049 and 0.5118 respectively), suggesting a divergence between retail and institutional investor sentiment. Large and extra-large flows are negative (0.5018 and 0.4838 respectively), which may indicate a cautious stance from major investors.

Key Technical Signals

Ralph Lauren's technical indicators are showing a mixed picture, with a technical score of 4.86 (internal diagnostic score). Here's a breakdown of key signals:

WR Overbought: Score of 6.39 (internal diagnostic score) indicates a neutral rise.

Long Lower Shadow: Score of 8.13 (internal diagnostic score) suggests strong bullish potential.

Bearish Engulfing: Score of 1.62 (internal diagnostic score) shows a biased bearish signal.

MACD Death Cross: Score of 6.84 (internal diagnostic score) indicates a neutral rise.

Earnings Release Date: Score of 4.57 (internal diagnostic score) suggests a neutral rise.

Marubozu White: Score of 1.61 (internal diagnostic score) indicates a neutral bias.

Recent chart patterns include a Long Lower Shadow and Earnings Release Date on 2025-08-07, and a WR Overbought pattern on 2025-08-13. These signals suggest a volatile market with unclear direction.

Conclusion

Investors should remain cautious given the mixed technical and fundamental indicators. The recent volatility and mismatch between analyst expectations and price trends suggest that waiting for a clearer direction or a pull-back before making a move could be wise. Additionally, keep an eye on upcoming earnings and strategic developments, as they could offer key insights into Ralph Lauren's potential trajectory.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 07:06:03.590549

The jersey forms part of Nike's new ""Total 90"" throwback range and as such features styling directly influenced by those popular designs of the mid-2000s. We have the shield-shaped piping, the central crest positioning and the sort of pointy collars and trim that was commonplace two decades ago.

Chelsea actually wore Umbro and Adidas kits during the period in question, but Nike are still keen to draw on the success of the period. In case you need reminding, Mourinho arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2004 having just shocked Europe by winning the UEFA Champions League with FC Porto and led his pugnacious Blues team to six trophies in three years.

The dark design is a specific reference to the away kits worn by the Blues during their momentous 2004-05 campaign. With summer signings like Petr Cech, Ricardo Carvalho Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba joining established stars like John Terry, Claude Makélélé and Frank Lampard, the self-declared ""special one"" created a defiant team in his own image. Mourinho delivered a historic Premier League title at Stamford Bridge, the club's first league title in 50 years, as well as winning the League Cup to boot.

However, after retaining the title the following year, things eventually turned sour and Mourinho left in 2007 after a fallout with then-owner Roman Abramovich in 2007. But that didn't stop the Portuguese tactician returning in 2013 to do it all again after spells at Internazionale and Real Madrid, winning a third league title before another acrimonious departure.

Starbucks’ Caps a 2% Raise for All Salaried Employees in North America Starbucks confirmed the flat 2% pay raise earlier this week, applicable to all salaried employees in North America.
The reason for this merit-free pay raise?
While a guaranteed hike in pay is typically a good thing, the flat 2% pay raise leaves much to be desired.
The “Back to Starbucks” turnaround strategy is an expansive one that marks a bold step away from the organization’s approach in the years before.","Starbucks’ turnaround strategy has been the talk of the town ever since CEO Brian Niccol took over leadership of the company last year. As part of the most recent change in its operations, Starbucks has announced a 2% raise for all salaried employees in North America, opting for a merit-free pay raise strategy in 2025. Niccol’s cost control raises are an interesting strategy as they will limit any variations in the pay expected by workers hoping for a raise this year.

While the uniformity may be a boon for some, the flat 2% pay raise is likely to be lower than the bump up many workers were hoping to see. The proposed raise also lags behind the U.S. inflation rate of 2.7% and the average salary increases that are being offered by other businesses, which could result in several disappointed workers.

Starbucks’ Caps a 2% Raise for All Salaried Employees in North America

Starbucks confirmed the flat 2% pay raise earlier this week, applicable to all salaried employees in North America. Bloomberg News stated that the raise will apply to all corporate staff, workers from manufacturing and distribution, as well as store managers. Hourly wage workers are not expected to benefit from this change. The reason for this merit-free pay raise? The company is capping expenses in order to “carefully manage all [its] other costs.”

In previous years, managers were allowed to contribute to the decision of individual pay raises for workers under their wings, but for 2025, Niccol’s cost-controlled raises will limit how much employees can seek during their annual discussions on pay. For now, it is difficult to gauge employee response to this move. While a guaranteed hike in pay is typically a good thing, the flat 2% pay raise leaves much to be desired.

Starbucks has also been embroiled in contract negotiations with its unionized workers, and it appears to be far from reaching a satisfactory agreement with them, despite the considerable time that has passed since the union was established. According to Reuters, the union previously rejected a proposal that guaranteed annual raises of at least 2%, which shows the general sentiment around Starbucks’ 2% raise.

How Does Starbucks’ Pay Policy Change Figure Into Its Turnaround Strategy?

The “Back to Starbucks” turnaround strategy is an expansive one that marks a bold step away from the organization’s approach in the years before. Determined to increase the foot traffic in stores and turn Starbucks’ outlets into community hubs, the company has attempted to make strategic changes to improve the in-store experience. This has come with a renewed focus on its green-aproned workers.

Some changes, like the improvements to the parental leave policy, have been well-received by the staff. On the other hand, other aspects, like the emphasis on 4-day RTO policies for corporate employees and changes to the barista dress code, have resulted in outspoken resistance. To continue with the ambitions to curb expenses, Starbucks is also reportedly exploring a zero-based budgeting strategy, where managers will have to justify their costs and expenses rather than rely on the budget from a previous year in order to make a case for themselves.

Starbucks’ 2% raise strategy is not a considerable hike based on available data, with a Korn Ferry survey suggesting that an average 3.6% increase in salary is expected to be offered this year. We expect that with merit-based raises being replaced, Starbucks will have some disgruntled employees on its hands. The company will have to explore alternative strategies for guaranteeing active retention to hold on to its talent—if this continues to be a goal, of course.

Are Merit-Free Pay Raises a Good Idea?

With economic uncertainties prevailing in the market, tariffs poised to hike costs, and Starbucks’ own expenses resulting from the turnaround plan looming over the business, it’s no surprise that the company is opting to play it safe and conserve its resources for other investments. Data shows that workers are unlikely to quit in large numbers in the coming months, making it easier for Starbucks to commit to the strategy without fearing a mass quitting event.

However, counting on fear to keep employees seated at their desks is a risky strategy. Disgruntled employees aren’t ideal employees, and a slight shift in the job market could result in a mass exodus of the workforce. Standardizing benefits to ensure all workers are fairly rewarded in addition to their pay can be a good idea, but offering limited merit-free pay raises does take some of the motivation out of the equation.

Aware that stellar performance is unlikely to be fairly compensated, workers might be lulled into a false sense of complacency, where they don’t have to push themselves to perform to the best of their abilities in order to keep their jobs. This might work in the short term, but eventually, the organization will have to look at other forms of compensation for high performers to keep them driven towards a common goal.",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Starbucks-2-raise.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:13:13.854952

With over half of sports fans now relying on AI or generative AI as their primary source of information, and 67% seeking a single platform to access aggregated content, TryZone IQ will provide timely, relevant insights to support editorial storytelling and enhance the viewing experience for both dedicated and new audiences.

Leveraging its expertise in tech, data, and AI, Capgemini developed TryZone IQ to give rugby fans the context they need to better understand the game. In collaboration with World Rugby and Opta, Capgemini studied fan behavior and preferences to shape features that convert raw data into concise narratives.

Historic and live match data is updated every minute such as player actions, team dynamics, and match statistics. This data is processed by a generative AI engine to produce concise, informative, text-based summaries for analysts during the live broadcasts.

TryZone IQ is designed with effective human-AI collaboration at its core, augmenting the editorial workflow for rugby analysts who can select and refine the generated insights, remaining in control of what insights are generated.

Insights can be used to support live commentary or seamlessly integrated across digital platforms and social channels, delivering smarter, context-rich updates to elevate the fan viewing experience, and enabling fans to access match insights in real time.

Steven Webb, UK Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, Capgemini said, “As women’s rugby reaches new heights and the World Cup draws global attention, we felt there was a unique opportunity to apply innovation to make the game more engaging for a broader fanbase. With TryZone IQ, we’re infusing the transformative power of generative AI into the heart of the game to meet the expectations of fans today who are looking for real-time stories, context, and clarity as they follow the sport. It is a great example of how innovation can help fans feel closer to the action, while enhancing their overall experience and enjoyment along the way.”

Together with World Rugby and Opta, Capgemini also contributed towards the conceptual development for two new on-screen visualizations designed to enhance viewer understanding of key moments as they unfold. “Expected Tries” uses the same approach seen within football with ‘xG’[2] to show fans how many try-scoring opportunities have been created compared to actual tries scored. “Attacking threat” also translates live metrics, such as possession, territory and momentum, into a simple percentage power-bar on screen that reveals who is currently dominating play so most likely to score.

Women’s rugby is growing rapidly around the world, with over 20 million viewers expected to tune in for the Women’s Rugby World Cup 2025. This expansion is bringing new audiences and fresh perspectives to the sport, attracting first-time viewers who are discovering the thrill of rugby for the first time.

Rugby’s history is steeped in tradition, strategy, and stories that define the sport. Capgemini’s AI-driven insights aim to support this momentum by converting complex match data into clear, engaging insights that enhance the story and excitement of each match, helping new fans connect with the sport from their very first viewing experience.

“Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises,” said Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the EU. The succession of recent crises that have buffeted the continent — from the pandemic to the energy shock and the war in Ukraine — may finally have acted as a catalyst.

The Draghi and Letta reports of 2024, followed by the European Commission’s “competitiveness compass” and savings and investments union initiatives this year, demonstrate that the EU has undertaken thorough introspection and appears ready to address its weaknesses. If it succeeds in doing so, it could unlock its potential, bringing its equity market along with it.

The European project was founded on stability and strong transatlantic ties. However, with doubts growing amid rising US isolationism, Europe is increasingly looking inward. Defence budgets are rising — EU members spent €326bn in 2024, or 1.9 per cent of GDP, with more increases anticipated.

The “ReArm Europe” programme aims to mobilise up to €800bn, reflecting a new focus on strategic autonomy. At the Nato summit in June 2025, allies committed to investing 5 per cent of GDP in defence by 2035 — including 3.5 per cent on core defence capabilities and 1.5 per cent on defence- and security-related investments. This marks a significant increase from the previous 2 per cent target.

Yet sovereignty in the 21st century is not secured by arms alone. The energy crisis exposed the fragility of Europe’s reliance on Russian gas. The pivot to US liquefied natural gas brought relief, but also new dependencies.

In response, Europe is maintaining its green transition, pushing for investment in renewables and even nuclear power. Initiatives like REPowerEU, nested within the Green Deal, are indispensable for Europe’s competitiveness. For investors, these measures are crucial because energy security and prices are fundamental to European corporate margins, as demonstrated during the energy crisis.

Technology is another key pillar of this sovereignty drive. Mario Draghi highlighted that the productivity gap between the EU and the US is largely due to the tech sector. The pandemic exposed Europe’s reliance on Asian semiconductors, leading to the €86bn European Chips Act. Investments in artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, such as the €30–50bn data centre initiative in France, are crucial seeds for data sovereignty.

“The ECB estimates that aligning deposit-to-investment ratios with US levels could unlock €350bn annually for productive investment.”

Each step towards technological autonomy also helps restore investor confidence in Europe’s capacity for innovation and its ability to regain competitiveness.

At the heart of this transformation lies Europe’s capital market. EU households hold €10tn in bank deposits — safe, but largely stagnant. The European Central Bank estimates that aligning deposit-to-investment ratios with US levels could unlock €350bn annually for productive investment.

In March, the commission launched the savings and investments union, aiming to channel this dormant capital into the real economy. The SIU seeks to build a financing ecosystem capable of supporting Europe’s ambitions and, crucially, revitalising its equity markets. To this end, the new “Finance Europe” label encourages savers to invest in local equities.

Currently, only 17 per cent of EU household assets are invested in securities, compared to 43 per cent in the US. If successful, this initiative would not only bring new investment to corporates and greater returns to EU households but also increase inflows into European equities.

All these initiatives demonstrate that the continent is becoming aware of its vulnerabilities and is organising to address them. The political shift is concrete, as exemplified by Germany’s announcement of a massive €500bn investment programme in energy, the military, and infrastructure.

Certainly, the challenges are immense, but if Europe manages to sustain this momentum, it will not only reduce its dependencies but also enhance the attractiveness of European equities, particularly in strategic sectors essential to its autonomy and sovereignty.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/29082436-78fd-4a55-9332-6d5a641eb547.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 08:03:31.383278

In patients with angina with nonobstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA), routine ad hoc coronary function testing (CFT) during initial invasive angiography combined with a disease-specific treatment identified coronary vasomotor disorders and facilitated the management of angina and quality of life.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers reported findings from a prospective trial conducted across five cardiac centers in the Netherlands and Germany to assess the clinical utility of routine ad hoc CFT in patients with ANOCA.

A total of 153 adults with ANOCA (median age, 64 years; 55% women) underwent CFT during their initial invasive coronary angiography.

Patients were randomly assigned either to an intervention group, wherein CFT results were disclosed and used to guide tailored treatment, or to a standard care group, wherein CFT results were masked and care followed guideline-based therapy at the cardiologist’s discretion.

Researchers assessed the impact of angina on quality of life of patients using patient-reported data from the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ).

The primary outcome was the mean difference between groups in change in the SAQ summary score from baseline to 6 months of follow-up.

TAKEAWAY:

CFT procedures were successfully completed in all patients, with a mean procedure time of 21 minutes, and helped identify coronary vasomotor disorders in 78% of patients.

SAQ summary scores improved more in the intervention group than in the standard care group (mean difference, 9.4 units; P = .001), primarily driven by fewer episodes of angina and better quality of life.

Patients in the intervention group experienced greater satisfaction with treatment than those in the standard care group (P = .001).

No CFT-related complications were reported during or immediately after the procedure, and neither group experienced major adverse cardiac events over 6 months of follow-up.

IN PRACTICE:

“Implementing a pragmatic CFT protocol combined with a disease-specific treatment protocol significantly improved disease-related quality of life and angina frequency in patients with ANOCA compared with standard care. These findings support the integration of CFT-guided care into routine clinical practice,” the researchers reported.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Coen K. M. Boerhout of Amsterdam University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online on August 12, 2025, in the European Heart Journal.

LIMITATIONS:

Conducting a fully blinded randomized study was not possible owing to the nature of CFT. Reliance on patient-reported outcomes may have introduced bias. Defining endotypes of ANOCA according to specific cut-offs may not have captured the full spectrum of the condition.

DISCLOSURES:

This trial was funded by a restricted institutional research grant from Philips to Amsterdam University Medical Center. Several authors reported receiving consultancy fees, speaker fees, honoraria, and institutional research grants from various sources, including Philips, British Heart Foundation, and Medical Research Council. One author reported being an employee of the University of Glasgow, which holds financial ties with multiple pharmaceutical and healthcare companies.

US interest rate outlook under scrutiny amid inflation update

The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is updated to hopefully add some clarity to the forward path for US interest rates alongside consumer spending, household confidence and durable goods orders. GDP updates are also provided for the US and Canada, as well as India, France and Italy. PMI data for mainland China will meanwhile be a key focus for APAC alongside tier one economic data for Japan and central bank policy meetings in South Korea and the Philippines.

At the time of writing, the market is pricing in a 70% chance of the FOMC reducing interest rates at its next policy meeting in September. To the increasing frustration of President Donald Trump, the Fed has held rates steady at 4.25-4.50% over the year-to-date so far, but the perception in the market is that the balance of power is shifting to the dovish side among FOMC members. It is likely, however, that the price gauges from the personal consumer expenditure (PCE) release, due on Friday, will need to bring some reassuring news on inflation to persuade the majority of policymakers that such an imminent rate cut is warranted.

To recap, June's PCE data showed a 0.3% rise after a 0.2% gain in May. That took the annual rate of increase from 2.4% to 2.6%, so increasingly above the FOMC's 2% target. Core PCE inflation held at 2.8%. Since then, consumer price inflation (CPI) data brought some relief by holding steady at 2.7% in July, but core CPI inflation accelerated to 3.1% and producer price inflation hit 3.3%, the highest since January.

Survey data have been even less encouraging for the doves. The latest data from S&P Global's flash PMI surveys showed that average prices charged for goods and services rose in the US at the steepest rate for three years in August, building on especially strong rises in the prior three months. The price rises were overwhelmingly blamed on companies passing higher costs linked to tariffs through to customers.

Key to the consumer inflation outlook and Friday's PCE data is therefore whether retailers and other consumer-facing firms will soak up some of these price increases through squeezed margins, or whether we will start to see some greater pass-through of tariff costs on to households. A further question is whether this tariff impact will merely cause a one-off lift in the price level, or lead to more entrenched, stickier inflation. It is likely that the answers to these questions will not be known before the September FOMC meeting, encouraging some scepticism that rates will be cut.

The US also once again reported by far the sharpest rise in prices of the major developed economies, blamed on tariffs, according to August's flash PMI data.

What to watch in the coming week

Americas: US GDP, core PCE, durable goods orders, new home sales, consumer confidence, personal income and spending data; Canada GDP

The US updates second quarter GDP data following an initial print of 3.0%. Additionally, we will also get the core PCE price index data for July. CPI data showed a lower-than-expected headline reading with a steady 2.7% increase, but core CPI rose to the fastest rise since January at 3.1%, and producer price inflation was higher than expected at 3.3%. Indications from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will be crucial for expectations relating to the interest rate path ahead of the September meeting, for which markets are pricing in a strong likelihood of a rate cut. Other key US economic data releases include durable goods orders, new home sales and personal income and spending.

Separately, Canada also releases GDP data for the second quarter. According to PMI data, the worst of the US tariff shock appears to be over in the near term for the Canadian economy, but growth clearly remains subdued.

EMEA: Germany, Italy, France and Spain inflation; Eurozone economic sentiment; Germany Ifo business climate and GfK consumer confidence; Switzerland GDP

Preliminary August inflation data from Germany, Italy, France and Spain will be released at the end of the week. This comes after the latest HCOB Flash Eurozone PMI continued to suggest muted inflation in the months ahead.

Additionally, economic sentiment data from Germany and the eurozone will also be released during the week with early flash PMI data showing a slight cooling of business optimism among German companies, but with further signs of manufacturing starting to recover from its post-pandemic decline.

APAC: BoK, BSP meetings, RBA meeting minutes; China NBS PMI data; India GDP; Australia CPI, Japan consumer confidence, industrial production and unemployment data

A busy economic data calendar is expected in the new week for APAC, in addition to central bank meetings in South Korea and the Philippines. PMI data from mainland China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) will be due over the weekend. Meanwhile, GDP for the April to June period will be released for India.

Other key releases in the week include monthly CPI data from Australia and Japan's consumer confidence and industrial production numbers. The latest S&P Global Flash Japan PMI revealed that manufacturing output returned to growth in August, albeit only marginally, after contracting in July.

McDonald's has also realized that and now says they're lowering prices to drive more traffic to the company.

Combo prices will eventually end up being 15% less than the total cost of buying each combo item separately, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The change up comes as McDonald's has been adding to their menu after two consecutive quarters of sinking sales, according to CNN. That trend was broken by reintroducing the Snack Wrap to the menu, introducing spicy chicken and chicken tenders, and marketing for the Minecraft movie, the live-action video game movie starring Jack Black which grossed almost $1 billion worldwide.

Value items and combos have also made a resurgence at the chain with the $2.99 price of a Snack Wrap running through the rest of the year, the $5 meal deal and their buy one, add one for $1 deal on certain menu items.

Prices vary by location, resulting in the company coming under fire online for having an $18 Big Mac meal last year.

CEO Chris Kempczinski previously said low- and middle-income customers weren't spending at McDonald's due to high prices and general inflation. It prompted the company to freshen up the menu with new items, value deals and promotions.

He also said consumers are often seeing combo meals costing more than $10, which is ""shaping value perceptions in a negative way,"" and they ""got to get that fixed.""

This includes one tranche covered by Swedish export credit agency EKN and a commercial tranche secured by the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC).

Alongside seven international banks, KfW IPEX-Bank is acting as Mandated Lead Arranger. Société Générale is coordinating the financing totalling almost EUR 1.55 billion.

“With this transaction, we not only underline our expertise in financing sustainable rail infrastructure and export finance, but also support efforts to strengthen the region’s resilience to major earthquakes,” said Aida Welker, member of the management board of KfW IPEX-Bank.

The 25-km Hassa-Dörtyol rail and road tunnel will connect the cities of Dörtyol and Hassa in Hatay province. It is of high strategic value, providing a direct link between industrial hubs in southeastern Anatolia and the key port of Iskenderun on the eastern Mediterranean.

This will significantly reduce transport times for freight and passengers, while also cutting CO₂ emissions by avoiding a major detour around the Nur Mountains. The tunnel will further benefit the regions severely affected by the 2023 earthquake by establishing earthquake-resistant road and rail infrastructure. A significant portion of the construction materials and equipment will be supplied by European companies.

The project is being carried out by a joint venture of EPC contractors Doğuş İnşaat ve Ticaret and Eze İnşaat. The project is owned by AYGM, the General Directorate of Infrastructure Investments at the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure of the Republic of Turkey, while the Republic of Turkey’s Ministry of Finance is acting as the borrower.

Yakult Danone India, established in 2005 and present in the market since 2008, is expanding its presence to nearly 700 cities nationwide.

The company has also outlined a long-term plan to maintain double-digit annual growth in the country until 2030.

Yakult Danone India, established in 2005 and present in the market since 2008, is expanding its presence to nearly 700 cities nationwide. The company is also seeking to broaden its consumer base beyond the upper and mid middle classes by pushing further into the mass segment.

“The growth (expectation in India) is double-digit growth for this year and the next year also,” said Yakult Danone India Managing Director Eiji Amano.

He added, “Our next milestone of achieving double-digit growth every year until 2030 reflects the growing demand for probiotics and the confidence we have in the Indian market.”

Amano said India has significant potential, supported by the expansion of the middle class and rising health awareness. “It is big,” he said when asked about the opportunity in the country.

While India is still relatively young for Yakult compared with markets such as Japan, Indonesia, and China where the brand has been present for decades, the company is working to scale up volumes.

“We are only 17 years old in India. So now it’s in the process to reach there (the scale of other countries), but still the potential is very big in India... We are present in 40 countries in the world. Among the 40 countries, India is ranked in the middle,” he noted.

On India’s long-term potential, Amano said, “We hope so but other countries are also growing, but it can as it has a huge potential,” when asked whether India could break into Yakult’s top ten markets globally. The company’s four largest markets currently are Japan, China, Indonesia and Mexico.

Bollywood actor Pannu, speaking on her association with Yakult, said, “I’m really happy to be part of Yakult’s journey in promoting good gut health. My family has been enjoying Yakult for years, especially my mom, and I’ve seen first-hand how small, consistent habits can make a big difference. I truly believe that good health starts in the gut, and Yakult is such an easy, tasty way to include that in our daily routine. I’m excited to help spread this message and encourage more people across India to embrace a healthier lifestyle.”

Yakult’s India portfolio currently includes its flagship probiotic drink, containing over 6.5 billion Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota bacteria per serving, and a reduced sugar variant, Yakult Light, launched in 2018. New flavours such as mango and less sugar versions have been introduced in recent years.

The company has also relied on its “Yakult Ladies” initiative, a home delivery model run by specially trained women who distribute the drink directly to households while educating families about gut health. This model has been described by the company as both a last-mile distribution mechanism and a platform for women’s economic empowerment.

According to IMARC Group estimates, India’s probiotic drinks market was valued at INR 1,348.8 million in 2024 and is projected to expand to nearly INR 5,778.9 million by 2033 at a compound annual growth rate of 16.67%.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/bmi/media/media_files/2025/08/22/yakult-2025-08-22-10-09-20.png,N,,2025-08-22 02:01:51.293529

It now covers 1lb and 2lb bags of shrimp sold between July 17 and August 8 under the brand names Sand Bar, Best Yet, Arctic Shores, Great American Seafood Imports and First Street.
Anyone who believes they have eaten the radioactive shrimp has been advised to consult with their doctor.
Anyone who has consumed the radioactive shrimp could be at higher risk of DNA damage and cancer, such as thyroid cancer.
The radioactive shrimp bags in the latest recall were sold in nine states: Alabama, Louisiana, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington state.","An urgent recall of radioactive frozen shrimp that may be contaminated with nuclear waste has been widened to Kroger, Instacart and another four states.

It now covers 1lb and 2lb bags of shrimp sold between July 17 and August 8 under the brand names Sand Bar, Best Yet, Arctic Shores, Great American Seafood Imports and First Street.

The 13 products in the recall were on shelves in nine states across the South, West, MidWest and NorthEast.

It takes the total number of states affected in the recall to 19, after Great Value frozen shrimp products sold by Walmart were also recalled on Tuesday amid concerns over contamination.

All the products in the recall were sent to the US by BMS Foods in Indonesia, with FDA officials saying that contamination likely occurred during the packaging and preparation process.

Tests have revealed that the shrimp may be contaminated with high levels of Cesium-137, a byproduct of nuclear waste and nuclear weapons tests.

Cesium-137 is present at very low levels in the environment, partially as a result of nuclear tests, and is generally harmless.

But once inside the body, the substance can become lodged in tissue and release low-level radiation over time that can damage DNA and cause cells to turn cancerous.

Your browser does not support iframes.

Shoppers are being urged to throw out shrimp that are in the recall immediately and return to stores to secure a full refund.

The FDA has not revealed what to do if someone has consumed the shrimps, but customers can generally contact the agency for advice via its online reporting form.

Anyone who believes they have eaten the radioactive shrimp has been advised to consult with their doctor.

No illnesses have been reported linked to the recall to date.

Anyone who has consumed the radioactive shrimp could be at higher risk of DNA damage and cancer, such as thyroid cancer.

The FDA said: 'The primary health effect of concern [with Cesium-137 following longer term, repeated low dose exposure (e.g. through consumption of contaminated food or water over time) is an elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.'

Shoppers can check whether their product is in the recall by checking the LOT number, which is listed on the back of the package underneath the barcode.

The FDA has published a full list of the codes for the products on its website. It is not clear exactly how many bags of shrimp have been recalled.

The radioactive shrimp bags in the latest recall were sold in nine states: Alabama, Louisiana, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington state.

In the first recall, the Great Value shrimp sold in Walmart were sold in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.

Southwind Foods, based in California, shipped the shrimp across the US and issued the recall. Online, the business says it supplies the 'finest fresh and frozen responsibly harvested seafood'.

The FDA was alerted to the potential contamination by the Customs and Border Protection agency, which detected Cesium-137 in shipping containers at four major US ports.

Tests on these shrimp revealed they had a radiation level of 68 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg).

This is significantly below the safe level of under 1,200 Bq/kg, but has still concerned officials who fear that it could cause harm to consumers.

Shrimp can absorb Cesium-137 from their environment if their habitat is contaminated with the substance, but can also become contaminated if they are washed with water that contains the radioactive substance.

There are no nuclear power plants in Indonesia, where the shrimp were prepared, and the country does not possess or test any nuclear weapons.

The Southern Shrimp Alliance, a Florida-based organization of shrimp sellers, suggested online that the contamination might be linked to the Fukushima nuclear plant fuel leak in 2011, with investigators saying at the time that the fuel released into the environment would be radioactive for at least 30 years.

The lobby group also said the FDA had rejected a large number of shrimp shipments from Indonesia this year for multiple violations including the use of banned pesticides.

Cesium-137 is primarily released by nuclear power plants or weapons, but it can also be used in industry to detect the flow of liquid through pipes, and by hospitals for medical sterilization and radiation therapy for treating cancer.

The recall is believed to be the first ever in the US linked to detection of Cesium-137 in commercial food products.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/21/22/101443911-0-image-m-3_1755811792355.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:12:36.339221

As central banks pivot toward rate normalization, BKIE's focus on developed markets—regions with strong fiscal frameworks and innovation-driven economies—offers a compelling narrative for those seeking to navigate the next phase of the economic cycle.
Incorporating BKIE into a diversified portfolio is not merely a tactical move but a forward-looking strategy to harness the resilience of global markets in an era of uncertainty.","As global economies navigate the tail end of pandemic-driven disruptions and central banks signal a shift toward rate stabilization, investors are increasingly seeking strategies that balance capital preservation with growth potential. In this evolving landscape, the BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (BKIE) emerges as a compelling vehicle for accessing developed markets outside the U.S., offering a low-cost, transparent, and liquid solution to diversify equity portfolios.

Index Alignment: A Blueprint for Global Exposure

BKIE tracks the Solactive GBS Developed Markets ex United States Large & Mid Cap Index NTR, a benchmark designed to capture the largest 85% of the free-float market capitalization in developed markets excluding the U.S. This index spans 23 countries, including economic powerhouses like Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and is weighted by market cap to reflect regional economic significance. By focusing on large and mid-cap stocks, BKIE avoids overconcentration in any single sector or geography while maintaining exposure to global leaders such as ASML Holding NV (1.30% of the portfolio) and AstraZeneca PLC.

The index's construction ensures investors benefit from the resilience of multinational corporations that thrive in a post-pandemic world. For instance, companies in healthcare, technology, and industrials—sectors with strong long-term growth trajectories—are well-represented. This alignment not only mitigates regional risks but also positions the ETF to capitalize on structural trends like AI adoption and green energy transitions.

Liquidity and Cost Efficiency: The Passive Investor's Edge

With a 0.04% expense ratio, BKIE ranks among the most cost-effective options for international equity exposure. Its passive strategy, evidenced by a 6.59% trailing turnover ratio, minimizes transaction costs and aligns with long-term capital preservation goals. Liquidity metrics further reinforce its appeal: a 20-day average trading volume of 33,232 shares and a median bid-ask spread of 0.18% suggest that investors can enter or exit positions with minimal slippage. These characteristics are critical in a rate-stabilizing environment, where volatility may persist as markets recalibrate to shifting monetary policy.

Morningstar 4-Star Rating: A Vote of Confidence

BKIE's 4-star rating from Morningstar (as of July 31, 2025) underscores its strong performance relative to peers in the Foreign Large Blend category. This rating reflects the fund's ability to deliver competitive returns while maintaining a diversified, low-cost structure. Portfolio managers at Mellon Investments Corporation, including David France and Todd Frysinger, have leveraged their expertise to ensure the ETF remains tightly aligned with its benchmark, avoiding active deviations that could erode returns.

Strategic Value in a Diversified Portfolio

In a world where U.S. equities have dominated for years, BKIE offers a counterbalance by tapping into the growth potential of developed markets. These regions, with their mature economies and stable regulatory environments, provide a hedge against U.S.-centric risks such as inflationary pressures or sector-specific downturns. For instance, European and Japanese companies often exhibit different earnings cycles and currency dynamics, which can smooth portfolio volatility.

Moreover, BKIE's $961.6 million in net assets (as of August 18, 2025) indicates growing institutional and retail confidence, a trend likely to continue as investors seek alternatives to overvalued domestic stocks. The ETF's quarterly dividend distribution also adds an income component, enhancing its appeal in a low-yield environment.

Conclusion: A Prudent Bet for the Long Term

For investors prioritizing diversification, cost efficiency, and liquidity, BKIE represents a strategic addition to a global recovery play. Its alignment with a broad, market-cap-weighted index, coupled with a Morningstar 4-star rating and favorable liquidity metrics, positions it as a robust tool for capital preservation and growth. As central banks pivot toward rate normalization, BKIE's focus on developed markets—regions with strong fiscal frameworks and innovation-driven economies—offers a compelling narrative for those seeking to navigate the next phase of the economic cycle.

Just one week prior to the event, Power Maxed Racing looked like they would be out of the championship, following an inferno at the team’s headquarters which destroyed not only its equipment but also the team’s Vauxhall Astra cars with which it has raced since 2017.

However, the team rallied around and received unprecedented support from within the paddock, resulting in its remarkable continued participation in the championship.

The team was able to borrow two CUPRA Leons for the trip to Scotland – one from Dexter Patterson’s father and the other from rival squad Un-Limited Motorsport.

With the cars prepared at rapid pace in the run up to the weekend, it was a step into the unknown for Doble on Friday, when he and team-mate Nick Halstead were allowed to completed a handful of shakedown laps.

The 26-year-old then qualified in a commendable 15th on Saturday afternoon, just missing out on progressing into Q2.

Doble struggled to stay in the points in the opening race, however, battling to a 17th-place finish on his first start in the CUPRA, electing to get the harder medium-compound tyre out of the way early on.

He slipped to 18th for the second race, before recording a points finish in 15th in the final race. Crucially, Doble finished all three races fourth overall in the Independents category, limiting the damage to his title challenge, although he lost the lead of the category to Chris Smiley, who he now trails by 13 points.

Doble admitted that he had hoped for more from his weekend, but was full of praise for the work put in by his team and the support received from the wider motorsport community to help him be on the grid at all.

“I think it’s fair to say it’s not just been a rollercoaster weekend, but a rollercoaster week,” said Doble. “Just over seven days ago it was unclear whether we’d race again this season so to have now completed all three races at Knockhill is quite an achievement.

“I’ve got to say a massive thank you to every single member of the Power Maxed Racing team because what has been achieved over these last few days is nothing short of incredible.

“They moved heaven and earth to be here and put in some long hours to ensure we were competitive.

“Obviously being in Scotland was a win in itself but I would be lying if I didn’t say I hoped to come away with a little more from the weekend.

“That being said there were no real expectations as this was the first-ever time driving the Cupra.

“Every session was a step into the unknown, but we learnt a huge amount about the car.

“We’ve got a long way to go but we’ve got an idea of what direction we want to take the Cupra heading into the next round – so hopefully we will see more progress at Donington Park.”",https://www.touringcars.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mikey-Doble-PMR-CUPRA.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 06:03:27.555452

By Crystal Hsu / Staff reporter

The New Taiwan dollar yesterday fell for a sixth day to its weakest level in three months, driven by equity-related outflows and reactions to an economics official’s exchange rate remarks.

The NT dollar slid NT$0.197, or 0.65 percent, to close at NT$30.505 per US dollar, central bank data showed.

The local currency has depreciated 1.97 percent so far this month, ranking as the weakest performer among Asian currencies.

Dealers attributed the retreat to foreign investors wiring capital gains and dividends abroad after taking profit in local shares.

They also pointed to reports that Washington might consider taking equity stakes in chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電), that receive US CHIPS and Science Act funding.

The central bank on Wednesday rejected media reports suggesting that the NT dollar had appreciated 10 percentage points more than the yen and won against the greenback this year, stating that the local currency’s movements have remained relatively stable.

The central bank said that exchange rates are mainly determined by market supply and demand, with intervention limited to cases of excessive volatility or abnormal capital flows.

Compared with other Asian currencies, the NT dollar has shown relatively modest swings over the long term, it said.

With Taiwan heavily reliant on exports, particularly in semiconductors and other high-tech goods, exchange rate stability remains a key policy concern. A stronger NT dollar helps reduce import costs and inflation, but undermines exporters’ competitiveness — a balance the central bank seeks to maintain.

The clarification followed Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo’s (郭智輝) remarks to lawmakers earlier on Wednesday that industry groups would prefer to see a more stable exchange rate closer to the six-year average of NT$31 per US dollar for the rest of the year.

Local manufacturers have expressed concern about eroding competitiveness after Washington imposed a 20 percent tariff on Taiwanese goods, on top of existing levies, Kuo said.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/08/22/P09-250822-605.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 07:05:43.964195

Bajaj, which bought out KTM, wants the brand to focus on motorcycles, so it's sold KTM Sportcar GmbH to a separate group of investors, hopefully saving the X-Bow sports car. KTM will continue to license its name and be involved with the X-Bow in some way, but KTM Sportcar GmbH will run independently of the main company. The X-Bow was always a strange duck in KTM's lineup, so this makes a great deal of sense.

KTM confirmed to Austria's Industrie Magazin that the De Mevius family, better known for the beer mega-conglomerate AB InBev, is heading up negotiations, along with other anonymous investors. ""AB"" stands for Anheuser-Busch, which is just one of more than 500 brands the company owns that make it the largest brewer in the world. This may seem like an unlikely pairing, but the De Mevius family is actively involved in motorsports. Gregoire De Mevius is a long-time rally and Dakar competitor who still enters the occasional rally today. His sons, Guillaume and Ghislain, continue racing in his dusty footsteps.

While the X-Bow has evolved over the years, it's difficult for a car company to survive with only one model in the lineup (just ask Saturn). The new owners plan to address that by adding new models, or at least variants, to give buyers a bit more selection. This will include not only the current track-focused models, but also street-legal supersports, which seems a natural expansion. Cars like the Radical SR3 have already gone there. While not a great grocery getter, you could at least drive it to the track, where you could enjoy its full capabilities without going directly to jail afterward.

The new ownership also intends to expand the X-Bow range in a less intuitive direction with off-road offerings. This may seem weird for a track car, but given the De Mevius family's rally and Dakar history, I wouldn't be surprised if that's where they're going with this. Imagine X-Bow given the Rally Fighter treatment, attacking rally stages or jumping desert dunes. Perhaps different versions would be available for each discipline, similar to KTM's different motorcycle offerings for motocross, enduro, and cross country based on the same platforms. We're just speculating, as no details are yet available, but it would be great to see KTM tackling the stages on four wheels as well as two. Regardless, it seems that, like the man on the cart in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" the X-Bow isn't quite dead yet.

Starbucks and Car Toys closed their doors at the shopping center at Sixth Avenue and Broadway on Wednesday.

“Starbucks is closing all non drive-thrus, it wasn’t anything specific about the space they didn’t like,” said JLL broker Jeff Feldman.

Feldman and colleague Sam Zaitz are marketing Starbuck’s 1,700 square feet at 575 Lincoln St. for lease. He noted the location’s visibility, proximity to other neighborhoods and heavy traffic around the area.

What will happen to Car Toys, however, is more of an open question.

On August 21, 2025, at 09:45, U.S. Bancorp's (NYSE: USB) 15-minute chart triggered a MACD Death Cross and a KDJ Death Cross, signaling a potential shift in the stock's momentum towards the downside. These technical indicators suggest that the stock price may continue to fall, raising concerns for investors.

The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock's price. A Death Cross occurs when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, indicating a potential bearish trend. Similarly, the KDJ (K moving average, D moving average, J oscillator) is a momentum indicator that helps identify overbought or oversold conditions. A KDJ Death Cross occurs when the K line crosses below the D line, suggesting a potential decline in the stock's price.

U.S. Bancorp reported $1.11 earnings per share for the last quarter, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.07, with a revenue of $7.06 billion [1]. Despite the strong earnings, the recent MACD and KDJ Death Crosses indicate a potential change in investor sentiment, which could lead to a decrease in the stock's value.

Several hedge funds have recently modified their holdings in U.S. Bancorp. Aberdeen Group plc lifted its stake by 105.5% in the first quarter, while other funds like Westend Capital Management LLC, YANKCOM Partnership, Alpine Bank Wealth Management, REAP Financial Group LLC, and Cornerstone Planning Group LLC also increased their stakes [1]. However, the recent technical indicators suggest that the stock may face downward pressure, despite the increased institutional ownership.

The stock's performance has been volatile, with a 1-year low of $35.18 and a 1-year high of $53.98. The current market capitalization is $71.52 billion, with a PE ratio of 11.00 and a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of 1.47. The stock's 50-day moving average is $45.46, and its 200-day moving average is $43.86 [1].

Investors should monitor the stock closely as the MACD and KDJ Death Crosses suggest a potential downward trend. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as earnings reports and market conditions, when making investment decisions.

North Korea has built a “secret” military base near its border with China, which might house Pyongyang’s newest long-range ballistic missiles, new research showed.

The “undeclared” Sinpung-dong Missile Operating Base lies about 27km from the Chinese frontier, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a report published on Wednesday.

The facility likely houses six to nine nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles and their launchers, the study said, adding that the weapons “pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States.”

North Korea has ramped up its nuclear weapons program since a failed summit with the US in 2019, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un recently called for the “rapid expansion” of the nation’s nuclear capabilities.

The base is one of about “15 to 20 ballistic missile bases, maintenance, support, missile storage and warhead storage facilities which North Korea has never declared,” the report said.

The facility is “not known to have been the subject of any denuclearization negotiations previously conducted between the United States and North Korea,” it added.

The launchers and missiles could leave the base in times of crisis or war, link up with special units and conduct harder-to-detect launches from other parts of the country, the CSIS said.

The base, along with others, “represent the primary components of what is presumed to be North Korea’s evolving ballistic missile strategy, and its expanding strategic-level nuclear deterrence and strike capabilities,” the report said.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/08/22/P01-250822-313.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 00:03:13.057348

In a significant move, JPMorgan has downgraded General Mills to Underweight from Neutral, setting a new price target of $45. The financial services giant cited slower growth in the center store category and market share losses as key reasons for the downgrade [1].

The downgrade comes as JPMorgan assumes coverage of 24 stocks across the food producers, food retail, and agricultural products sectors. The firm has highlighted McCormick, Albertsons, Hormel Foods, and J.M. Smucker as top picks, while expressing caution on Beyond Meat and General Mills [1].

General Mills has been facing challenges in its core business, with slower growth in the center store category and declining market share. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 for the last quarter, slightly exceeding analyst expectations, but revenue fell 3.3% year-over-year to $4.56 billion [3].

The company's stock has seen increased institutional ownership, with 75.71% of shares held by hedge funds and other institutional investors. Ethic Inc., for instance, increased its holdings in General Mills by 5.0% to 117,289 shares valued at approximately $7 million [3].

Despite the downgrade, General Mills remains a dividend-paying stock, with a recent quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share, representing a $2.44 annualized dividend and a 4.9% dividend yield [3]. The company's payout ratio is currently 59.51%, indicating a healthy balance between dividends and earnings.

“Monthly receipts data reliably shows how fiscal drag is bringing more wealth into the scope of IHT, but the numbers that really matter for wealthier households are those showing the overall state of the public finances, because that’s what prompted last year’s Budget overhaul of IHT rules, and it’s not unthinkable that the transfer of wealth will be on the table again at the next Budget.

Dyall highlighted that the dilution of business and agricultural property reliefs doesn’t come into force until next April, and the inclusion of unspent pension assets in estates doesn’t occur until April 2027, so we won’t see how much money they bring in through the Treasury door until well after those dates.

Powered by OIKOS’ Advanced FUSION Blend, the FUSION drink is designed to help build and retain muscle mass during weight loss when combined with exercise and a balanced diet.
Together, this trifecta blend takes muscle support to the next level by helping consumers trigger muscle synthesis when paired with a balanced diet and exercise.
bottle format for OIKOS’ FUSION drink was chosen so that each consumer can enjoy — and comfortably finish consuming — a nutrient-dense drink.
OIKOS’ FUSION drink will launch in the refrigerated section of select retailers this month, with additional retailers rolling out this fall.","The demand for nutrient-dense food and beverage options continues to rise as consumers prioritize health-conscious choices. In fact, one in four people in the U.S. (27%) report being on a weight loss journey, and nearly 10% of the U.S. population has used a GLP-1 medication. For many, this creates nutrition challenges — including meeting daily protein needs to help prevent muscle loss. Research suggests that muscle mass accounts for approximately 20% of weight lost while on a GLP-1 medication. OIKOS is stepping up to the challenge to support consumer needs and goals by introducing FUSION, a nutrient-dense cultured dairy drink developed to support muscle mass during weight loss while also supporting digestive health.

Powered by OIKOS’ Advanced FUSION Blend, the FUSION drink is designed to help build and retain muscle mass during weight loss when combined with exercise and a balanced diet. It was created and positioned to support the nutrition needs of GLP-1 users and other weight loss consumers, with a combination of whey protein, leucine and vitamin D. These three nutrients have been researched in populations at risk for muscle loss, including two clinical trials conducted by Danone, OIKOS’ parent company. Together, this trifecta blend takes muscle support to the next level by helping consumers trigger muscle synthesis when paired with a balanced diet and exercise.

“Pairing Danone’s decades of science expertise with the OIKOS brand’s emphasis on strength and high-quality protein enabled us to create something truly unique for people looking to maintain muscle mass while on a weight loss journey,” says Rafael Acevedo, president of yogurt at Danone North America. “The growing need for tailored nutrition solutions for people experiencing muscle mass loss is something we can expertly tackle. We know change takes strength, and we believe weight loss isn’t only about taking things away — it’s about adding and strengthening routines with nutrient-dense products that help people better meet their goals.”

OIKOS’ FUSION drink comes in three flavors, including Strawberry, Mixed Berry and Vanilla. Each nutrient-dense, 7-fl.-oz., 130-calorie bottle is lactose-free and a good source of calcium and vitamins A and D. It contains OIKOS’ Advanced FUSION Blend of whey protein, leucine and vitamin D; 23 g of complete protein to support strong muscles; 5 g of prebiotic fiber to support digestive health; 0 g of added sugar; no artificial sweeteners, synthetic colors or dyes; and vitamins B3 and B12 to help convert food to energy.

“People on a weight loss journey often eat less, so it’s crucial to focus on the nutrient density of the foods they do eat,” explains Whitney Evans, director of nutrition and scientific affairs at Danone North America. “When protein needs are not met, the body will start breaking down muscle to get the amino acids it needs. Fiber is also important, considering its role in digestive health and because most American fall short on fiber intake. That’s why we created OIKOS FUSION — in listening to GLP-1 users and studying the latest research, we packed as much targeted nutrition as possible into a small, delicious and convenient bottle to help make it easier to meet key nutrition needs.”

Based on insights from those on GLP-1 medications, delivering nutrition in a compact size was top-of-mind for OIKOS. The 7-fl.-oz. bottle format for OIKOS’ FUSION drink was chosen so that each consumer can enjoy — and comfortably finish consuming — a nutrient-dense drink.

Danone also created a dedicated nutrition hub for GLP-1 users to deliver clear, credible guidance on the nutritional needs of GLP-1 medication users, featuring expert advice and product recommendations from across its yogurt and waters portfolio.

OIKOS’ FUSION drink will launch in the refrigerated section of select retailers this month, with additional retailers rolling out this fall.

OIKOS’ FUSION drink is the latest addition to its range of high-protein offerings, from yogurt cups and protein shots to the new Protein Shakes, which were launched in May as a shelf-stable way to get protein on the go. These launches underscore OIKOS’ commitment to delivering protein-forward options for everyone, at every stage of their health and fitness journey.",https://www.foodengineeringmag.com/ext/resources/2025/08/21/OIKOS-FUSION-Cultured-Dairy-Drink-1170-Centered.jpg?height=635&t=1755819177&width=1200,N,,2025-08-21 23:04:03.099934

Despite its low valuation, Elevance carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), underscoring challenges in navigating rising medical costs and regulatory scrutiny.","Elevance Health (ELV) traded with a 0.13% decline on August 21, 2025, with a trading volume of $500 million, a 25.72% drop from the previous day, ranking 171st in market activity. The stock’s underperformance was driven by a legal setback that threatens to cost the insurer $375 million in 2025 Medicare Advantage bonus payments. A federal judge dismissed Elevance’s challenge to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) rating methodology, upholding the agency’s authority to set standards. The ruling means one of Elevance’s contracts, calculated at 3.749565 stars, was rounded down to 3.5, falling short of the four-star threshold required for bonus eligibility. The case, which Elevance argued was “arbitrary and capricious,” highlights regulatory risks in the Medicare Advantage sector, where CMS star ratings directly impact both federal incentives and consumer enrollment decisions.

The decision sets a precedent that could deter insurers from contesting CMS methodologies in court, shifting focus toward operational improvements and member satisfaction. Elevance’s valuation reflects these pressures, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 9.72, well below the industry average of 15.25. Analysts’ consensus estimate for 2025 earnings stands at $30.15 per share, signaling an 8.8% decline year-over-year. Despite its low valuation, Elevance carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), underscoring challenges in navigating rising medical costs and regulatory scrutiny. The stock’s year-to-date loss of 16.1% contrasts with the industry’s modest 0.2% growth, reflecting broader sector struggles.

Ten organizations have been designated as qualified health information networks, or QHINs, increasing from just five at TEFCA’s launch.
And healthcare data can be complicated: What if clinical data from your doctor and your insurer don’t clearly match up?
“It’s really hard for most people to digest and consume really complex healthcare data,” Mosier said.
Some apps tasked with giving patients control over their health data might operate outside the HIPAA privacy and security law, Nisenbaum said.","The Trump administration’s initiative to boost health data sharing could be a boon for interoperability, but the plan so far lacks detail — and challenges like data security, under-resourced providers and slow technology uptake could be barriers to success, experts say.

The initiative, announced late last month at the White House by leaders of the HHS and CMS, aims to improve long-standing challenges with health data exchange through partnerships with more than 60 companies, including firms like Amazon, Google, Epic and UnitedHealth.

The plan includes two large focus areas: encouraging adoption of a voluntary blueprint for data sharing called the CMS Interoperability Framework and increasing the availability of digital health tools, like products for chronic disease management and care navigation.

The companies pledged to “deliver results for the American people” in the first quarter next year, the CMS said.

But that’s a quick turnaround — and though the initiative has set out criteria on how the interoperability framework should work, it isn’t clear yet how the plan will function, experts say.

“It appears to me that most of the work is dependent on these 60 companies who’ve signed up, but I’m not actually sure how this is all going to get done,” said Beth Mosier, a director on consultancy West Monroe’s healthcare M&A team. “It seems to be, you volunteer and you figure it out. So I think there’s a lot left to be defined on how this is actually going to work.”

Improved data sharing can’t hurt

Still, the initiative has a worthy goal, given the healthcare sector’s challenges with data sharing, experts say.

Interoperability and information sharing is a long-term problem for the industry, made harder by siloed data that doesn’t easily flow between providers and a reliance on dated technology like fax machines.

Many patients likely go to multiple providers who utilize separate patient portals, so consumers are piecing together their health data from several different places, Mosier said. Giving patients easier access to all their information could be empowering, allowing them to make data-driven decisions about their healthcare, she added.

The plan likely won’t hurt interoperability, and getting the CMS involved — the nation’s largest payer that processes more than one billion Medicare claims annually — could facilitate data sharing and accessibility, said Alex Nisenbaum, partner at law firm Blank Rome.

Plus, the ease of data flow is more important now than ever, as the sector tries to shift more care into value-based payment arrangements and adopt artificial intelligence tools, said Jennifer Goldsack, CEO of the Digital Medicine Society.

AI needs to be trained on vast troves of data to function. Meanwhile, providers need access to data to adequately predict risk in value-based care arrangements.

It’s likely less risky for the companies involved to work together with the CMS and the other pledged firms than to try and figure things out on their own, Goldsack said. Plus, the initiative, and the names of the companies who decided to sign on, have been very visible, which might incentivize them to commit to the project.

“If someone down the line then wants to take their toys and leave the sandbox, it’s not a good look,” Goldsack said. “And so I would imagine that there’s some commercial pressure to stay the course and deliver.”

A high bar for patient access

The “million dollar question” is how the initiative will work in practice, Nisenbaum said.

One possibility is the data sharing pledge could build upon and enhance the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, a governance framework for health data exchange that went live at the end of 2023, he said.

TEFCA has built up momentum in recent years. Ten organizations have been designated as qualified health information networks, or QHINs, increasing from just five at TEFCA’s launch.

Several QHINs, including CommonWell Health Alliance, eClinicalWorks, eHealth Exchange and Health Gorilla, have pledged to implement the interoperability framework and become CMS Aligned Networks.

However, the new initiative places an emphasis on putting data at patients’ fingertips, while TEFCA focused more on sharing among healthcare organizations to improve care coordination, Nisenbaum said.

The expectations for patient data access are pretty high, Mosier said. Some of the criteria under the CMS’ framework include ensuring patients can access their electronic medical information through apps of their choice, as well as find their claims, explanations of benefits, prior authorizations and clinical data from current and past payers.

“BYOD or bring your own device is basically what they’re talking about, and that has not been solved almost anywhere elegantly in healthcare, right?” Mosier said. “Patient portals and provider portals exist for a reason. [...] To support every device anyone may bring is a big commitment.”

Typically, when BYOD is implemented successfully, it uses a pretty basic interface, she said. And healthcare data can be complicated: What if clinical data from your doctor and your insurer don’t clearly match up? What if that information is confusing?

Even if the data is structured and complete, it can be hard to understand. For example, lab results can be confusing without a clinician at hand to explain what the tests mean.

“It’s really hard for most people to digest and consume really complex healthcare data,” Mosier said. “I think it will create another level of support that will be needed for these healthcare consumers.”

Data security, technology barriers

Additionally, there are plenty of challenges to overcome in health data sharing, including reticence from providers about adopting new technology and concerns about data privacy, experts say.

Read More in Health IT

The Trump administration wants networks to facilitate access to data using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard, or FHIR, a set of rules that defines how health data can be exchanged between computer systems regardless of how the information is stored.

However, adopting FHIR can be challenging, Mosier said. Providers might implement the standard differently, and they could use different versions of FHIR — potentially complicating exchange as versions change over time.

Data security is another concern. Some apps tasked with giving patients control over their health data might operate outside the HIPAA privacy and security law, Nisenbaum said.

“I think that is going to put the onus on patients to really understand the commitments that these companies are making with respect to collection, use and disclosure of health information,” he said.

That could prove challenging for patients. A 2022 survey from the American Medical Association found just 20% of respondents indicated they knew the scope of companies and individuals with access to their health data.

Plus, companies will have to shoulder a burden of their own when managing a complex and fragmented landscape of data privacy laws. Many states have their own data laws, and some have health-specific requirements, like California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act.

The initiative could spur more states to ink their own privacy legislation, as it only takes a few players using data for suspect purposes, like advertising, to draw regulatory scrutiny, Nisenbaum said.

“The majority of states don’t have these comprehensive privacy laws, right?” he said. “So, still room for regulation, assuming the federal government doesn’t pass something, which it has not been successful at for many years.”

Will under-resourced providers have a seat at the table?

Several health systems and providers have signed onto the pledge, including Cleveland Clinic, Intermountain Health and Providence, promising to participate in a CMS Aligned Network and accept patient data electronically.

However, the number of participating providers is small compared with the amount of health systems operating in the U.S.

And several of the entrants are fairly large providers — which isn’t surprising, given that smaller physician practices are often “pulled along” when it comes to technology adoption, Nisenbaum said.

Managing technical change at healthcare organizations can be challenging, and small practices often look to their vendors to meet data sharing requirements, he added.

And the experiences of large institutions likely won’t match health systems with fewer resources, like rural providers or financially struggling facilities. These health systems usually don’t have the bandwidth to participate in a working group, leaving the particular challenges they face by the wayside, Goldsack said.

“Rural hospitals don’t have a chief innovation officer or a chief digital officer or a chief AI officer or a chief technology officer,” she said. “It’s the CEO doing it off their desk on a Thursday evening, and their tech budget is very small.”

Next steps

For now, the initiative has been clear about its goals, and has brought together a large group of organizations that have signed onto the pledge, Goldsack said.

One indicator of the plan’s progress could center around how the companies involved are integrating the initiative into their development plans, Mosier said.

“If we are hearing Amazon and UnitedHealth talk about this on a consistent basis and what they’re doing, then that’ll lead us in one direction,” she said. “And if this comes out as this big thing, and we don’t hear much about it three and five months later, that’s going to tell something else.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/2CE3Qg2eIS0RrsWlJmVWUbB98kZjzPGLZ5tGgJZqAHk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI3NzY4OTQ2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-21 21:06:19.759463

Nutrition Secure Indy, launching next month, is a pilot program that will provide 250 local families with weekly boxes of fresh produce and protein, alongside a range of resources aimed at addressing the root causes of food insecurity.

That includes cooking and nutrition classes, gardening programs, financial planning workshops and help enrolling in SNAP and WIC.

Led by Elanco Animal Health in partnership with Purdue University, IU Health, Elevance Health, Gleaners Food Bank, Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, Edison School of the Arts, and other local organizations, the program is focused on creating lasting impact for families on Indianapolis’ west side.

“It’s a neighborhood and community in need, as 84% of the kids at Edison are on free or reduced lunch programs,” said Leah Thomas with Elanco. “We believe giving 250 families access to supplemental groceries for a year can change lives.”

The Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, one of the hubs for the initiative, is already seeing overwhelming demand.

“Our refrigerator is empty, cabinets are empty,” said Denise Bailey, a local resident who visits the center. “They give nutritious stuff out.""

Bailey, who lost access to food stamps, said programs like this one make a real difference.

“When you’re used to having them and eating right and then you get cut off and go a month without it, it hurts,” she said. “I just thank God every day.”

The program will also build long-term support systems through community engagement and education. Organizers hope to see outcomes not just in better physical health, but also in school performance and family stability.

“It will run for a year, and you will see us here every Thursday for 52 weeks,” Thomas said. “We hope this support helps everyone in the long run.”

Food insecurity remains a pressing issue in Indianapolis. Nearly 200,000 residents live in food deserts, which are areas with little or no access to grocery stores.

Nearly one in four children in Marion County is considered food insecure.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Fund’s Class I shares returned 7.05%, excluding sales charges.

Active rates positioning provided slight outperformance on the quarter driven by an overweight to the US, while an underweight to China detracted.

Security selection modestly outperformed on the month while foreign exchange had negative performance, driven by an underweight to Swiss franc, pound, Swedish krona, New Zealand dollar, and Canadian dollar.

The International Trade Administration Commission released its preliminary findings after a broad review of steel tariffs ordered by the government in March, as part of a response to oversupply, weak local demand and high input costs in South Africa’s steel industry.

ITAC recommended the government takes emergency action under World Trade Organisation rules to defend the sector and proposed import duties starting at 10 percent on steel products, it said.

Imports are estimated to meet around 35 percent of total domestic consumption, leaving companies such as ArcelorMittal South Africa, the country’s biggest primary steel producer, at risk of collapse and putting thousands of jobs in danger.

Among its preliminary findings, ITAC said “the ongoing geopolitical landscape does constitute an unprecedented emergency, necessitating urgent action in terms of Article 19 and Article 21 of the General Agreement on Tariffs Trade”.

Those rules allow WTO members to suspend or withdraw tariff concessions if “any product is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers”.

ITAC called on policymakers to consider whether the trade conditions amount to an emergency in terms of the WTO rules, its Chief Commissioner Ayabonga Cawe told Reuters in an interview.

Cawe said steel import restrictions imposed by the European union and the United Kingdom in recent months raised concerns of dumping and diversion in markets such as South Africa.

Although the regulations did not expressly authorize case-mix adjustments for CAHPS measure scores, they referred to case-mix adjustment in a way that assumed it was taking place.

A federal district court in Texas has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by CMS in a lawsuit filed by Elevance Health, Inc., challenging the agency’s calculation method for arriving at Star Rating half-star scores. Elevance did not argue that the case-mix adjustment process in and of itself was arbitrary or capricious, rather, it contended that the case-mix adjustment of survey-based data gathered from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) was not authorized by any statute or regulation. The court disagreed, finding that the regulation governing Star Ratings at several points assumed that various measures will have been adjusted already (Elevance Health, Inc. v. Kennedy, No. 4:24-cv-01064-P (N.D. Tex. Aug. 18, 2025)).

Star Rating system. CMS assigns a Star Rating to every contract it makes with a Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO). CMS issues the Star Ratings in half-star increments based on statutory and regulatory guidelines. For MAOs like Elevance, a mere half-star difference can mean the difference in hundreds of millions of dollars in potential federal funding. Elevance contended that CMS arbitrarily and capriciously kept some of its contracts from reaching the next highest half-star tier in the 2025 Star Ratings.

The process used to assign Star Ratings to MAO contracts is a complex composite of several measure-level ratings. CMS assigns measure-level ratings to each contract based on around 30 quality measures. CMS gathers the data needed for the Star Ratings in several ways, including the use of survey-based data gathered from CAHPS, and other data collected as part of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS). The two sources are called CAHPS measures and non-CAHPS measures, respectively.

Case-mix adjustment. For CAHPS measures, CMS applies a case-mix adjustment, which is an adjustment to the measure score made prior to the score being converted into a Star Rating to take into account certain enrollee characteristics that are not under the control of the plan. Case-mix adjustment aims to control for traits of a contract’s enrollees that would otherwise tend to skew the data from that pool.

After the measure-level ratings for contracts have been calculated, CMS weights the ratings by importance and then takes the average, with the result being a raw score between one and five stars. Because it is the average of several weighted measurements, the exact number can have (and presumably often does have) a long or non-terminating decimal. CMS calculates the raw score to at least six decimal places and rounds a contract’s raw score to the nearest half star, as required by statute. Regulations specify that CMS must follow “traditional rounding rules.” However, the parties disagreed on how the traditional rules apply when rounding to the nearest half.

Arbitrary and capricious. Elevance is the “parent organization” for five contracts with CMS at issue in the instant case: H3655 (3.5 stars), H5427 (4 stars), H6078 (3 stars), H2593 (3.5 stars), and H8849 (3.5 stars). Elevance sued HHS and CMS, arguing that the calculations of the 2025 Star Ratings were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law because CMS deviated from its statutory and regulatory authority when it adjusted the CAHPS measure scores; and CMS did not follow traditional rounding rules correctly when it rounded the Star Ratings, causing rounding down to 3.5 stars when 4 stars was correct. Elevance did not argue that the case-mix adjustment process, in and of itself, was arbitrary or capricious; rather, that the case-mix adjustment of CAHPS measures was not authorized by any statute or regulation.

As to the first claim, the court found that in fact, the regulations do not specify which measures should be case-mix adjusted, but that the regulation governing Star Ratings at several points assumes that various measures will have been adjusted already. Furthermore, the court found that it may have been arbitrary or capricious for CMS not to make case-mix adjustments to survey data. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment to CMS on the issue of the case-mix adjustments to CAHPS.

Traditional rounding rules. The court next turned to the issue of whether CMS adhered to the requisite rounding rules. CMS takes the average of all the measure-level ratings weighted by importance and produces that contract’s raw score, and it then rounds that number to the nearest half, using traditional rounding rules, to arrive at the final Star Rating. The regulations define “traditional rounding rules” as meaning that the last digit in a value will be rounded. The Star Rating regulations required CMS to round a contract’s score not to the nearest whole number, but to the nearest half.

The court determined that Elevance’s argument to the contrary was based on a fundamental misapplication of the rounding rules: they confused rounding the final Star Rating with rounding for display purposes. The purpose of rounding the final Star Rating was to simplify the measurement process; otherwise, CMS would have to treat each contract according to a sliding scale rather than a set of increments, and as a result, an enormous degree of administrative efficiency would be lost. Instead, by rounding to the nearest half star, CMS placed contracts into ascending tiers and quickly determined what benefit to award to certain providers from contract to contract. Accordingly, the court ruled that CMS was entitled to summary judgment on Elevance’s arbitrary-and-capricious claim as to the alleged rounding error.

The case is No. 4:24-cv-01064-P.

SocGen highlights that realized EUR/USD volatility has been dampened by spot stabilization after the EU–US trade deal, but risks are building again. With Jackson Hole ahead and September’s US data likely pivotal, they see a compelling entry point to go long EUR/USD volatility.

Key Points:

Stabilization Pressure: EUR/USD spot stability this month has weighed on realized volatility.

Seasonality & Risks:

August volatility seasonality still has ~10 days left.

Trade risks remain amid extended China negotiations.

Geopolitical risk stays elevated with Ukraine war talks ongoing.

Event Risk Premium: SocGen’s FX Event Tracker shows a higher premium for Jackson Hole 2025 than in 2024, reflecting market caution.

September Inflection Point:

Key US data: NFP (Sept 5), CPI (Sept 10), FOMC (Sept 17).

If inflation rises further, Fed focus could shift to the labour market, leaving the USD vulnerable.

Strategic View: With volatility near a floor, investors are offered a strong entry point to go long EUR/USD vol.

Conclusion:

SocGen advises positioning long EUR/USD volatility now, with geopolitical and macro event risks set to intensify. The real test will come in September with US jobs, inflation, and Fed policy, likely dictating USD direction and vol breakout potential.",https://www.efxdata.com/static/images/insights/6.jpg?v63f21be9,N,,2025-08-21 22:06:08.161847

While commoner tennis fans pay $150 to $230 for ground passes for the privilege of waiting in hours-long lines for entrance, Honey Deuces and bathrooms, the rich, famous and connected are enjoying a very different US Open — with four- and five-digit price tags.

Many say the best experience is being up close to the action and sitting courtside, but it will cost you. Tickets are currently going for upwards of $21,000 on the United States Tennis Association (USTA) website.

Luca Mornet, 23, a full content-creator who lives in Manhattan, sat courtside last year after being invited by the shoe brand DSW. He gushes about the experience.

“It was so much fun to be so close to the players,” he told The Post. “You feel like you are about to get hit by the balls, but you aren’t. And [you see] the runners get the balls and the referee, it’s so cool.”

Courtside is also where you are likely to rub shoulders with celebrities. Hugh Jackman, Michelle Obama and Savannah Guthrie regularly sit in the front sections.

Some people sitting courtside also have access to a suite with private bathrooms. Others use the amenities — such as bathrooms and food stalls — on the stadium’s Club Level, which are much less crowded than on other floors. Club Level tickets also include a private entrance into Arthur Ashe and a dedicated security line at the entrance to the tennis center.

Last year, the Club Level concessions were the only place to get access to Cocodaq’s buzzy $100 “Golden Set” featuring six chicken nuggets, Petrossian caviar and creme fraiche. This year Cocodaq will also have a stall in the food village.

Some A-Listers prefer a suite experience — instead of, or in addition to, sitting courtside.

The President’s Suite is the closest thing Arthur Ashe Stadium has to the famed Royal Box at Wimbledon.

Then invite-only, two-story space has a private entrance, an elaborate candy bar, a top-shelf open bar and even a ballroom inside the space for private dinner parties. Those lucky enough to go inside also get access to courtside seats with the best views in the stadium.

At last year’s tournament, Alec Baldwin, Lin-Manuel MIranda, Anna Wintour, and Andy Roddick were among those who enjoyed the President’s Suite.

Another suite option is The Player Cafe, which is run by the USTA and includes courtside seats, a premium bar and a US Open gift. (Last year’s offering was a custom towel and hat).

Technically anyone willing to plunk down the cash can get access to The Player Cafe, but tickets — which start at $6,275 per person for early matches — have long been sold out.

American Express cardholders can buy tickets — costing from $1,600 to $10,300 — to the banking company’s suite, which features air conditioning and a full-bar.

A number of other companies have lavish suites available only to invitees.

In the Emirates suite, immaculately dressed flight attendants serve tennis fans food and drink in the same way they would in the airline’s famously luxurious first class cabin. This year, Emirates will debut a new caviar cart with Champagne and canapes.

In the Grey Goose suite a bartender makes specialty cocktails like the Big Foe (Grey Goose, St-Germain, fresh lime juice, mint leaves, and soda) while the Lavazza suite has a barista making expertly crafted espresso martinis.

The Moet and Rolex suites feature a unique amenity: potentially hanging out with Roger Federer, who is a brand ambassador for both companies and sometimes stops by.

Last year, Caroline Maggs, a 27-year-old MBA student and content creator, was lucky enough to be invited to the Ralph Lauren suite. Her parents had warned her about encountering terrible traffic and lines at the tournament, but her VIP experience didn’t feature any such inconveniences.

A private car dropped her off at a private, back entrance to the stadium. “We pulled right in, and as soon as we got there, an elevator took me to the suite,” she said. “There was no heavy lifting, no experience of not knowing where I am going or getting lost.”

The air conditioned suite, which was outfitted with wood paneling, white and navy furniture, and tennis memorabilia, had private bathrooms, a bartender serving Honey Deuce cocktails and Champagne. There was a lavish buffet, passed hors d’oeuvres and a whiskey tasting.

“Just when I thought it was over, they would come around with cookies shaped like tennis balls,” she recalled.

It was her first time at the Open, but now she can’t imaging doing it any other way.

“I feel like my experience is almost tainted forever,” she said. “I can never go as a normie.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/109894748.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-21 18:16:00.187182

Residents in and around North Battleford are assessing damage and cleaning up debris today after a powerful storm system tore through the region Wednesday evening, prompting a tornado warning and bringing hail, flooding, and damaging winds.

Environment Canada issued the warning just before 6 p.m., after tracking a severe thunderstorm near Hamlin, moving east at 60 kilometres per hour. The storm impacted multiple rural municipalities, including the R.M. of Battle River and R.M. of North Battleford, as well as Sweet Grass First Nation and Delmas.

Although no tornadoes have been confirmed to have touched down, Environment Canada said they’re still investigating reports. The storm brought with it large hail, heavy rain, and wind gusts surpassing 100 km/h.

In North Battleford, peak wind gusts were recorded at 129 km/h, according to Environment Canada’s Thursday morning report. The city also experienced hen egg-sized hail, measuring up to 51 millimetres.

While the tornado warning was lifted shortly after it was issued, the aftermath of the storm left its mark.

“There were a couple of manhole covers that popped, quite a bit of hail damage throughout the city, and a few trees down,” said Deputy Fire Chief Paul Perry. “But only minor calls, nothing too serious, no injuries, no accidents, no fires. So, it was all relatively good.”

Several streets in the city were briefly flooded, and debris from trees and hail littered roadways Thursday morning. Crews were quick to respond.

“I can confirm that city crews are out and working to mitigate any of the issues and clearing that debris from the street,” said Candace Toma, communications coordinator for the City of North Battleford. “We’re encouraging the public, if they notice anything, to report it through city hall or our online ticket system at cityofnb.ca.”

Damage reports are still being logged, but early indications show most were weather-related — particularly from hail.

Westland Insurance in North Battleford confirmed receiving over 25 calls for vehicle damage, along with four property claims and one farm-related claim as of Thursday morning.

Elsewhere in the region, hail reports included tennis ball to baseball-sized hail in Langham and Radisson, and golf ball-sized hail in Mendham and Blumenthal.

Largest Hail Reports (mm):

Langham: 64–73 (Baseball-sized)

Radisson: 64

North Battleford: 51

Blumenthal: 44

Peak Wind Gusts (km/h):

The City is continuing the cleanup and monitoring for further damage.

And, again, it’s it’s relatively sizable, so just hoping to get some more detail there.
So it’s it’s not really, nothing new and nothing beyond that.
We it’s it’s it’s not nothing special.","Kraft Heinz Co. reported its second-quarter earnings for 2025, surpassing Wall Street expectations for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company posted an EPS of $0.69, exceeding the forecasted $0.64, a 7.81% surprise. Revenue reached $6.35 billion, higher than the expected $6.25 billion. Despite these positive results, Kraft Heinz’s stock fell 3.85% in pre-market trading, closing at $27.46, reflecting investor concerns over a significant non-cash impairment charge and ongoing market challenges. According to InvestingPro data, 14 analysts have recently revised their earnings expectations downward for the upcoming period, suggesting continued caution in the market.

Key Takeaways

Kraft Heinz’s EPS of $0.69 beat the forecast by 7.81%.

Revenue reached $6.35 billion, 1.6% above expectations.

Stock price dropped 3.85% pre-market due to a $9.3 billion impairment charge.

Emerging markets posted 8% top-line growth.

Inflationary pressures and tariff impacts remain concerns.

Company Performance

Kraft Heinz demonstrated robust performance in Q2 2025, with significant growth in emerging markets and strategic investments in marketing and innovation. The company reported an 8% increase in top-line growth in emerging markets, with margin expansion contributing to overall financial health. InvestingPro analysis shows the company maintains a FAIR Financial Health Score of 2.2 out of 5, with particularly strong scores in cash flow and relative value metrics. Despite these gains, the company faced challenges, including a $9.3 billion non-cash impairment charge due to a sustained decline in stock price.

Financial Highlights

Revenue: $6.35 billion, up from forecasts of $6.25 billion.

Earnings per share: $0.69, surpassing the forecast of $0.64.

Marketing investment increased by 30 basis points, targeting 4.8% spend by year-end.

Earnings vs. Forecast

Kraft Heinz exceeded expectations with an EPS of $0.69, compared to the forecasted $0.64, marking a 7.81% positive surprise. Revenue also surpassed predictions, coming in at $6.35 billion against a $6.25 billion forecast, reflecting a 1.6% surprise. These results highlight the company’s ability to navigate a challenging market environment.

Market Reaction

Despite beating earnings expectations, Kraft Heinz’s stock fell by 3.85% in pre-market trading, closing at $27.46. This decline is attributed to investor concerns over the $9.3 billion impairment charge and broader market pressures. The current stock price is closer to its 52-week low of $25.44, indicating cautious investor sentiment amidst inflationary pressures.

Outlook & Guidance

Looking ahead, Kraft Heinz is focused on achieving double-digit growth in emerging markets and continuing its investments in marketing and innovation. The company anticipates a peak in commodity inflation in Q2, with potential relief in Q4. Tariffs are expected to impact margins by approximately 100-180 basis points. InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock is currently undervalued based on its Fair Value model, while maintaining strong free cash flow yields. Additional ProTips and detailed financial analysis are available to InvestingPro subscribers.

Executive Commentary

CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera emphasized the company’s strategic pricing approach, stating, ""We are pricing well below inflation. In fact, we expect the inflation to be about five to 7% this year, and we’re only passing about around 1% of the pricing."" CFO Andre highlighted the company’s cautious investment strategy, noting, ""We like to test investments before scaling them up.""

Risks and Challenges

Inflationary pressures: Expected to reach 5-7% in 2025, impacting cost structures.

Tariff impacts: Projected to affect margins by 100-180 basis points.

Impairment charges: The $9.3 billion non-cash charge reflects ongoing stock price challenges.

Market competition: Continued pressure from competitors in the food industry.

Consumer pricing: Limited ability to pass on costs to consumers may affect margins.

Q&A

During the earnings call, analysts focused on the potential for strategic transactions, seeking clarity on the $9.3 billion impairment charge. Questions also addressed the company’s pricing and promotion strategies, as well as innovation and growth challenges. Executives reiterated their commitment to strategic investments and financial discipline.

Full transcript - Kraft Heinz Co (KHC) Q2 2025:

Conference Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Kraft Heinz Company Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR.

Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR, Kraft Heinz: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Welcome to the Q and A session for our second quarter twenty twenty five business update. During today’s call, we may make forward looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risk and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today’s earnings release, which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10 ks, 10 Q and eight ks filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.

Additionally, we may refer to non GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today’s earnings release and the non GAAP information available on our website at ir.krafthimescompany.com under News and Events for a discussion of our non GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. I will now hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Abrams Rivera, for opening comments.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Well, you, Marie, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Listen, I’m pleased to report that our second quarter results came in line with our expectations with an improvement in year over year top line performance. Our investments in product superiority, manufacturing capabilities, and key areas of our business are starting to pay off. It’s driving momentum and giving us confidence to reiterate our 2025 full year outlook. And while we do not have any new news to report today in our consideration for these transactions, I do want to assure you that we are actively progressing on our evaluation with a focus on unlocking long term shareholder value.

With that, I have Andrew joining me, so let’s open the call for the Q and A.

Conference Operator: We’ll now be conducting a question and answer Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar, Analyst, Barclays: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning. Carlos, during the quarter, Kraft Heinz put out a release that the company was considering, you know, various strategic transactions to create value. As there’s nothing specific from the company yet, perhaps maybe we can talk a little bit more in generalities.

And there was obviously a report from The Wall Street Journal about potential business separation. I know you can’t comment on specifics, but I guess, how would you respond to investors that would say, you know, such actions oftentimes can be, nothing more than financial engineering moves that, you know, come with higher costs and dissynergies, you know, rather than sort of unlocking value. I’m I’m really just trying to provide maybe a forum where you can talk a little bit about these sorts of things maybe more in general, as as Kraft looks at a lot of different, possibilities, right, to to try and unlock value.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Well, thank you, Andrew. Always great to hear from you. Yeah. You know, as I said, you know, our board is working with urgency on our evaluation of those strategic options to unlock, as you said, long term strategic value creation. And, you know, what I will say also is, and I’ll remind our investors, is that, you know, we will operate with the same financial discipline you have come to expect from us.

And so any actions, if any, will be consistent with that goal of unlocking that long term shareholder value. And that’s essentially all I can say at this time. But thank you for your question.

Andrew Lazar, Analyst, Barclays: Yep. Gave it a shot. Thank you.

Conference Operator: Our next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.

Peter Galbo, Analyst, Bank of America: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bit more of a technical one, but but there was a pretty sizable, you know, impairment that was taken in in the quarter, and was just hoping to get a a little bit more detail. It it seemed like it was maybe more at the enterprise level, but I I didn’t know if that flowed down to any of the the brands in particular or if it’s at all tied to, you know, as you as you contemplate kind of strategic transactions and you think about, you know, moving moving different pieces like that the that the reporting change triggered the the impairment.

And, again, it’s it’s relatively sizable, so just hoping to get some more detail there. Thanks very much.

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: Sure. Thanks for the question, Peter. So, look, we we recorded a $9,300,000,000 noncash impairment charge, And the trigger for that was, only the fact that we have a sustained decline in the stock price, and that has reduced the carrying value of our intangible assets. We have been monitoring this for some time. We disclosed in our previously filed 10 q the risk that this could happen.

So it’s it’s not really, nothing new and nothing beyond that. This does not change the view that the basic value of the company, including the confidence and direction we have in the strategy.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Okay. Thanks very much.

Conference Operator: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Palmer, Analyst, Evercore ISI: I’m just wondering how you’re thinking about your pricing and promotion levels currently. Where do you see perhaps an opportunity to or a challenge, to, ramp up promotions or narrow price gaps? And where do you feel like, you know, you’ve taken the steps already that you you’re comfortable where you are versus your near in competition if even if that’s private label? And I have a follow-up.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Thank you, David. Let me start and then I’ll hand it off to Andre if you wanna give additional commentary. But guess I would just say as context, you know, we are we’re certainly a consumer centric brand, first of all, which means that we are making sure that our brands are our brands are gonna continue to build for the long term. And what you see from us is that we continue to invest make investments across the board. And that some of that investment is actually in pricing.

We’re including about a 100 bps in pricing year over year. And we also are, on top of that, investing another 30 bps in marketing so that we can reach about 4.8% of marketing as a percent of net sales by 2025, by the end of 2025, which will be the highest level in nearly a decade. So and and in terms of pricing, just one clarification that I will make is that if you look at pricing in North America, when you exclude the cost inflation, it’s actually negative. So that gives you a sense that we’re also being thoughtful about how to think about pricing.

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: Andre, anything else you would add? Well, as as we said before, we have built into the into the into our initial plan about $300,000,000 of investments. We have added a little more towards the second half. We have been concentrating the the investments mainly on the the key windows. You see more activity now in the third quarter, as we are now at the peak of the summer.

There there is some investments that you have saved for this moment as we have a lot of product renovations hitting the market and some core innovations hitting right now. So we concentrated efforts on that so we can have the new product, the extra marketing, and those investments all hitting at the same time to improve the the chance of success. So, I mean, beyond that, there is nothing to say. Carlos, I don’t wanna see.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Yeah. The the only thing I would add, David, here is is that it’s important to know that, you know, we are pricing well below inflation. In fact, we expect the inflation to be about five to 7% this year, and we’re only passing about around 1% of the pricing. So that we are, in fact, keeping the consumer in mind as we’re taking these actions on pricing. Sounds like you had another question, David?

David Palmer, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Yeah. No. Thank you for that. I just, you know, one thing I’m thinking about with regard to Kraft Heinz, particularly as you think about strategic actions and, you know, sort presumably, there’s there’s, parts of the business that might, garner a higher multiple than the others, is this this problem that we see across food right now where legacy parts of businesses that might be growthier are not doing as well as they might have done over the long term. And I’m wondering how you’re thinking about that with regard to, you know, whether it’s accelerate, protect, or balance.

We’re seeing, know, on average declines continuing in those in those businesses. You know, what what is your prospects, I guess, to make your growth parts growthy, you know, in the near term, particularly if you wanna shine a a good light on those parts of the business as you as think about strategic actions. Thanks.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Thank you. I gotta let me go back to the our strategy that we have been consistent following for the last eighteen months or so, which is we are making investments to make sure that we’re growing across an emerging markets, North America retail and away from home. And in fact, we are continuing to make investment to drive that growth and return capital to our shareholder. And when you look at our pillars, in fact, you know, in emerging markets, you saw we grew our top line by around 8% to both price and volume, at the same time expanding margins substantially. In fact, we now in emerging market have our highest OI margin ever.

If you look at North America retail and accelerate platforms, we actually investing also to power powered by the brand growth system, and we are executing through agile ways of working. And let me just say that if you look at the at the Nielsen data, IRI data over the last four weeks, in fact, when you exclude cold cuts and bacon that drove about 40% of the decline, the rest of the portfolio in total North America retail actually is improving substantially. In fact, in the latest four week, ex cold cuts and bacon, we are down 2.7%. Year to date, we’re down 4%. So you are seeing that the actions we’re taking in North America retail are also helping us drive the kind of improvements that we wanted to have seen in the business.

And finally, in away from home, we’re also expanding into footprints for distribution and driving new innovation into the marketplace. The last thing I will say is that we’re not done. We’re gonna continue to invest in the business because we are confident in the strategy. We’re making sure we spend continue to invest in marketing, like I said earlier. We continue to step our investment in ecommerce, which is helping us also drive our improvements in North America.

And, frankly, we also have a solid balance sheet that allows to and a strong cash flow that allows us to continue to make these investments. So we feel very good that when you look deeply into our growth pillars, all those actions and investment we’re making are, in fact, taking shape in order for us to be able to continue to drive the company towards long term success.

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: I think beyond that, we have, as we said before, have a lot of product renovation hitting the market right now behind mac and cheese, lunchables, mayo, just to name those three. We have, 20% market increase year over year expected to the second half. So the vast majority of all the the the meat increases are all happening now in in the second semester. We have, as we said, the step ups, some investments, on price, towards the the the key window that are still to come. So there is a lot more happening that we should con and we should continue to see it accelerate part of the portfolio in North America improving gradually throughout the remaining quarters.

Thank you, David.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Our next question is from Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs.

Leah Jordan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning. Just seeing if you could provide more detail on your sales trends across emerging markets. I I know there’s a big opportunity for distribution gains in away from home in the region. So it’s just curious how those gains have tracked versus your expectations so far this year, and how should we think about the pace of those gains in the back half versus the front half?

And and, really, what’s giving you the confidence in that double digit exit rate for this year?

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Great question. Thank you, Leah. Listen. I mean, I mentioned that we, in fact, were very pleased to see that the top line now grew about 8%. I think what behind those numbers, though, is the fact that the growth coming from both volume and price.

And the fact that we are doing that while actually increasing our our margins at the same time give us quite a bit of confidence that as we look at the end of this year, we should be able to be hitting a long term algorithm of double digit growth. And for us, we continue to see, you know, investment in our business, and it’s not gonna stop. You know, today already, it represent about 2 and a half billion dollar business of our of our business overall. And I think one other thing that it gives me confidence is the fact that when you look at step backs and you look at emerging market, it’s really a more simple portfolio. It is focused on taste elevation, in particular in our Heinz brand, and we have a strong go to market model.

So when you look at the double click of Heinz in emerging markets, you know, it actually grew about 18% year over year. So it is building on the strengths of our key brand in a simple in a business that we know how to operate with a model that we now have been able to replicate across markets. So it’s something that now we have been building on the success that we have in the past historically, and now we’re expanding to make sure that we’re growing in LatAm, growing in our Middle East Asia, and Middle East Africa and Asia. And I think for us, we continue to believe that this is a place where we have tremendous opportunity for now and for the long term. Thank you, Leah.

Leah Jordan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Thank you. And I all inflation and promotions that were pushed into the third quarter. You know, any color on the magnitude of that impact and how, what drove the timing shift and and how you view kind of those cost pressures around inflation today?

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Sorry, Liet. You got cut off at the beginning of the question. If you can repeat it.

Leah Jordan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Oh, sure. You had called out incremental inflation and promotions that were pushed from two q into three q. Just any color on the magnitude of that impact we should think about on a quarterly cadence basis? And then what was the driver of that timing shift for those two items, and how are you thinking about inflationary cost pressures today?

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: Look. Magnitudes is in the range of thirty, forty bps. Yeah. Thirty, forty bps. We it’s it’s it’s not nothing special.

It’s mostly the recognition, like, on the based on the inventory positions and the throughput, that’s how this inventories got recognized in the p and l. So that’s why it shifted q two, q three. So but nothing really beyond that.

Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR, Kraft Heinz: Great.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Thank you, Adam. Our

Conference Operator: next question is from Megan Klaab with Morgan Stanley.

Megan Klaab, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much. I wanted maybe a follow-up just on the organic sales growth in North America Retail. There was a comment in the prepared remarks that you expect gradual long term improvement in top line trends. And and clearly, it seems like just based on your comment around exit rate on emerging markets and and foodservice that the gating factor here continues to be North America Retail.

So maybe, you know, you can just update us on how you’re thinking about timing of of getting back to just maybe stabilization first and foremost in North America Retail. Thank you.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Thank you. You know, for me, what I would say is and if you go back to kind of the strategy was fueling our growth in in and that improvements in North America performance, it is all the fact that we have now invested in through our brand growth system back in our products. So we’re investing in our product superiority. We’re investing in better marketing. We’re praying investing in better tool with ecommerce investments that we have made over the last six months, and that is giving us the company that we continue to see that now play into the marketplace.

We ended last year with brand growth system impacting about 10% of our business. By the end of this year, will be about 40% of our business, disproportionately focused in North America accelerate platforms. And you can see how when we are applying them that methodology, that actually is driving our improvement in performance. In fact, let me give an example of Capri Sun, which is a business that we renovated. We invested back in the business.

We improved the marketing. We improved the products. We make sure that we highlighted the benefit that it could have with parents and kids that has no artificial flavors, that we have superior taste, that we have better qualities in terms of things that kids love to have, that we have better promotions partnering with places like Nintendo, that we bring in new ideas into marketplace like Capri Sun under with new promotional during promotional limited edition products, whether that is we bring in new begin to new channels, whether it’s club, whether it’s convenient. So you see how when we apply the brand growth system or a brand like Capri Sun, that is comprehensive investments we make, the improvement that it yields in our business. So that along with the fact that we continue to step up our marketing, as I mentioned earlier, about 30 bps to get us above 4.8% by the end of the year, You know, that that combination of the way we are investing, the fact that we’re investing more, and that we’re using agile way to work into them, take those learnings and apply it to the portfolio is a combination that we believe is the right the right tools in order to drive complete continued pro improvements in our North America retail business.

Max Gumport, Analyst, BNP Paribas: Okay. Thanks for that, Thank for your question.

Megan Klaab, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Thank you. And then and maybe just a quick follow-up for Andre on on the gross margin outlook. Inflation, I think, overall looks to be unchanged for the year at that 5% to 7%, obviously, a wide range. But would you be able to just update us on what base input cost inflation is versus tariffs if if that’s changed at all? And then how should we be thinking about, you know, what what carries into 2026?

Just what looks to be a given a kind of lower exit rate on on gross margin in in the back half relative to the first half? Thank you.

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: Yeah. So in terms of inflation before tariffs, we have the peak of the commodities hitting in q two, but some of that, in terms of P and L recognition, got pushed into q three, and we should ex I should expect that some sort of relief started in q four, so it should start to reach the inflection point. We still have pockets of high commodity inflation, particularly on the heat and coffee. Regarding the tariffs, the current expectation based on on the latest is an impact of approximately a 100 bps this year linked to to the tariffs. And if the tariffs remain as they are right now, it will create a a full year annualized impact of approximately a 180 bps.

So there will be some carryover, into that affecting 2,026. As I said before, there are a lot of actions in place for procurement teams and also for commercial teams to mitigate as much as we can, being mindful about their their current consumer situation. But but, some pricing is is required, and and that’s what we are doing.

Megan Klaab, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Our next question is from Max Gumport with BNP Paribas.

Max Gumport, Analyst, BNP Paribas: Hey. Thanks for the question. Sensors to our peers that have recently established their their off calendar FY ’26 outlooks have embedded some pretty meaningful margin pressure over the coming quarters from substantial reinvestment. I recognize, you know, with your marketing going to at least 4.8% of sales and media spending going up at least 20% year over year, you are also reinvesting, but it it still feels a bit less sizable than what we are seeing from some of these peers. So particularly in light of the continued volume declines, just wanna get a better sense for what’s giving you the confidence that your investment plans for this year are appropriate.

Thanks.

Andre, CFO, Kraft Heinz: Thanks for the question. Look. We as everything we do, we are always very disciplined in our investments, and we like to test investments before scaling them up. So we feel good about the actions that we are doing for this year. I think those are the right ones, and the magnitude are appropriate as well.

And as we said in the last earnings, if we we see the the results expect from them, we will not hesitate to step up. Keep in mind as well that we act we are actively expanding the the brand growth system to more brands as we speak. So it’s part of the reason as well where we decided to step up investments a little more beyond what we initially said last quarter. And as opportunities, show up as part of this assessment, we will we will continue to step up investments. You know?

At at this point, we’re really trying to grow the business in a way that we think is is the healthy, like, not through price, but through really stronger products and stronger attributes, stronger marketing, which takes more time, but that’s the right thing to do. But we we are going to step up investments if if it is if we deem appropriate. That’s for sure.

Max Gumport, Analyst, BNP Paribas: Thank you. Okay. I’ll I’ll leave it there. Thanks very much.

Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR, Kraft Heinz: Operator, we have time for one more question.

Conference Operator: Our last question is from Alexia Howard with Bernstein Research.

Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR, Kraft Heinz: Good morning, everyone.

Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR, Kraft Heinz0: Morning. Can I can I ask about the the pace of innovation? If I remember correctly, you were pretty low on the innovation front for much of the pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions, but it sounded as though you exited 2024 at a somewhat higher rate, but probably still quite a lot lower than peers. Can you talk about where you’re at today, as a percentage of sales, where you’d like to get get to over time, and how quickly, you could get there, just so we can get a sense for how quickly that might be ramping up? Thank you, I’ll pass it on.

Carlos Abrams-Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, Kraft Heinz: Thank you, Alexa, for your question. Let me I guess, let me just give you a little bit of context, which is, you know, for us, it’s important that when we define innovation, we’re also thinking through what are the places that we can, in fact, renovate many of our key products. So when we talk about our brand growth system, when the fact that allows us to focus on us making sure we bring the attributes to consumers they care about in our core business, that is actually a key part of also thinking through how do we maintain innovation within our business. And I I have to say, as you pointed out, I think that if we go back to 2022, I think the number on innovation was around 1.6% of our of our sales. By the end of the last year, it was about 3% of our sales.

So we’re gonna continue to drive from that investment and innovation to contribute a larger part of our business as we go forward. But I would say, it also is already paying off. So if you think about, you know, the innovation that we have brought in, like, the experience of bringing the Taco Bell restaurant experience to home, it is now the second year in which we’re growing that business double digit, and now we’re expanding to Canada. I mentioned earlier Caprisome bottle that we are now bringing into club. We’re bringing into single serve, and now it’s achieving, you know, high levels of velocities too, whatever we have taken that that product outside of the pouch.

And we’re also making sure that we continue to drive innovation in our Heinz business. I mean, whether that is looking at how do we take it into pasta sauce, which is happening across many of our business across both Europe and Latin America, but it’s also making sure that we continue to expand on our of the importance of our Heinz Mayo business across our international portfolio and continue to expand into new countries as we go into ’20 into 2026. So well, you’re right that we continue to see opportunities for innovation. Our focus continues to be making sure we have the right core products with the right renovation in those businesses, and at the same time, being thoughtful about how do we actually are bringing innovation to market market that has the long term opportunity to be here for many, many years. And I’m I’m pleased to what I’m seeing.

I also think that there’s more for us to do. The last thing I will say is it’s important to recognize. And when we talk about the brand growth system, it also creates and highlights opportunity for us to go after new innovation. So you’re gonna continue to see us go to marketplace, whether that is with the kind of focus on not only line extension and new exciting flavors, but ways in which we can actually continue to make sure our brands are relevant for now and for the future. More to come.

Thank you, Alexia.

Ann Marie Miguela, Global Head of IR, Kraft Heinz0: Thank you.

According to The Wall Street Journal, McDonald’s and its franchisees will reduce combo meal prices to approximately 15% below the cost of purchasing the items individually. The changes will take effect next month, and prices will vary by location.

“We recognize that consumers’ value perceptions are most influenced by our core menu pricing,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors and analysts on August 6, when McDonald’s reported its Q2 earnings. “We’re working closely and collaboratively with our U.S. franchisees on this opportunity, and we’re developing ideas for how we might address this as an entire system.”

In August, the company expressed concern about continuing declines in traffic from consumers with household incomes of $45,000 or less. Fast food visits by lower-income consumers dropped by double-digit percentages industrywide in the U.S. in the April-June period.

Kempczinski said lower-income consumers are feeling uneasy about tariffs and their impacts and about the employment outlook. McDonald’s is talking with franchisees about ways to reengage those customers, he said.

“Too often, if you’re that consumer, you’re driving up to the restaurant and you’re seeing combo meals priced over $10. And that absolutely is shaping value perceptions in a negative way,” Kempczinski said. “So we’ve got to get that fixed.”

Click here for more photos of the Brabus Rocket GTC.","Were you put off by Brabus’s decision to give the current-generation Mercedes-AMG SL a roof? If so, the tuner just showed off a new model that may be more to your liking.

The German shop just unveiled the Rocket GTC, which is the roadster counterpart to the Rocket GTS shooting brake. The new build may lack a roof, but it still packs close to 1,000 horses under the hood.

Last fall, Brabus unveiled its latest outrageous take on Mercedes’s iconic grand tourer. The Rocket GTB came with the usual host of performance upgrades and over-the-top add-ons, but what really separated it from the AMG SL 63 S E Performance was that it featured a roof that extended all the way to the rear of the vehicle.

The Rocket GTC is aimed a Brabus fan that’s looking for something a little closer to the traditional SL experience. The cabriolet, hence the “C” in its name, wears a sculpted, carbon-fiber body kit that accentuates all the base vehicle’s existing aero elements—in particular, its rear ducktail spoiler. Initially, the model will be available exclusively in a dazzling coat of Deep Red with carbon-fiber accents. It rides on a staggered set of color-matching five-spoke monoblock “Platinum Edition” wheels with a center-lock design. The rims measure 21 inches in the front and 22 inches in the back.

WATCH

Inside, the vehicle looks bolder than ever. Nearly every single surface of the two-seat cabin is covered in red leather, with the seats featuring the shop’s trademark scalloped pattern. There is also Brabus branding nearly everywhere you look, from the steering wheel to the seatbacks.

The Rocket GTC will turn heads, of course, but its most attractive piece is hidden beneath its hood. There you’ll find an even more powerful version of AMG SL’s hybrid-assisted V-8. The mill’s displacement has been boosted from 4.0 liters to 4.5 liters, thanks to which the electrified setup is capable of churning out 973 hp and 1,342 ft lbs of torque (the latter figure is electronically limited to 1,195 ft lbs of torque for mechanical reasons). With all that might under the hood, Brabus’s latest creation is capable of shooting from zero to 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and hitting a top speed of 197 mph.

If you’re interested, Brabus is taking orders for the Rocket GTC now. You’ll have to ask for the price, but rest assured it’s well north of the range-topping SMG SL’s $208,300 starting price.

In March, the Company announced it will invest $55 billion to support U.S. manufacturing, research and development, and technology investments over the next four years.

Progress continues in the construction of the Wilson, North Carolina facility, which will employ more than 500 people when fully operational and create approximately 5,000 construction jobs during the site development.

Other investments include extensive R&D infrastructure aimed at developing lifesaving and life-changing treatments in areas such as oncology, neuroscience, immunology, cardiovascular disease, and robotic surgery.

Using the facility at the state-of-the-art FUJIFILM site in Holly Springs will allow the Company to further expand its manufacturing capacity in the U.S., and across the U.S., the Company’s investments will support thousands of jobs.",,N,,2025-08-21 18:15:03.134457

As is the case for its other Nismo models, Nissan doesn’t stop at visual changes for the sportiest X-Trail version.
Since the X-Trail is the international version of our Rogue, it could be fairly easy for Nissan to bring this Nismo version to North America, but we don’t expect it at least before 2027.
Horsepower and torque are rated at 213 hp and 243 lb-ft for the European X-Trail e4orce, figures that seem to hold true for the Nismo version as well.
More details about the 2027 Nissan Rogue and a possible Nismo version should be released in the coming months.","The Nissan X-Trail will now be available in Nismo form in Japan

Apart from esthetic changes, the e4orce hybrid all-wheel drive system is revised for better dynamics.

We don’t know yet if the closely related North American Rogue will get a similar treatment.

Following on from the Ariya Nismo and the Armada Nismo, Nissan is introducing a sporty version of its X-Trail compact SUV in Japan.

Like the other models mentioned, the X-Trail Nismo differentiates itself from the rest of the lineup with its red accents all around the base of the bodywork, its unique front splitter, rear diffuser and side skirts, along with exclusive 20-inch wheels wearing Michelin Pilot Sport tires.

Things are similar inside, where the X-Trail Nismo can be equipped with more supportive Recaro front seats trimmed in black suede with red leather bolsters that match the red accents on the dashboard and steering wheel.

As is the case for its other Nismo models, Nissan doesn’t stop at visual changes for the sportiest X-Trail version.

Indeed, the revised lower bodywork is functional, increasing downforce by 29% compared to the base model X-Trail for better handling at high speeds.

In addition, the standard e4orce electric all-wheel drive system is retuned to send more power to the rear wheels under acceleration and to provide a torque vectoring effect while cornering.

The suspension has also been modified accordingly, with Nissan’s first use of Kayaba Swing Valve shock absorbers that minimize body motions while maintaining a high level of comfort, according to the automaker.

The electric power steering has also been firmed up to provide better control when cornering at high speeds.

Since the X-Trail is the international version of our Rogue, it could be fairly easy for Nissan to bring this Nismo version to North America, but we don’t expect it at least before 2027.

Indeed, this is because the X-Trail Nismo is built on the ePower hybrid powertrain, which we are scheduled to get in the Rogue in a little over a year from now.

Nissan to Launch Third-Generation e-Power Hybrid in U.S. with Next-Gen Rogue

Based around the same variable-compression turbo 1,5L three-cylinder engine that currently powers the Rogue, this technology exclusively uses electric motors to power the wheels, relegating the gasoline engine to the role of a generation only.

This is a similar configuration to the former Chevrolet Volt and BMW i3 Rex.

In Europe, the X-Trail ePower is available with either one electric motor (front wheel drive) or two (e4orce electric AWD). Only the second one is expected to reach our market since the Rogue currently offers standard all-wheel drive.

Horsepower and torque are rated at 213 hp and 243 lb-ft for the European X-Trail e4orce, figures that seem to hold true for the Nismo version as well.

There is no guarantee that the Rogue will receive the Nismo treatment even once the ePower system becomes available, however, since the Ariya Nismo, available in Asia and Europe, has yet to make it over here despite being very similar across global markets.

More details about the 2027 Nissan Rogue and a possible Nismo version should be released in the coming months.",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250821-01_X-Trail_NISMO_drive_109-source.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 21:06:33.481518

McDonald's has also realized that and now says they're lowering prices to drive more traffic to the company.

Combo prices will eventually end up being 15% less than the total cost of buying each combo item separately, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The change up comes as McDonald's has been adding to their menu after two consecutive quarters of sinking sales, according to CNN. That trend was broken by reintroducing the Snack Wrap to the menu, introducing spicy chicken and chicken tenders, and marketing for the Minecraft movie, the live-action video game movie starring Jack Black which grossed almost $1 billion worldwide.

Value items and combos have also made a resurgence at the chain with the $2.99 price of a Snack Wrap running through the rest of the year, the $5 meal deal and their buy one, add one for $1 deal on certain menu items.

Prices vary by location, resulting in the company coming under fire online for having an $18 Big Mac meal last year.

The WSJ reports McDonald's is offering ""financial support"" to locations lowering their prices.

CEO Chris Kempczinski previously said low- and middle-income customers weren't spending at McDonald's due to high prices and general inflation. It prompted the company to freshen up the menu with new items, value deals and promotions.

He also said consumers are often seeing combo meals costing more than $10, which is ""shaping value perceptions in a negative way,"" and they ""got to get that fixed.""

Inflation and the uncertainty around the U.S. economy have customers wary to spend at fast-food chains, according to the WSJ. So much so, traffic to restaurants has fallen nearly 2% this year and is down nearly 3% for fast-food spots, according to market-researcher Black Box Intelligence.

“Immigrants are a driving force behind America’s prosperity. We need immigration policies that reflect that, instead of investing billions of dollars into detention, deportation, and making it incredibly difficult for foreign workers to come here or even renew their visas. These reckless policies undermine America’s greatest competitive advantage: the talent and drive of immigrants,” said Nan Wu, director of research at the American Immigration Council.

Businesses founded by immigrants or their children continue to transform entire industries, from technology to retail to media. Companies on the list include Amazon, Apple, NVIDIA, Levi Strauss & Co., Ace Hardware, and Sirius XM Holdings.

H&M has learned through customer surveys that the L.A. shopper values a seamless, elevated in-store visit.
H&M at The Original Farmers Market, at 6333 West 3rd Street, opens with the brand’s latest pre-fall arrivals across womenswear, menswear and accessories.
“It’s about showing H&M in its best possible light to our customers and audience, and being as inspiring as we can for them.” Long-term plans for H&M stores across the Americas focus on continued revamps.
H&M’s sales grew 1 percent in local currencies for the three months ended May 31.","H&M’s new Los Angeles flagship is a blueprint for its next generation of stores.

As the city prepares to host global events, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympics, the Swedish retailer on Thursday unveiled its reimagined in-store concept in the U.S. with the opening of a two-story, 15,000-square-foot space at The Original Farmers Market by The Grove.

Cameras flashing, Paris Hilton made a special appearance at the ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark its official opening.

“We do make sure that we are investing in places where we see the highest return,” said Michael Beaumont, head of expansion for H&M Americas. “I think L.A. at the moment is so hot and what’s on the calendar is so exciting.”

H&M, headquartered in Stockholm, operates 3,777 stores across 78 markets globally, including 671 across the Americas, with 76 in California and 20 in L.A. County. The location at The Original Farmers Market comes following closures in Sunset Plaza, Hollywood and Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Calif., as part of a broader strategy to streamline operations.

The new design builds on H&M’s Times Square store format in Manhattan that opened in November 2024, carrying over elements that have resonated with customers while refining the layout to be more “agile” and adaptable to changing trends, Beaumont said.

The L.A. location is the first U.S. store to debut the refreshed look, following similar rollouts in Europe earlier this year at H&M stores in Athens and Madrid — while adapting to the local setting.

“We’re lucky enough to have a row of palm trees next to us that really frames our store nicely. We also have really large windows that allow that gorgeous L.A. sunshine in,” Beaumont said. The open-air mall is ideal for the store given its lively atmosphere, openness and walkability, he added.

“It just has that quintessential L.A. look and feel….It’s a property we’ve had our eye on for quite some time,” he said.

Inside, the store takes on a gallery-like feel with curved walls, translucent displays and sleek wooden fitting rooms, while offering mobile checkout, in-store pickup from online orders and large LED screens showcasing the latest campaigns. The enhancements will serve as a model for upcoming stores, starting with São Paulo on Saturday in Brazil, a new market, followed by BLVD Las Vegas in September and Toronto’s Yorkdale Shopping Centre in November, with further rollouts planned through spring 2026.

Overall, it’s a more efficient shopping experience, Beaumont said. H&M has learned through customer surveys that the L.A. shopper values a seamless, elevated in-store visit.

“We’ve really taken a lot of time to make sure that we’ve listened to the customer feedback and make sure that design is in tune with what they expect, and also the speed at which we can help customers,” Beaumont went on. “We’ve really made progress in how we can satisfy that L.A. customer, because we do understand that we’re in a very competitive industry, and I think the customer service is one of the features that this store will show that really makes a positive difference for us.”

The store runs on radio frequency identification technology, which is used to track inventory and manage products more efficiently.

“This allows for really next level stock accuracy and also the opportunity to quickly look up products within the store,” he explained. “This really empowers our colleagues in the store to get the customers what they’re looking for as quickly and as efficiently as possible. It also allows for faster replenishment from the stockroom. So the stock we have on the shop floor, it won’t feel as much in terms of volume, we can keep volumes nice and low to really showcase the garments.”

Current bestsellers in the Americas, and specifically in the L.A. area, are denim trousers. Wide-leg fits are leading sales, according to H&M, reflecting a demand for relaxed silhouettes, along with transitional pieces like light knitwear and printed T-shirts. Online, trousers, dresses and footwear continue to be key growth drivers, noted the company.

H&M at The Original Farmers Market, at 6333 West 3rd Street, opens with the brand’s latest pre-fall arrivals across womenswear, menswear and accessories. The store will also carry designer collaborations and special collections, including its more elevated lines H&M Studio and Atelier, which is specifically designed for men.

“We have a hyper-focus on L.A. at the moment, because it is such a key market for our fashion aspirers,” Beaumont said.

The retailer is further expanding in the region with three additional openings: a relocated store at the Beverly Center on Oct. 10, a new shop in Brea, Calif., and a stand-alone location in Beverly Hills in November. Four existing stores — at Westfield Century City, Westfield Culver City, FIGat7th in downtown L.A. and Northridge Fashion Center — have also been remodeled.

“It’s a very interesting store in Beverly Hills that we’re calling a brand infuser,” Beaumont said.

Beverly Hills will stand apart with a smaller, highly curated store selection and design that showcases the brand in a “fashion-forward” way, he continued. “It will be bespoke furniture, bespoke interior, designed in-house.” The concept has already appeared in London, Stockholm and New York’s SoHo.

“It comes down to market analysis and how we can offer a different look and feel for our different customers,” Beaumont said, when asked about tailoring H&M stores to different audiences. “I think what we’ve seen is that if we can offer a customer a really curated experience, then we’re going to have more success in that location.”

H&M brought that vision to life in April, producing a large-scale music festival ahead of Coachella at Ace Mission Studios in Boyle Heights. Part of an ongoing global concert series, the event featured performances from Doechii, Robyn, Jamie xx, PinkPantheress and Sailorr, drawing roughly 5,000 guests — including Hollywood names like Dakota Fanning, Riley Keough and Barbie Ferreira, all dressed in H&M’s spring 2025 collection.

“In L.A., our approach has been through events that bring people together,” Beaumont said. “It’s about showing H&M in its best possible light to our customers and audience, and being as inspiring as we can for them.”

Long-term plans for H&M stores across the Americas focus on continued revamps. There will be 16 new store openings by the end of this year in the region, and 75 remodels.

“For the portfolio as a whole, we will be investing in remodels of stores all across the board,” Beaumont said. “Some of these will be large scale, and some will be relatively light, but there’ll be hundreds of stores getting remodeled over the coming years, not just in how stores are laid out or the interior that we’re using, but also the technology backbone as well.”

The openings and remodeled stores are a key part of H&M’s strategy to turn around its business against stiff competition from the likes of Zara. The Swedish retailer has struggled over the last several years, but saw improvement in the second quarter as its efforts began to take hold. H&M’s sales grew 1 percent in local currencies for the three months ended May 31. On a reported basis, the company had second-quarter net sales of 56.71 billion Swedish kronor, or $5.96 billion at current exchange, down 4.9 percent year-on-year, largely due to a stronger Swedish kronor.

The stronger kronor impacted sales in North and South America as well, where sales dipped 2 percent to 25.22 billion Swedish kronor but rose 2 percent in local currencies. The impact was even greater in the second quarter, where sales were down 8 percent to 12.02 billion Swedish kronor but were up 3 percent in local currency terms.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/h-and-m-store-la-grove-wwd-MB-07.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-08-21 17:15:21.402175

First, going to start with Strategy, a company formerly known, of course, as Micro Strategy, seeing shares sliding as one analyst sees more struggles ahead for that name.
Yeah, I think there are legitimate questions and worries about how much debt Strategy, Micro Strategy, whatever you want to call it, is taking on to buy this massive amount of Bitcoin.
And at the end of the day, you can be bullish on crypto, and then you can buy Bitcoin, or you could buy the IBIT ETF.
You don't necessarily need to buy MSTR, which now has really de-emphasized its software business in the name of becoming the preeminent Bitcoin Treasury company.","All right, now time for some of today's trending tickers. Barron's Paul La Monica is right here with me. We're going to take a look here at Strategy, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Instacart. First, going to start with Strategy, a company formerly known, of course, as Micro Strategy, seeing shares sliding as one analyst sees more struggles ahead for that name. And Paul, Strategy, a leveraged play really on Bitcoin, and I'm reading in Barron's, the August publication, and what your house is talking about here is they kind of detail the drop in the stock for the past month, and they cite an analyst from Mizuho Hart Paul, who reiterated a sell. That market cap to Bitcoin multiple bound to decline in part, Barron's pointing out here, because of the credit market skepticism of the debt that Sailor's company has issued to finance some of its purchases. What do you make of it?

Yeah, I think there are legitimate questions and worries about how much debt Strategy, Micro Strategy, whatever you want to call it, is taking on to buy this massive amount of Bitcoin. And at the end of the day, you can be bullish on crypto, and then you can buy Bitcoin, or you could buy the IBIT ETF. You don't necessarily need to buy MSTR, which now has really de-emphasized its software business in the name of becoming the preeminent Bitcoin Treasury company. It, as you said, it's very leveraged to Bitcoin. It's going to be incredibly volatile, and as we've seen, Bitcoin is still an asset that is incredibly fluctuates very wildly. So that makes it difficult, I think, for investors to have any confidence that Micro Strategy is going to be nothing but as volatile as Bitcoin.

Yeah, down there. We should note, I mean, Wall Street loves this name, Paul. I mean, near 90% of a buy on this one, not many skeptics on the street.

No, and there's something to be said for what Sailor has done to make them a kind of tertiary enterprise software player into the world's largest Bitcoin Treasury. You do have to take off your hat to that, but it's just a very expensive and risky company.

All right, let's move on to another one. Hewlett Packard Enterprise getting lift over at Morgan Stanley from upgrading that stock from equal weight to overweight, noting upside to earnings. So Morgan Stanley Paul, okay, they take HPE to overweight. They're believers. Target 28. Sounds like next earnings announcement, September 3rd. The analyst is looking forward to the analyst day though, to hear, says, given we are likely to get his longer-term forecasts that could help the market more clearly appreciate HPE's future earnings and cash flow power. Analyst saying here he favors HPE and Dell into earnings. What do you think?

Yeah, I think HPE, there's a lot going for it. It also has that kind of AI wind at its back. But you know, HPE buying Juniper Networks, that I think is something that analysts are very excited to see how that helps the company. You know, Juniper, of course, was a once market darling competing with Cisco. You know, it's going to be something that I think will increase HP's own offerings as well in, you know, infrastructure and networking. So you know, I think that's why there's some of the bullishness there.

All right, final one I want you to take on here, Paul, that would be Instacart. Here with a downgrade at Wedbush. The firm lowering its rating on that stock from neutral to underperform. They go to the equivalent of a sell, Paul. Here's what they say, the recent expansion of Amazon's same-day perishable grocery delivery service has intensified the competitive environment. They say we recognize Instacart may carve out a specialized focus, they say, but we believe consumers will opt for more compelling and value-driven services. They lower their target to 42.

Yeah, I mean, Instacart obviously faces a formidable threat, and they already had from Amazon because of its grocery business, because of Whole Foods. But also, I think Walmart, that really is the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in groceries, both buying them in the store and delivery. But Instacart does have some pretty powerful relationships with a lot of the major supermarket chains out there and other retailers. They obviously aren't just delivering from places like, you know, Kroger and what have you. They also have some partnerships with Best Buy and other specialty retailers. So I I wouldn't necessarily say that it's the time to be burying Instacart just yet. There are some companies that have been able to go toe-to-toe with Amazon and and hang in there. I think Instacart might be one of those.

Now to your point, this is the only sell I see on the street, by the way. Most analysts still like this one.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n7ru37w8mt9okpn1_ecjbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/50ee1fa0-7ec7-11f0-bff1-b4cdfb552d7f,N,,2025-08-21 18:14:58.794469

“Instacart has demonstrated healthy gross transaction volume (GTV) growth and an improving margin trajectory over the last few quarters, tempering some investor concern,” the analysts wrote.

“That said, the recent expansion of Amazon’s same-day perishable grocery delivery service has intensified the competitive environment.”

Wedbush said it views Amazon’s move as “a pivotal step forward in Amazon's broader strategy to capture incremental share in the category.”

The firm noted that Amazon is capable of meeting logistical challenges that many grocers typically rely on third parties like Instacart to address.

“Following the announcement, we think Prime has become an even more compelling subscription for grocery shoppers, diminishing the appeal of Instacart,” the analysts wrote.

At the same time, Instacart’s share of the grocery delivery market has slipped. “The company's market share relative to Uber, DoorDash, and others has fallen to 58% in 2024 from 70% two years prior,” Wedbush wrote, adding that major retail partners could increasingly direct online grocery demand to their own first-party platforms.

Wedbush also flagged concerns about Instacart’s long-term outlook. “We are increasingly cautious on management’s ability to achieve its longer-term targets as competitive pressures build,” they wrote.

The analysts anticipate that more customers will direct orders to competitors, resulting in only low to mid-single-digit annual GTV growth for Instacart in the later years of the forecast.

It added that the company may need to spend more on incentives, sales and marketing to attract and retain customers.

As a result, Wedbush reduced its estimates for the business. The firm now expects fourth quarter GTV and adjusted EBITDA to come in about 1% and 2% below consensus, respectively.

For 2026, Wedbush projects GTV growth of 7.1% year-over-year, down 200 basis points from its prior forecast, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, or a 29.5% margin, about 3% lower than its earlier view.

“Following these revisions, we lower our price target to $42 from $55 previously,” Wedbush said.

Niccol also said in the previous earnings call that the brand would be testing more gluten-free and high-protein options to meet guests’ changing dietary needs.

Earlier this year, Starbucks eliminated added sugar from its matcha powder so that customers could control the level of sweetness for their matcha beverages. Last November, the company also eliminated upcharges for plant-based milk alternatives, following years of protests from advocacy groups.

Clinical Factors

According to a report on Reuters, CVS, which operates the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said it will not add Gilead’s new HIV prevention drug, Yeztugo, to its commercial plans at this time.

According to the article, CVS based its decision on “clinical, financial, and regulatory factors.” The company also will not cover Yeztugo under its Affordable Care Act formularies, as its ACA preventive program follows recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

This comes despite Gilead, back in June, hailing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Yeztugo. Its share price has been on the rise since that decision.

Yeztugo is an injectable treatment aimed reducing the risk of acquiring HIV through sex. It is aimed at adults and adolescents weighing at least 35kg and is the only twice-yearly option available in the U.S.

Data showed that 99.9% of people who received it in a trial remained HIV negative.

Hope Remains

Gildead called it a “historic day in the decades-long fight against HIV.” The company has also said that it is “well on our way to achieving 75% access for Yeztugo within six months and 90% within 12 months.”

BMO Capital analyst Evan David Seigerman called the CVS development “an incremental negative to GILD” but noted that “CVS coverage delays are not yet concerning for Yeztugo broad coverage goals.”

He said that conversations with CVS are ongoing, and that the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) has yet to make a determination on adding Yeztugo as a covered drug.

Salim Syed of Mizuho suggested that upcoming coverage decisions from UnitedHealth (UNH) and Cigna (CI) could now be more significant catalysts than previously thought. They noted that CVS appears to be “pushing back on price for the injection(s) either straight up or when compared to daily pills.”

Is GILD a Good Stock to Buy Now?

On TipRanks, GILD has a Strong Buy consensus based on 19 Buy and 5 Hold ratings. Its highest price target is $143. GILD stock’s consensus price target is $125.05, implying a 6.87% upside.

Rollins, Gordon G. Chang, Thomas G. Moukawsher, John Davenport",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/epic-seth-hain-what-we-know-about-cosmos-ai-access-health-2117205,"I asked Seth Hain, Epic's senior vice president of research and development, to expand on the potential of Cosmos AI (read on to the ""Pulse Check"" section to hear what he said).
In Other News Major health care headlines from the week Could AI truly ""re-humanize"" health care?
Here's what he told me at UGM: At the general session this morning, you spoke about Cosmos AI and its progress.
As we started studying the Cosmos AI models that we were creating, we found that they could be applied across that whole spectrum.
Are you thinking of Cosmos AI as a clinical decision support tool?","This is a preview of Access Health—Tap here to get this newsletter delivered straight to your inbox.

It started the moment that I stepped off the jet bridge in Madison, Wisconsin. And it only got crazier from there.

A sign from Delta Air Lines welcomed attendees to ""UGM,"" Epic's annual User Group Meeting at their sprawling headquarters in the nearby town of Verona. Ads from Qventus, Suki and other health tech companies scrolled across screens at the baggage claim. I opened my LinkedIn app, and my feed was inundated with predictions and opinions: What would Epic announce? What could they do? What couldn't they do?

The first thing my Uber driver asked was, ""Are you here for Epic?"" He had been driving people to and from the conference all weekend. He hadn't been inside the complex yet, but he hoped to take a tour someday. Me, too. I was so busy typing out updates that I missed the campus tour organized for media (but a member of the team was kind enough to take me by the Harry Potter-themed buildings before I left for the day).

I had spent the week before UGM on back-to-back phone calls, because—as my Uber driver illustrated—everyone has something to say about Epic. I won't use this intro to recount what Epic itself said, because if you're reading this, you've probably heard the chatter. They're coming out with MyChart Central, a suite of AI tools known as Art (for providers), Emmie (for patients) and Penny (for revenue cycle), complete with ambient technology from Microsoft, and getting into the ERP game. You can read more on my live blog from Tuesday or on Epic's social media feeds.

The endless updates are fascinating, game-changing—and widely available. So instead of rehashing them here, I'll tell you what people are saying about them.

First off, there has been widespread concern about how Epic's ambient scribing features will impact start-up companies that offer the same feature. On Tuesday, Epic CEO Judy Faulkner said that customers can continue using third-party scribing tools as they've been doing. Epic even reiterated this in a statement shared with media: ""Customers can use other third parties to do Ambient AI as they do today.""

But the other third parties don't seem reassured by that promise. While customers do have a choice, it is difficult to envision a world in which they don't choose to maximize the benefits of their expensive Epic ecosystem. Epic's suite of AI tools will also be able to communicate with one another, offering a level of continuity that hasn't been achieved elsewhere.

""I think it's really tough to go against Epic with something they do first party, because it's hard to compete on price and it's hard to compete on quality,"" Muthu Alagappan, CEO and co-founder of Counsel Health, told me. ""In a competitive market, those are often two of your main dimensions for out-competing someone. Epic also has just much better native integrations with their own internal data, and so what they expose in an API to a third party, they're going to just have much cleaner, native access to the same data elements internally.""

Ahead of UGM, Dr. Joseph Sanford, chief clinical informatics officer at UAMS in Arkansas, said that his system is not considering an immediate shift to Epic's ambient scribing technology, since they're in the middle of a contract with Microsoft's Nuance. He told me that he hoped to see collaborations between Epic and Microsoft continue and serve as a ""rising tide for all parties.""

When the time comes to reassess, Sanford will be considering each vendor's history in their space, how robust their toolset is and whether it meets UAMS' specialized needs. And, of course, he'll be reading the price tags.

Despite Epic's solid reputation—it snagged 17 customers from competitor Cerner since UGM 2024—health system leaders aren't relying on blind trust.

""As good as Epic is, when you're a software company, you're always starting something up,"" Sanford told me. ""And so how much of the bleeding edge do we want to be on versus a kind of plug and play package?""

The term ""monopoly"" has come up in several of my conversations. Epic is a monopoly, health tech leaders tell me, and it is expanding, as monopolies do. The concern is that monopolies do not always have the depth to match their breadth. As the saying goes: ""Jack of all trades, master of none.""

It's a fair point, and one that can't be dismissed until these tools start rolling out early next year. However, Epic is not your average Jack. It has data from 325 million patients around the world and is used by 3,300 hospitals. Last year, it reported $5.7 billion in revenue. It has more than 12,000 employees who come to work five days a week on a 1,670-acre campus. It has doctors and software developers dressing up like Star Trek characters to explain AI models in space metaphors—and they had that 11,400-person auditorium on the edges of their seats. It is undeniable that they have creativity, customer loyalty and, most importantly, resources.

Of all the announcements that came out of UGM, I find the advancements in Cosmos AI most illustrative of that scale, that differentiation. Epic has access to an absolute abyss of data. All of it can be used as fodder for AI models, and as their new research illustrates, those models are likely to grow stronger as the dataset grows bigger.

I asked Seth Hain, Epic's senior vice president of research and development, to expand on the potential of Cosmos AI (read on to the ""Pulse Check"" section to hear what he said). I also asked him about the concerns I'd been hearing, that Epic may not be able to do it all and do it well.

""When we think about what projects and development work to do, we focus first on that North Star: how do we help providers take very effective care of their patients and work together [with them] in that regard,"" Hain told me. ""With that as a backdrop, it becomes a question of, given what folks use the software for today, where can we complement that in a meaningful way that works towards that North Star?""

He continued, ""I think the things we shared today are directly in line with that, and so we'll continue to focus on those capabilities that provide ongoing and increasing value to physicians and nurses and patients directly through MyChart and the hospital operations group, and increase the amount of functionality to help those folks. Where there's things we could do, but it doesn't complement that [North Star], then they're not the things for us to spend time on.""

In summary, the most interesting thing I heard was actually something I overheard from a fellow UGM attendee on the airport shuttle: ""I can't imagine if you're on another shitty EMR how you keep up.""

I've asked around, but nobody seems to have an answer to that one.

In Other News

Major health care headlines from the week

Could AI truly ""re-humanize"" health care? Drs. Ben Ebert and Eliezer Van Allen of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute believe so. They spoke with Marcus Weldon—our contributing editor for AI and the president emeritus of Bell Labs—for the most recent installment of Newsweek'sAI Impact series.The interview explores Dana-Farber's plans for the first fully AI-enabled hospital,AI's potential to democratize health care and steps the industry must take to make these dreams a reality.At Epic UGM on Tuesday, President Sumit Rana said he spends ""an hour a day"" reading about AI. If you have time for one article today, I highly recommend Weldon's.

CLEAR, widely known for its frictionless airport security system, has announced a partnership with Tampa General Hospital to improve workforce identity security. In a joint case study, the partners said that they had automated 80 percent of account recovery requests using CLEAR's technology, cut their MFA reset time from 4.5 days to 20 minutes and reduced account-related support calls by 22 percent. This resulted in operational savings of approximately $70 per password reset.Earlier this month, CLEAR announced that its CLEAR1 product was under construction in Epic's Identity Verification for EpicCare Link Toolbox to bring these capabilities to more health care organizations.

Grow Therapy launched an AI tool called ""Between-Session Reflections"" on Tuesday, joining a growing list of health care organizations that are utilizing AI to maintain contact with patients between visits. The tool allows therapy clients to log their thoughts and feelings between sessions. They can respond to targeted, AI-generated journaling prompts about recent experiences or opt for free-form writing. The AI then generates a list of key themes that the client can choose to edit, send to their provider or delete.""Since most of life is happening outside of a session, a key aspect of therapy is knowing what to focus on in order to make each session as impactful as possible,"" Kevin Ramotar, director of clinical product at Grow Therapy, said in a news release.

CMS has created an oversight initiative to ensure that Medicaid and CHIP enrollees meet citizenship requirements.The agency said it will begin sending ""monthly enrollment reports"" to states, flagging enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed through federal databases.States will be responsible for obtaining any documentation necessary to confirm these enrollees' eligibility,and are expected to adjust coverage for those whom they cannot verify.The first set of reports was sent to some states on Tuesday, and all states will receive their reports over the course of a month, CMS said.

Executive perspectives on key industry issues

At UGM on Tuesday, Epic shared that its Cosmos AI technology had reached a ""significant milestone.""

CoMET—a family of models built on de-identified, longitudinal health records from 118 million patients and 151 billion medical events—had outperformed or matched task-specific models when tested on 78 tasks, including prediction of diagnosis and disease prognosis. The model also improved with time, becoming more accurate as the scale of the dataset increased, according to a research report produced by Epic, Microsoft Research and Yale School of Medicine.

In short: Epic's Cosmos dataset is advancing, and could eventually be able to predict health events across the course of a patient's lifetime. Imagine a world where doctors can anticipate a heart attack years before it happens, get a ""nudge"" with a patient's risk score and intervene early. That's starting to sound less like sci-fi and more like real life.

I sat down with Seth Hain, Epic's senior vice president of research and development, to learn more about Cosmos' progress and what it could mean for patients and providers. Here's what he told me at UGM:

At the general session this morning, you spoke about Cosmos AI and its progress. What can you tell me—off-stage—about the value this could bring to patients and health systems?

There has been a challenge, historically, in regard to using artificial intelligence techniques in health care software, where the rate at which it was applied and available was determined by building these individual bespoke models, one at a time, for individual conditions. And the thing we were deeply wondering about was, is there a way to build a generalized medical intelligence that could be applied broadly to help patients, physicians and health systems?

As we started studying the Cosmos AI models that we were creating, we found that they could be applied across that whole spectrum. Helping, say, a nurse with [procuring] a particular risk score in regard to patients that they might be monitoring on the floor of the hospital, is one simple application where it can be applied in place of one of those predictive models today—but across a far more diverse set of conditions, rather than building one for each individual condition.

Similarly, in the exam room or in the office, [Cosmos could be] able to help identify differential diagnoses, and just having that kind of extra moment so the physician can wonder, ""Did I think through all the options here, and is there anything else I can consider?"" The system [could] help prompt that in ways.

And then obviously, helping more broadly from a hospital and health system operations perspective, the first example I gave this morning was around length of stay. But we also talked about long-term risk of chronic diseases, as another example. And each of these help with everything from capacity in the hospital to helping manage populations of patients. So we see this one model—I mean, obviously we're going to build multiple models in the family, and they're going to grow over time—being able to generalize across all of those.

I think at the same time, it's really early. We don't know everything this model can do. We don't know everything this approach can do. And the reason we wanted to make sure we shared it with the community today was to engage them in starting to explore it through the Cosmos AI Labs, because in the same way that we've learned so much from the researchers across the Cosmos community around the data set—they're generating two papers or more a week now from the from doing research in Cosmos—we expect a similar type of effort will come into understanding Cosmos AI, and they're going to help figure out a bunch of new ways to help patients and clinicians with it. So I'm really most excited about what we don't know yet and what the community will find.

Are you thinking of Cosmos AI as a clinical decision support tool?

I think it's very important to separate two things here. In a weird way, a model alone does nothing. The model needs to be embedded into workflow in order to assist doctors, nurses, hospital operations. And so this question of ""Is it a clinical decision support tool?"" etc. is really about ""How does it surface in workflow?"" not ""Is it the thing?""

And in that regard, we want to engage the community and continue to understand it more deeply, so that as it does surface in different parts of clinical workflows, they can have a deep understanding of it beforehand. And the paper we published with Yale was really driven around helping build up that understanding. Yale contributed heavily, particularly around the medical evaluations that are included in that paper.

I'm curious if there are policy changes that will have to come with ""risk scores"" for certain conditions. For example, if a patient reaches ""X"" score, the payer and provider are obligated to respond in ""Y"" way.

I think this is a very important question, and I think if we take it up one level above that, a generalized medical intelligence means that many questions can be asked quickly, and in some ways, our governance processes, our regulatory structures, implicitly assume that models take time to create, and that the number of them in use is going to be limited as a result.

Cosmos AI points away towards a future where there could be many, many predictions on many different fronts, almost generated as quickly as the mind might ask the question. And so I do think it'll be important to engage the federal and state level, as well as obviously working closely with the Epic community to think through how those policies can evolve.

Executive Edge

How health care execs are managing their own health

Earlier this month, I connected with Dr. Tom Frieden. He's had quite the career in public health, serving as New York City health commissioner from 2002 to 2009, CDC director from 2009 to 2017 and now as president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative he started to prevent cardiovascular disease and epidemics.

He is also publishing a book, The Formula for Better Health, on September 20 via MIT Press. It contains a blueprint for effective leadership in complex industries like health care, arguing that better leaders will bring results—not more bureaucracy.

The book also contains some insights on health, naturally. I asked Frieden what he prioritizes to keep himself healthy. Here's what he told me (and what the data told him):

""What really became clear to me is there are six core behaviors to stay healthy, and then there are a handful of others that may be helpful to reduce illness, injury, disability and death. But the six big ones are (1.) blood pressure. And you know, the SPRINT trial is pretty clear: [a systolic blood pressure of] 120 is a lot better than 130 is better than 140.

And (2.) lipids and apolipoprotein B (APOB), we have way too little focus on this. I have a buddy I play squash with, I'm playing him this afternoon. He's 72 [years old] and he's got bad luck. His genes are such that his lipids are really high, and he does everything right. His diet is incredibly healthy. He gets lots of physical activity and he's seeing cardiologists. His blood pressure is 130 and his APOB is 90. Well he can reduce his risk of a heart attack, stroke or death by at least a third, just by tightening control of those two numbers.

The third is (3.) physical activity. And this is the wonder drug. It improves everything you'd like to improve.

The fourth is (4.) healthy nutrition, especially cutting out sugar and having more potassium than sodium. Other nutrition stuff is complicated.

The fifth is (5). getting enough sleep.

And the sixth is (6.) avoiding toxins, including alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and avoiding some of the toxins in our environment. There are other things that can be done as people age to prevent dementia and loss of functionality, from fully correcting hearing and vision to getting colon cancer screening. There's interesting new evidence that the shingles vaccine may prevent dementia that I review in the data [presented in the book]. There is this whole idea of technical rigor: how can we see the health of the future? This is a skill from public health, and it's something that's often lacking in clinical medicine, a kind of critical analysis of what the data really shows.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2707137/seth-hain.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 16:12:14.972468

Zacks Investment Research","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH and Elevance Health, Inc. ELV are two of the largest health insurers in the United States, each operating vast networks and diversified healthcare businesses. Today, both face intense headwinds: medical costs are running hotter than expected, regulatory burdens are mounting, and investors have grown uneasy after a string of disappointments. This year, each stock has seen significant declines, reflecting sector-wide uncertainty.

Shares of UnitedHealth have plunged 40.7% in the year-to-date period, while Elevance declined 16%. The broader industry has slumped 31.6% during this time, while the S&P 500 Index witnessed 8.8% growth, backed by tech-related stocks.

While both insurers have endured recent pressure, their operational strategies and financial resilience differ in critical ways. Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which company is better positioned to restore investor confidence.

The Case for UnitedHealth

UnitedHealth remains the industry’s heavyweight, with a market cap of $275.5 billion, nearly four times Elevance’s $70.3 billion. Its debt profile is stronger too, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.03 compared to ELV’s 2.47.

UNH delivers insurance coverage through UnitedHealthcare and health services via Optum, integrating provider, pharmacy-benefit and analytics services. This vertical integration gives UNH strong insight and influence over cost drivers and care utilization. Its operational scale and bargaining power help it negotiate more favorable provider and pharmaceutical contracts compared to smaller players.

In recent quarters, despite cost pressures, UNH has consistently generated robust cash flow, giving it the flexibility to keep investing in growth and weather downturns. That said, cracks are showing: the company lowered its outlook (even pulled it for a brief period) after missing estimates for the first two quarters of 2025.

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Quote

Medicare Advantage and Medicaid segments have seen margin pressure from unexpected utilization spikes, injecting near-term uncertainty. However, UNH’s diversified business lines and ability to pivot through Optum’s services provide it with multiple levers to respond to such volatility. The recent Amedisys acquisition extends its reach into in-home care, a move expected to curb medical costs by reducing hospitalizations.

Adding to its credibility, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recently disclosed a $1.57 billion stake of more than 5 million in UNH, as of June 30, 2025. Buffett’s seal of approval often sparks a wave of copycat buying, reinforcing market confidence in the long-term story.

The Case for Elevance

Elevance also benefits from structural tailwinds like an aging population and expanding into government programs. Its Carelon platform is driving digital and AI-enabled solutions to personalize care, cut costs and sharpen margins, pillars of its future competitiveness.

During the first half of 2025, Elevance managed to generate 15.5% growth in premiums, outpacing UNH’s 12.6%. Growing memberships in ELV’s Dental, Vision, Medicare Advantage and individual commercial plans should sustain this momentum.

ELV is also contending with elevated medical cost trends, particularly in the ACA and Medicaid segments. This has led to an earnings miss in the second quarter of 2025, with the benefit expense ratio increasing to 88.9% from the 2024-end level of 88.5%, suggesting that a large chunk of premium revenue is going toward claims rather than profitability. For the full year, the metric is expected to hit 90%.

Elevance Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Elevance Health, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Elevance Health, Inc. Quote

By contrast, UNH’s medical care ratio increased to 89.4% in the second quarter from 85.5% in 2024. We expect the metric to average at 89.4% in 2025, signalling relatively strongerprofitability.

Elevance’s return on capital of 10.4% is below the industry average of 12.2% and UNH’s 13%. Both companies have taken shareholder-value boosting moves. In the first half of 2025, ELV returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while UNH returned $9.5 billion. ELV’s dividend yield of 2.21% is lower than that of UNH’s 2.95%.

Nevertheless, Elevance’s Carelon segment, which integrates physical, behavioral and social care, is growing rapidly, providing diversification benefits. Recent buyouts in home health and pharmacy services, higher CarelonRx product revenues and the scaling of innovative risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services are major positives.

How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for UNH & ELV?

Both companies are contending with unfavorable estimates from analysts for 2025 earnings due to the rising costs trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s 2025 and 2026 EPS is pegged at $16.58 and $18.08, indicating a year-over-year decline of 40.1% and growth of 9%, respectively.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Meanwhile, the same for ELV is pegged at $30.15 and $32.19 for 2025 and 2026, signaling an 8.8% decline and 6.8% growth, respectively. All these estimates remained stable over the past week.

Valuation: UNH vs. ELV

Coming to the valuation story, it seems that investors are willing to pay a premium for UnitedHealth compared to Elevance. This is reflected in UNH’s forward 12-month price/earnings (P/E) of 17.23X compared with ELV’s 9.72X. Both are currently trading below their five-year median P/E value.

Bottom Line

UnitedHealth and Elevance both face steep challenges as rising medical costs, regulatory hurdles and shaken investor sentiment weigh on the entire sector. Yet, UnitedHealth has the edge thanks to its unmatched scale, diversified Optum platform, and stronger balance sheet, which provide multiple levers to manage cost pressures and sustain growth. The Amedisys acquisition further deepens its integrated care model, and Buffett’s sizable stake underscores confidence in its long-term resilience.

Elevance, while benefiting from Carelon’s digital push and strong premium growth, still lags in profitability, debt metrics, capital efficiency and shareholder payouts. Ultimately, even though both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), UnitedHealth appears better positioned to restore confidence as the headwinds ease.

While Amazon has “thousands of fresh grocery items” available under the new service, according to its announcement last week, the standard American supermarket stocks an average of 31,795 items, the report said, citing the Food Industry Association.
“Instacart has the whole grocery store available in relatively fast delivery windows,” Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani said.
The WSJ added that Amazon’s new service will likely appeal to Prime members searching for midweek “top up” orders of commonly used products, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz.
Another challenge facing Amazon, per the WSJ: an expanded selection will mean more infrastructure to help keep perishable food fresh.","The company said it would now offer perishable groceries in 1,000 U.S. cities, with plans to more than double that number by year-end, while also lowering the price threshold for free deliveries for Prime members.

But as The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) argues in a report Thursday (Aug. 21), these moves don’t necessarily mean Amazon has the grocery sector sewn up.

Third-party rivals like DoorDash and Amazon, that report said, have strengths of their own: full inventory from a range of local stores, plus a network of drivers that can have orders to customer doorsteps in an hour or less.

Product selection will help too, the WSJ added. While Amazon has “thousands of fresh grocery items” available under the new service, according to its announcement last week, the standard American supermarket stocks an average of 31,795 items, the report said, citing the Food Industry Association.

“Instacart has the whole grocery store available in relatively fast delivery windows,” Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani said.

As PYMNTS wrote earlier this week, Instacart “is countering with a new ad campaign that will keep its awareness level high, but it remains to be seen how much Amazon will take a bite from its business.”

The grocery delivery provider is also expanding its Carrot Ads retail media platform via a partnership with Bottlecapps, a white-label eCommerce provider for more than 1,300 alcohol retailers in the U.S. and Canada. The arrangement will let Bottlecapps retailers use Instacart’s advertising technology and ad inventory to attract alcohol brand campaigns and provide customers with personalized product recommendations.

The WSJ added that Amazon’s new service will likely appeal to Prime members searching for midweek “top up” orders of commonly used products, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz.

In a report last week, Horowitz estimated that if 5% to 10% of American Prime subscribers use the service on a bi-weekly basis at an average order size of $45, that could help Amazon’s revenues grow by as much as 3%.

These days, Starbucks is brewing more than coffee. It’s leaning into wellness, with its latest focus on hydration.

The coffee giant is expanding a test of coconut water–based drinks to more than 400 coffee shops in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and several Midwest cities, part of a broader health-conscious push that over the past year has included removing the extra charge for non-dairy milk customizations, cutting sugar from its matcha powder and launching two zero-sugar ready-to-drink options.

Those changes have already paid off: after axing sugar from its matcha powder, Starbucks reported sales of matcha beverages jumping nearly 40 percent, a sign that customers are embracing healthier choices.

To meet the growing demand, the new Coco Matcha and Coco Cold Brew combine coconut water with either unsweetened matcha cold foam or cold brew foam, creating lower-calorie, lower-sugar alternatives to traditional coffeehouse drinks. A grande Coco Matcha has 230 calories and 11 grams of sugar, while the Coco Cold Brew comes in at 70 calories and 9 grams.

The beverages were first tested in New York this summer through Starbucks’ “Starting 5” program, which pilots new ideas in five coffee shops to gather feedback from customers and baristas before a wider rollout.

“The regional test will allow us to continue testing the beverages and gathering feedback from customers and partners (employees),” Starbucks said on its website. “We look forward to learning from our customers and partners on this test and don’t have additional details to share on the future expansion of the products.”

Starbucks’ wellness push has also drawn attention from Washington. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on X earlier this summer that he met with Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who outlined the company’s plans to “further MAHA its menu,” a nod to President Trump’s “Make America Healthy Again” platform.

“I was pleased to learn that Starbucks’ food and beverages already avoid artificial dyes, artificial flavors, high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners and other additives,” Kennedy wrote.

While Starbucks remains mum for now on whether the coconut water drinks will expand nationally, the company said it plans to launch new protein cold foams in the fall.

Notably, the push into wellness isn’t limited to what’s in the cup. Starbucks is also returning to its cozy roots and the social side of health. The company plans to renovate 1,000 U.S. stores over the next year with cushioned chairs, couches, tables and power outlets, part of Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy to reestablish its shops as a “third place” where customers can linger between home and work or gather at a time when community is increasingly seen as part of overall well-being.",https://athletechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Coconut-Water-Beverage-Test-e1755795037838.webp,N,,2025-08-21 16:13:22.652366

This Week on Free Media What a treat: We filmed two episodes of Free Media—one with Amber Duke and another with Niall Stanage!","Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has been busy lately, and she's receiving plenty of media coverage as a result: Her new Russiagate disclosures shed light on shady behavior from intelligence officials in the final days of Barack Obama's presidency, which had the effect of casting some doubt on the legitimacy of Donald Trump's 2016 victory. The details are a bit complicated, but essentially, national security experts knew that Russia had not hacked U.S. voting machines, and thus the impact of Russian interference on the 2016 result was negligible. Obama was not entirely satisfied with this conclusion and told them to take another crack at it. Shortly thereafter, news stories in the mainstream media began to allege sinister Russian involvement in the election outcome, sourced to anonymous intelligence officials.

Over time, these anonymously sourced and often unspecific claims about direct Russian interference mutated into the social media influence conspiracy, which held that Russian bots and accounts on Facebook had swung the election to Trump. This theory was enthusiastically embraced by intelligence officials and gullible mainstream media reporters; it too eventually died, once the limited scope of the social media influence became clearer.

More transparency around this subject—which generates wall-to-wall coverage in conservative media—is certainly welcome. Gabbard's efforts to further unmask efforts by federal bureaucrats to redact intelligence relating to COVID-19's origins is also welcome. I interviewed The Daily Caller's Emily Kopp about this today on Rising.

These two stories are getting all the attention, but there's something else Gabbard pulled off this week that deserves praise: She has allegedly persuaded the United Kingdom to drop its backdoor encryption mandate for Apple's iPhone.

This is a huge deal, and also a harbinger of diplomatic battles to come.

For context, the U.K. wanted Apple to agree to add what's called a ""backdoor"" that would allow the government to access customers' personal data. Defenders of such policies point to ticking-time-bomb scenarios, i.e., What if the police needed to break into your laptop in order to foil a terrorist attack? and similar situations. The arguments against the backdoor, of course, are obvious: The government can't really be trusted to only access people's personal information under such circumstances; people who live in free societies have to come to regret surrendering their civil liberties in exchange for nebulous safety guarantees; malicious foreign actors, terrorists, and authoritarians could actually benefit from the existence of backdoors, if they were able to hack them.

On this last point, Reason's Joe Lancaster reminds us that ""there is no way to introduce an intentional flaw to data encryption that cannot be exploited by bad actors."" In an article on the backdoor encryption fight, he points out that the U.K. is effectively asking Apple to ""build an unbreakable lock and give law enforcement a key.""

This is not good at all, so it's a relief that Gabbard was able to get the U.K. to back down. Credit where credit is due: Sen. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.), one of the most consistent defenders of privacy and free speech when it comes to tech issues, also pressed for this outcome, as did Vice President J.D. Vance, who has frequently called out European politicians for trying to browbeat American tech companies into adopting un-American policies.

And that is very much where the tech sector is headed. Already, several European countries have launched an age-verification app in anticipation of European Union regulations that will require users to verify their age. The intentions are noble; no one wants underage kids accessing porn sites or harmful content. It's impossible, though, to have an age-verification requirement that only applies to kids—by its very nature, age verification is something everyone will have to submit to in order for it to work at all. This will effectively de-anonymize the internet, as well as create more opportunities for government collection of personal data.

And while Europe is leading the way in terms of bad tech policies that will compromise the user experience, thwart privacy protections, and empower censors, many U.S. political figures are just as bad. State authorities like Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill (R) are fighting tooth and nail to punish tech companies for failing to implement age verification. Domestically, the GOP's reflexive won't someone think of the children style of governance is going to lead it to embrace antitech policies that are clearly recognized as backward and hostile to the First Amendment when pushed by European counterparts.

In any case, fending off international bureaucrats who want to bully American tech companies into making their products worse is a good use of U.S. diplomatic might, though the war at home will be equally vexing for fans of tech freedom in the future.

The statement provides additional clarity and detail surrounding the terms U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen shared following negotiations in Scotland on July 27, including a 15% tariff on EU imports by the U.S. The two trading partners will “promptly document” the agreement, per the statement.

Under the agreement, the U.S. committed to apply either a tariff of 15% or a most favored nation duty rate on EU imports, with the higher of the two to be enforced. The U.S. will set a cap of 15% on tariffs for imports of pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber, per the statement. Those sectors are currently under Section 232 investigation. Similar probes have led to sector-specific tariffs of up to 50%.

The U.S. also plans to apply only the most favored nation rate set by the World Trade Organization to aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals, chemical precursors and “unavailable natural resources,” effective Sept. 1. The two trading partners will “consider other sectors” to add to that group.

Meanwhile, the EU said it intends to eliminate tariffs on U.S. industrial products and provide preferential market access to a range of U.S. food exports, including tree nuts, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, pork and bison meat, and dairy products.

Once the bloc formally introduces legislation to enact these measures, the U.S. plans to apply a tariff of 15% on EU cars and auto parts, unless the covered goods are subject to a higher most favored nation duty rate. The two countries also intend to cooperate on automobile standards.

“These tariff reductions are expected to be effective from the first day of the same month in which the European Union’s legislative proposal is introduced,” according to the statement.

For steel and aluminum imports, the two trading partners said they would “consider the possibility” of cooperating on ring-fencing their domestic markets to protect against overcapacity.

As part of the agreement, the EU expects to procure $750 billion in energy products through 2028 and $40 billion worth of artificial intelligence chips from the U.S. EU companies would also invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next three years.

Manufacturing output sank at a faster pace over the month as the sector’s PMI reading went down to 47.3 from 48 over the same period. Factories reported the largest drop in new orders since April amid sluggish demand caused by President Trump’s tariffs.

The pound strengthened by 0.14 per cent against the dollar to buy $1.34 after the PMI was released. The FTSE 100 dropped by 0.18 per cent.

The S&P Global figures indicated that the UK economy’s growth momentum picked up over the summer after data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that GDP expanded by 0.3 per cent in the three months to June. The economy also grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.

A string of poor data has underscored the challenging economic conditions facing the chancellor as she prepares the autumn budget. The ONS said this week that inflation jumped to 3.8 per cent in July, the highest level since January last year and up from 3.6 per cent.

The Bank of England has warned that it will reach 4 per cent in September, with food inflation on track to peak at 5.5 per cent, partly driven by supermarkets passing on the £25 billion rise in employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs). The Bank cut rates to 4 per cent this month.

S&P Global said that employment across the private sector continued to decline at an “aggressive” pace, which was attributed to rising costs stemming from the NICs rise and the 6.7 per cent increase to the minimum wage in April.

Since the NICs rise was announced by Reeves at the October budget, the PMI has consistently flagged that the labour market was undergoing its worst recession since the global financial crisis.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Payroll numbers also continue to be cut at an aggressive rate by historical standards as firms cite weak order books and concerns over rising staff costs due to the policies announced in the autumn budget.”

Analysts have cast doubt on the validity of these warnings. Bruna Skarica, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said that the market viewed these findings “simply taken as wrong” but noted that they did chime with government data that has signalled a sustained drop in payroll staff.

Separate data revealed that the eurozone private sector economy also picked up momentum in August, aided by a series of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank over the past year.

The composite eurozone PMI jumped to 51.1 in August from 50.9 in July, the highest reading in 15 months.

Bert Colijn, an economist at ING, said: “The PMI paints a picture of an economy not suffering too much from the trade war at this point.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F153305cb-f74b-4c69-822c-f52aa1669581.jpg?crop=7253%2C4080%2C0%2C378&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-21 15:13:27.049934

On top of that, the market is showing a clear divide: flashy Illustration Rares like Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Terapagos ex are slipping, while useful cards like Hyper Rare Darkness Energy, Dusclops, and Okidogi ex are climbing steadily.

Black Bolt is 25% cheaper at $84, White Flare is 17% below Amazon at $80.95 followed by Destined Rivals 17% cheaper at $94.48 and Twilight Masquerade at $86.87, which is a modest 6% cheaper.

Japan's Mega Brave and Mega Symphonia Pokémon TCG sets have quickly gained popularity with collectors and competitive players alike, thanks to their focus on iconic Mega Evolutions, powerful Supporter cards, and premium artwork. High-value chase cards like Mega Gardevoir ex 092/063 and Mega Lucario ex 092/063 are priced at $664 and $444 respectively, while many others remain above the $100 mark.

These sets combine strong gameplay mechanics such as Psychic energy acceleration and hard-hitting Fighting-type attacks with visually stunning Special and Ultra Rare treatments that elevate their appeal. Booster boxes and Premium Trainer Boxes are available on TCGPlayer and include guaranteed rare pulls due to Japanese packaging rules. While the most expensive cards draw attention, more affordable options like Lillie’s Determination 086/063, Mega Kangaskhan ex SAR, and Mega Absol ex SAR offer great value with solid gameplay and collector-friendly art, making these sets a standout release for fans looking for both playability and display-worthy cards.

Stellar Crown’s Illustration Rares like Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Terapagos ex are dropping fast, with nostalgia-driven hype fading as supply grows and competitive players move on. Squirtle is down about 32% since February and Bulbasaur is down 31%, both sliding because their gameplay value is minimal. Earthen Vessel and the Special Illustration Rare Fezandipiti ex are also slipping, while Terapagos ex has been hit hardest, losing over half its value.

On the other hand, Shrouded Fable cards with practical utility are steadily climbing. Hyper Rare Basic Darkness Energy has gained around 17% as Dark-focused decks get more popular, and Dusclops is creeping up thanks to its creative ability. Even the Double Rare Fezandipiti ex is bucking the trend, nearly doubling in value as competitive players embrace it. Smaller gains from Powerglass and Okidogi ex reinforce the idea that functional, playable cards are holding their ground while flashy artwork is losing steam.

Amazon has dropped the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Commander Deck bundle to $189.99 (29% off MSRP), the lowest price yet and a significant saving over buying the decks individually. The set includes all four precons: Revival Trance, Scions and Spellcraft, Limit Break, and Counter Blitz. Limit Break offers strong reprints such as Darksteel Plate and Sword of the Animist, while Counter Blitz delivers powerful synergies built around counters and proliferate. Individually, three of these decks have been selling above $50, with Limit Break still listed at $72.50 on Amazon, making the bundle the best way to grab the full set at a discount.

Amazon has dropped one of the best Magic: The Gathering deals of the year, slashing the price of the Aetherdrift Finish Line Bundle from $79.99 to its lowest-ever $52.70.

With stock already more than halfway claimed, this deal won’t last long.

Best Buy and Amazon have posted its listings for Magic: The Gathering – Avatar: The Last Airbender,

The crossover Universes Beyond set officially launches November 21, 2025 (digital release November 18) and introduces bending-themed mechanics such as airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and firebending, along with fan-favorite characters including Aang, Katara, Zuko, Toph, and even the Cabbage Merchant.

Best Buy will offer multiple products at launch, including the $41.99 Scene Box, $189.99 Play Booster Box, $69.99 Play Booster Bundle, and $109.99 Commander’s Bundle. With full art treatments, collectible foils, and Standard-legal cards, this release is already shaping up to be one of the most anticipated MTG tie-ins of the year.

I'm expecting this MTG Universes Beyond expansion to web zip off shelves when it drops at the end of Feburary, so if you see a preorder like I have, just secure it.

The money won't be taken from your bank until it ships either, so it's a no brainer. I've also included the listings for the rest of the set from TCGPlayer incase you needed a massive ripping session.

Plenty of awesome figures to choose from here for more than 50% off in most cases. I absolutley love the comic front cover diorama ones, fantastic display pieces and belong on everyone's show-off shelf for these kinds of prices.

We're not just talk about bricks here, we've even got a cracking deal for a physical copy of LEGO Horizon Adventures on PS5 for $21.99, a massive 63% off.

How we choose the best Labor Day deals

At CNET, we've got a team of expert shoppers and deal-hunters whose experience spans years of helping buyers understand which major sales and deals are legitimately good and which are more routine. That includes Black Friday, Prime Day, Fourth of July and countless other shopping events. We've gotten very good at weeding out scams and superficial deals. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.

Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for all items sold at Best Buy to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.

Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.

Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed.

Verdict: Is the Nike Vomero 18 Worth It If you’re on the hunt for a good, fun, very bouncy easy run shoe, this ticks the boxes.","Nike’s history in the running world is hard to match, with probably more iconic running shoes, marathon PB results, and diehard fans than any other running brand in the world. It all started in 1972 with the brand’s launch of their now-dubbed “moon shoe,” which was then followed by the similarly bizarrely named “waffle racer.” Jogging itself even took off thanks to marketing campaigns Olympic coach Bill Bowerman ran with Nike—lo and behold, running and Nike have grown synonymous ever since. These days, the hype is mostly dominated by the Pegasus, Vaporflys and Alphaflys, but the Vomero 18 is slowly creeping its way up the rankings.

As much as delving deep into the history of Nike’s running shoes could seem slightly tangential, it gives important context for where the new Vomero 18—the subject of our current running obsession—fits into the running world. The Vomero 18 came along this year and, somehow, has managed to capture attention in a way that few Nike shoes have been able to (beyond the company's hero products, of course). It’s been heralded across TikTok and running influencer channels as the running shoe of 2025. Curious, we had to put it to the test ourselves.

Cushioning for Days

Technically, the Nike Vomero feels more like something you’d find at the likes of New Balance than what we expected from Nike. It’s ultra-cushioned, with ZoomX foam (the brand’s own lightweight foam) stacked above ReactX foam (a more responsive foam) to create a really bouncy feel. If you imagine the sensation of being somewhat on springs, that’s really the best way to describe it. Each step is softened, but without your energy feeling like it's totally been zapped away.

Having worn them ourselves now across 5K and 10K runs, as well as at the track, we can confirm that it doesn't feel at all like a speed shoe. This is very much an easy, long-run shoe that has good support and cushioning, rather than a shoe would want to ramp up the pace in. The weight comes in at 11.5 ounces, which is significantly heavier than some of our other easy run shoes (the Asics Novablast, for example, come in at 9 ounces while the Saucony Triumph 22—a shoe we already found quite heavy—is 10 ounces). In general, though, this isn’t super noticeable over shorter distances, and the extra cushioning and support meant we felt less ruined after longer runs, making it a price worth paying.

What Are Those?!

Running used to be a sport that revolved around jogging in your oldest t-shirt, a pair of shorts you wore for PE at school, and whatever pair of shoes you had been using for the 10 years prior. Now, thanks to influencers and the growth of the sport as a whole, it’s become almost its own fashion game. And with it, Nike’s passion for reinventing neon shoe designs has become even more in demand.

The Vomero 18’s initial release colorway was exactly the vibe of the moment; neon pink with a lighter neon pink fabric and a splash of orange throughout. This has since been followed by some more classic Nike styles, the full black (which is now almost sold out) and the black and white, with an orange, black and red, and neon and blue also available. It’s one of the best-looking shoes of 2025, hands down, and feels like a major upgrade from the Invincibles Nike launched the year prior.

The only downside? After wearing them on only three runs in quite dry summer weather, we’d already seen a lot of dust accumulate on the shoes. British parks definitely cause this around this time of year, but it felt like the shoes just showed the dirt more than some others in our kit. It's not a huge failing, but it does mean you need to be prepared to get scrubbing every now and again to maintain that box-fresh look.

Verdict: Is the Nike Vomero 18 Worth It

If you’re on the hunt for a good, fun, very bouncy easy run shoe, this ticks the boxes. It might look a bit dirty after a few runs, and it has a bit of extra weight to it, but the sheer amount of cushioning and support makes it feel like one of the springiest rides we’ve tried this year. It’s smooth, should last for a good couple hundred miles and generally makes us feel less susceptible to the aches and pains of running. Nike's done it again, folks.","https://media.gq.com/photos/68a7573afca9ddd58aa9722e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nikelede0821.png",N,,2025-08-21 15:12:58.794929

10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›

The stock market remains on an upward trajectory, and the major market indexes are at all-time highs as investors continue piling into the leading technology companies. What's the cause? Look no further than artificial intelligence (AI). Companies are pouring billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, laying the groundwork for what experts believe will be a multitrillion-dollar AI industry down the road.

It's important to avoid getting carried away. Remember, valuations always matter.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Try to keep that in mind when looking at the best AI stocks to buy today. Here are three AI leaders that happen to still trade at attractive prices, making them table-pounding buys to consider right now.

1. Advanced Micro Devices

Chips have arguably been the hottest growth trend within AI over the past couple of years. Massive clusters of chips, housed in data centers, are generating the computing power to train and run increasingly intelligent AI models. Nvidia has ruled this market thus far, but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), or AMD, could soon push for more market share. The companies spending billions of dollars on AI need to show a sufficient return to justify such expensive investments.

AMD is showing a path to cost savings that is enticing customers. For instance, AMD claims its Instinct MI355X chip produces up to 40% more tokens (AI output) per dollar than Nvidia's equivalent. AMD CEO Lisa Su indicated during the company's Q2earnings callthat seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies are using its Instinct chips. The upcoming MI400 will reportedly produce more than twice the compute and nearly two and a half times the bandwidth as the current generation, a massive leap in performance that could attract more dollars from these key customers.

AMD's stock currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of just under 10, a third of the valuation Nvidia trades at. Nvidia has undoubtedly earned its premium to this point, but AMD could be a winning stock moving forward if the company can successfully peel off market share. Analysts have estimated Nvidia's data center dominance as high as 92% of the market, and holding onto all of that business could prove a tall task.

2. ASML

As chips become increasingly complex, so do the tools needed to build them. ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) designs and produces specialized equipment systems, called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light lithography machines, that use light to print microscopic patterns on silicon wafers. It's crucial to building high-end chips, like those used in AI data centers, and ASML is the world's only company that creates these systems.

Yet, ASML's stock has tumbled and currently sits over 30% off its all-time high. Unfortunately, the Dutch company has gotten caught in geopolitical and tariff tensions that management warned could weigh on ASML's business in 2026. It's not ideal, but the adversity may have created a buying opportunity. AI chip companies have multiyear roadmaps in place, and the foundries that manufacture these chips will continue to need ASML's cutting-edge machinery over the coming years.

Wall Street analysts have lowered their long-term expectations for ASML due to the current headwinds, yet still peg long-term annualized earnings growth at over 16%. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio (28) is still very fair for that growth, and would look like a bargain in hindsight if these storm clouds part and ASML outperforms expectations over the coming years. The company's monopoly on these crucial EUV lithography machines may warrant investors taking a leap of faith in an otherwise excellent company.

3. Alphabet

Search engine giant and Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has faced some doubts after the U.S. government came after its core search engine business, and the explosive popularity of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots has raised questions about whether people will still use Google Search years from now. So far, it seems that Alphabet is rising to the occasion.

Time will tell whether the company faces any severe outcomes from its antitrust litigation, but what's clear thus far is that Google Search is still doing just fine. The business unit's revenue rose 12% year over year in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the company's other segments are thriving on AI momentum, including Google Cloud revenue surging 32%, and its autonomous ride-hailing business, Waymo, continuing to expand across the United States.

Alphabet remains a multifaceted play on AI and other technology trends. The stock has recently bounced back to near new highs, but I would argue that it remains a compelling buy today. Shares trade at a P/E ratio of less than 22, a fantastic valuation for a business that analysts anticipate growing earnings at an annualized rate of almost 15% moving forward.

Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:

The U.S. company founded in 2009 has reached an agreement with its shareholders to reduce part of the liabilities that the company is carrying. Specifically, the exchange involves handing over the majority of the company’s capital in exchange for $240 million of its debt.

“This recapitalization is intended to improve the company’s balance sheet and financial flexibility through a significant reduction in debt and interest expense, while achieving a favorable extension of the maturity of the remaining debt,“ Rent The Runway explained in a statement.

The transaction has been structured in two different ways. On the one hand, the investment fund Aranda Principal Strategies will convert $100 million of its initial debt investment into an equity stake, which, based on the value of Rent The Runway’s shares, translates into $240 million.

Rent The Runway must repay before 2029 another $120 million of debt

In parallel, Aranda Principal Strategies, Nexus and Story3, also investment funds, will inject another $20 million in the company’s capital, in exchange for their participation. This also means the entry of both funds in the management committee of the U.S. company.

Once the deal closes, between the three funds they will control 86% of Rent The Runway, while the company’s liabilities will have been reduced to $120 million, with a new term extended to 2029. The company will, however, give existing shareholders the ability to purchase up to $12.5 million in shares.

For its last full fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, the company posted revenue of $264.9 million, down 1.5% from the previous fiscal year. Although Rent The Runway remained in the red, it also managed to reduce its loss by more than 18% to $113.2 million.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Play on Healthcare Innovation FluMist Home exemplifies the intersection of strategic innovation and financial scalability.
Conclusion: A Catalyst for DTC Healthcare's Future AstraZeneca's FluMist Home is more than a product—it is a paradigm shift in how preventive care is delivered.","The direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical sector is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and the urgent need for accessible preventive care. At the forefront of this transformation is AstraZeneca's FluMist® Home, a groundbreaking at-home flu vaccine delivery service launched in September 2025. Partnering with Polaris Pharmacy Services and ASPN Pharmacies, AstraZeneca has redefined vaccine accessibility by eliminating traditional barriers such as clinic visits, needle phobia, and logistical constraints. For investors, FluMist Home represents not just a product but a strategic pivot toward a $150 billion specialty pharmacy services market projected to grow at 12% annually.

Strategic Innovation: Redefining Vaccine Accessibility

FluMist Home's core innovation lies in its ability to bypass intermediaries while maintaining regulatory compliance. By integrating telehealth screenings, temperature-controlled logistics, and user-friendly administration, the service targets underserved demographics—busy parents, needle-averse individuals, and those in rural or underserved areas. Human factors studies confirm 100% successful self-administration among users aged 18–49, a critical validation for FDA approval and consumer trust. This model aligns with the broader DTC healthcare trend, which has seen a 30% annual growth rate since 2020, as consumers demand asynchronous, on-demand solutions.

The service's scalability is equally compelling. Currently available in 34 U.S. states (covering 80% of the eligible population), FluMist Home aims to expand to all 48 contiguous states by 2026. This geographic expansion, coupled with potential integration into the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, could unlock $2.4 billion in revenue. AstraZeneca's strategic partnerships with Polaris Pharmacy Services and ASPN Pharmacies ensure compliance with FDA and CDC standards, reinforcing the service's credibility and long-term viability.

Financial Implications: A High-Margin Growth Engine

From a financial perspective, FluMist Home is a dual opportunity: immediate revenue generation and long-term market leadership. The service's lean operational model—charging a $8.99 evaluation fee and minimal shipping costs—positions it as a high-margin offering. Analysts estimate that capturing 10% of the $1.2 billion U.S. flu vaccine market could generate $120 million in incremental revenue, with expansion to all 48 states potentially tripling this figure.

AstraZeneca's stock performance underscores investor confidence in this strategy. In Q3 2025, the company's shares rose 12% following the launch of FluMist Home, outpacing the UK Pharmaceuticals industry's 10.3% annual return. The stock's forward P/E ratio of 16.86 suggests undervaluation relative to its earnings potential, with a 18.95% discount to the consensus price target of £137.89. Analysts project revenue growth from $8.3 billion in 2025 to $13.9 billion by 2028, driven by FluMist Home's scalability and AstraZeneca's broader pipeline of DTC innovations.

Risk Mitigation and Competitive Edge

While challenges persist—regulatory hurdles in 14 U.S. states and competition from traditional vaccine providers—AstraZeneca's first-mover advantage and robust partnerships mitigate these risks. The company's tiveTag technology, which ensures cold chain integrity and real-time temperature monitoring, enhances consumer trust and reduces vaccine waste. Additionally, FluMist Home's alignment with public health goals—such as increasing vaccination rates from 46.7% for adults and 49.2% for children—positions it as a socially impactful investment.

For investors, the key lies in recognizing FluMist Home's potential to disrupt not just the flu vaccine market but the broader DTC pharma landscape. The service's success could pave the way for at-home administration of other vaccines, such as RSV or shingles, further expanding AstraZeneca's revenue streams.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Play on Healthcare Innovation

FluMist Home exemplifies the intersection of strategic innovation and financial scalability. For long-term investors, the service offers exposure to a high-growth sector with strong public health implications. AstraZeneca's 54.08% total shareholder returns over five years and its $80 billion 2030 revenue ambition underscore its commitment to innovation-driven growth.

However, investors should monitor regulatory developments and adoption rates in the 2025–2026 flu season. Early indicators—such as the 12% stock price increase post-launch and positive Phase IV study projections—suggest strong market acceptance. Given the global vaccines market's projected growth to $118 billion by 2030, FluMist Home is poised to become a cornerstone of AstraZeneca's portfolio.

Conclusion: A Catalyst for DTC Healthcare's Future

AstraZeneca's FluMist Home is more than a product—it is a paradigm shift in how preventive care is delivered. By addressing logistical and behavioral barriers to vaccination, the service aligns with consumer demand for convenience and autonomy. For investors, this represents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on a high-margin, scalable innovation with long-term public health and financial returns. As the DTC pharma sector continues to evolve, FluMist Home stands as a testament to the power of disruptive thinking in redefining healthcare access.

In a market where convenience and innovation reign supreme, FluMist Home is not just a winner—it is a harbinger of the future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-21 15:13:11.278172

Moukawsher, John Davenport",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/us-bankruptcies-highest-level-since-covid-2116819,"So far in 2025, meanwhile, the total of 446 bankruptcy filings is the highest for this seven-month stretch since 2010.
With 446 bankruptcies recorded within the first seven months, 2025 is on track to surpass 2024's full-year total of 688.
Newsweek has contacted S&P Global via email for clarification on its methodology.
Lawless added that the report avoids a crucial issue by tracking bankruptcy filings rather than the number of entities filing for bankruptcy, as others have done recently.
Earlier this month, bankruptcy information services platform Epiq AACER reported that commercial bankruptcy filings had jumped 78 percent year-over-year to 911 in July.","The U.S. saw a sharp increase in corporate bankruptcy filings in July, according to a recent report, reaching a post-COVID peak and placing 2025 on track to surpass last year's total.

S&P Global Market Intelligence, the research and data arm of the credit-rating agency, found that filings by large public and private companies rose to 71 last month from 66 in June, marking the highest monthly tally since July 2020. So far in 2025, meanwhile, the total of 446 bankruptcy filings is the highest for this seven-month stretch since 2010.

Why It Matters

Experts told Newsweek that, when factoring in things like currency depreciation and corporate structures, statistics such as these are less alarming than they may initially appear. However, the notable increase in both business and personal bankruptcies in recent months has exacerbated existing concerns about the overall health of the U.S. economy.

In its report, S&P Global cited the impact of high interest rates and ""uncertainty"" created by tariffs; but the economy is also grappling with elevated inflation, a precarious labor market and other headwinds that have prompted some economists to warn of an impending recession.

What To Know

Through the first seven months of the year, bankruptcies were heavily concentrated in the industrial and consumer discretionary sectors, totaling 70 and 61, respectively.

Among high-profile bankruptcies, S&P Global noted three that had over $1 billion in assets and liabilities at the time of their July filings: Glucose-monitoring company LifeScan Global; canned goods company Del Monte Foods; and Genesis Healthcare, the Pennsylvania-headquartered nursing home and long-term care provider.

With 446 bankruptcies recorded within the first seven months, 2025 is on track to surpass 2024's full-year total of 688. This compares to 634 in 2023, 373 in 2022, 405 in 2021 and 638 in 2020.

For its tracking purposes, S&P Global defined ""large"" firms as public companies with at least $2 million in assets or liabilities, and private companies with at least $10 million at the time of the bankruptcy filings.

However, Robert Lawless, a professor of law at the University of Illinois and co-author of Debt's Grip: Risk and Consumer Bankruptcy, said that this benchmark may result in comparisons that are not quite ""apples-to-apples.""

""A dollar has lost 19 percent of its value since December 2020,"" he told Newsweek. ""Similarly, a $2 million bankruptcy today is the same as approximately a $1.4 million bankruptcy in 2010.""

""Inflation over time will make it seem like there are more 'big' bankruptcies if an adjustment is not made,"" Lawless said.

Newsweek has contacted S&P Global via email for clarification on its methodology.

Lawless added that the report avoids a crucial issue by tracking bankruptcy filings rather than the number of entities filing for bankruptcy, as others have done recently.

Earlier this month, bankruptcy information services platform Epiq AACER reported that commercial bankruptcy filings had jumped 78 percent year-over-year to 911 in July. However, as Lawless noted in a blog post, nearly a third of these filings were the result of the Genesis Healthcare bankruptcy.

""The narrative focused on the number of entities filing for bankruptcy is not quite right,"" Melissa Jacoby, a law professor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Newsweek.

""Many of those separate corporate entities are part of a common corporate group—companies partition themselves into separate business associations under state law, but they typically are an integrated whole in terms of thinking about a bankrupt business and are managed together in the bankruptcy process,"" she said.

What People Are Saying

S&P Global, in the report, wrote: ""Companies are contending with elevated interest rates as uncertainty from U.S. tariff policy pressures costs and supply chain resilience.""

""Companies could benefit from the [Federal Reserve] rate cut if such a move impacts U.S. Treasury yields or market sentiment,"" it said, adding that: ""Treasury yields influence corporate debt interest rates more directly than the Fed rate.""

Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi, said earlier this month: ""It's no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households.""

What Happens Next?

Despite rising bankruptcies, other signs point to resilience among large U.S. corporations. According to recent analysis by Goldman Sachs strategists, cited in Bloomberg, aggregate second-quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 companies are up 11 percent compared to last year, surpassing previous forecasts of a 4 percent gain.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2706701/wall-street.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 14:16:14.650307

Agricultural products companies could see earnings recovery with finalized U.S. biofuels regulations.

JPMorgan Upgrades Upstart Holdings Inc. (UPST)

Investment bank JPMorgan has upgraded its rating on Upstart Holdings Inc. (UPST) from Neutral to Overweight, despite reducing its price target from $93.00 to $88.00. The move comes despite Upstart shares underperforming year to date, declining approximately 20% since the second-quarter results were reported. JPMorgan attributes this decline to concerns around balance sheet growth and a new convertible issuance. The stock currently trades at $61.59, with a 53.6% revenue growth over the last twelve months [1].

The upgrade reflects JPMorgan's positive outlook on more seasoned fintech lenders, with the bank noting that loan buyer demand for Upstart remains strong. Street estimates for 2026 revenue and adjusted EBITDA have increased significantly, up 37% and 87% respectively, indicating underlying business strength despite share price weakness. The firm's $88 December 2026 price target represents approximately 35% upside from current levels and applies a 6.5x price-to-sales multiple to its 2027 estimates [1].

JPMorgan has assumed coverage of Campbell's Soup Company (CPB) with a Neutral rating and a price target of $33, down from $34. The firm highlighted McCormick (MKC), Albertsons (ACI), Hormel Foods (HRL), and J.M. Smucker (SJM) as top picks, while cautioning on Beyond Meat (BYND) and General Mills (GIS). Food producers are dealing with pressure from slower center store category growth and market share losses, while food retailers should benefit from the continued inflationary environment. Agricultural products companies could be past the worst of their earnings pressures, but an earnings recovery hinges on finalized U.S. biofuels regulations [3].

Analysts' Views on Hormel Foods

In a separate report, Bank of America Securities maintained a Hold rating on Hormel Foods (HRL) with a price target of $35.00. The company's shares closed yesterday at $28.28. The Street consensus suggests a Moderate Buy rating for Hormel Foods with an average price target of $32.83, indicating a 16.09% upside from current levels [2].

According to recent data from LSEG IBES, forward 12-month earnings estimates for large and mid-cap firms in India have been cut by 1.2% in the past two weeks, marking the sharpest decline in Asia. This trend followed weak earnings reports for the April-June quarter and has contributed to a downward re-rating of Indian equities. Analysts point to the steep U.S. tariffs, which have been raised to as high as 50% on Indian imports, as a primary cause for the decline in expectations. The economic impact of these tariffs is expected to be significant, with analysis from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group indicating that sustained 50% tariffs could reduce India's GDP growth by 1 percentage point over time. Employment-sensitive sectors like textiles are likely to bear the brunt of these impacts.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded to the trade tensions by announcing comprehensive tax reforms intended to stimulate domestic consumption and boost economic resilience. These reforms include simplifying the goods and services tax (GST) system by introducing a two-tier structure of 5% and 18%, replacing the previous 12% and 28% rates. The government expects these changes to reduce the tax burden on micro, small, and medium enterprises and encourage investment in sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, and consumer goods. According to experts, the reforms could provide a much-needed boost to India's consumption-driven economy, which contributes over 60% of GDP. Standard Chartered economists estimate that the tax changes could add between 0.35 and 0.45 percentage points to India's GDP growth by the fiscal year ending in March 2027.

Despite these efforts, analysts remain cautious about the pace of economic recovery. India's real GDP growth averaged 8.8% annually between fiscal 2022 and 2024, but projections for the next three years suggest a slowdown to 6.8% per year. The impact of the U.S. tariffs is particularly evident in specific industries such as automobiles, capital goods, and consumer durables, where forward earnings estimates have dropped by more than 1%. Bank of America’s latest fund manager survey reflects a significant shift in sentiment, with India's status dropping from the most favored to the least preferred Asian equity market in just two months. J.P. Morgan strategist Raisah Rasid noted that while tariffs are likely to trigger a downward re-rating of valuations, they may also make domestic-oriented stocks more attractive.

The trade dispute with the U.S. has also raised concerns about the broader strategic partnership between the two nations. U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs, particularly the additional 25% on Indian imports related to Russian oil purchases, has intensified diplomatic discussions. While the Indian government has expressed its commitment to protecting national interests, there are growing concerns that the trade tensions could strain other cooperative efforts, including defense and technology collaborations. CFR's Kenneth I. Juster emphasized the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the U.S. and India, noting that both nations have a vested interest in resolving trade disputes to preserve the integrity of their strategic alliance.

Analysts remain divided on the long-term economic implications. While some believe that India’s tax reforms will provide a solid foundation for future growth, others caution that the trade tensions could dampen investor confidence and slow down the recovery of corporate profits. Rajat Agarwal, an Asia equity strategist at Société Générale, pointed out that economic growth and corporate earnings in India have been underperforming in recent quarters, with earnings growth in 2024 reaching only 6%. As the country navigates these challenges, the coming months will be critical in determining whether the current trade tensions will have a lasting impact on India’s economic trajectory.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Shortly after the 2025 IMSA season wraps up on-track, the IMSA Esports Global Championship on iRacing returns for its fourth season with another excellent slate of four races at five different venues.

IMSA once again partners with iRacing, VCO (Virtual Competition Organisation), AMD and Michelin for the season, which features a $25,000 prize pool and will start less than a month after Motul Petit Le Mans closes the curtain on the 2025 season at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta.

“It’s become a new tradition that the best sim racers in the world gather under the IMSA banner after our on-track season concludes,” said Brandon Huddleston, IMSA vice president, partnership marketing and business development. “After three incredible seasons, the fourth IMSA Esports Global Championship should be another excellent, competitive showcase of talent, just like what you see in real life from the IMSA calendar.”

The schedule of events changes slightly from the third season which ran from November 2024 to January 2025, with three of the four venues returning for the fourth season.

IMSA Esports Global Championship races at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta (Round 1), Sebring International Raceway (Round 2) and Daytona International Speedway (Round 4) return for both the Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) and Grand Touring Daytona (GTD) classes. However, two new venues will create a unique calendar twist.

The third round of the season will see GTP cars race the Long Beach Street Circuit while GTD cars head to VIRginia International Raceway. Each will have a 75-minute race and be broadcast back-to-back on the same channel as part of a new-for-2025 split race concept.

Schedule:

Round 1: Sunday, Nov. 2 – Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta (GTP, GTD)

Round 2: Sunday, Nov. 16 – Sebring International Raceway (GTP, GTD)

Round 3: Sunday, Nov. 23 – Long Beach Street Circuit (GTP) and VIR (GTD)

Trade-in deals are an increasingly common way to score a discount on your new smartphone, but they’ve also not really been Google’s strong suit over the years. There are usually a handful of good offers for users switching from other brands or buying through a carrier, but the Google Store, for example, doesn’t always provide the best value.

Case in point is this year’s Pixel 10 series. The Google Store is offering up to $760 in trade-in credits and up to $350 in store credit. It’s a solid deal, but the details do matter. For one, the credit varies by device – $100 with Pixel 10, $200 with Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and $350 with Pixel 10 Pro Fold – while the trade-in values don’t change. Beyond that, the store credit can’t be used on anything beyond other Google devices and accessories, limiting its usefulness.

The credit is matched at other retailers, such as Amazon, where you’ll get a gift card that can be used on basically anything you want.

Best Buy, though, is offering the best of both worlds. The trade-in credits and gift cards match the Google Store, meaning you can not only get a new Pixel at a good price, but you can then use that gift card on a much broader number of items. And, looking at a trade-in of around $500 which you’ll get for select Pixel, Galaxy, and iPhone trades, you can get a Pixel 10 for as low as $199.

So, if you’re a Pixel 9 Pro XL owner looking to upgrade, here are the final costs you’d be looking at:

Pixel 10 $799 – Pixel 9 Pro XL trade of $500 – $100 gift card = $199 (+ tax)

Pixel 10 Pro $999 – Pixel 9 Pro XL trade of $500 – $200 gift card = $299 (+ tax)

Pixel 10 Pro XL $1,199 – Pixel 9 Pro XL trade of $500 – $200 gift card = $499 (+ tax)

Pixel 10 Pro Fold $1,799 – Pixel 9 Pro XL trade of $760 – $350 gift card = $689 (+ tax)

Similarly, if Google has convinced you to jump ship from Apple and you want to move over from your iPhone 14, you’d be looking at the following costs:

Pixel 10 $799 – iPhone 14 trade of $330 – $100 gift card = $369 (+ tax)

• Star Fashion (STFS) slumps 56.07% to $0.1911, hitting its 52-week low of $0.1901

• Intraday range of $0.1901–$0.2574 highlights extreme volatility amid 318.6% turnover surge

• MACD (-0.0099) and RSI (20.94) confirm oversold conditions, while Bollinger Bands signal bearish exhaustion

Star Fashion’s stock has imploded in real-time trading, collapsing 56.07% to $0.1911 as of 3:56 PM EDT. The move, driven by a confluence of technical breakdowns and sector-wide jitters, has left the stock teetering near its 52-week low. With a 318.6% surge in turnover and a -8.7 PE ratio, the market is sounding alarms about liquidity risks and speculative overreach.

Bearish Technicals and Sector-Wide Jitters Ignite Sell-Off

Star Fashion’s freefall is rooted in a perfect storm of technical indicators and sector dynamics. The stock’s RSI (20.94) has plunged into oversold territory, while the MACD (-0.0099) and negative histogram (-0.1395) confirm a deepening bearish momentum. Bollinger Bands (Upper: $2.72, Lower: $1.16) show the price is trading far below the 20-day moving average ($1.94), signaling a breakdown in trendline support. Compounding this, the advertising agencies sector is under pressure, with Omnicom Group (OMC) down 0.13%, reflecting broader macroeconomic anxieties about ad spend during trade war uncertainty.

Advertising Agencies Sector in Retreat as Macro Fears Intensify

The advertising agencies sector is broadly underperforming, with Omnicom Group (OMC) down 0.13% and peers like Publicis Groupe and WPP grappling with macroeconomic headwinds. Star Fashion’s collapse mirrors sector-wide concerns about declining client budgets amid trade war volatility and AI-driven cost-cutting. While OMC’s modest decline suggests a more stable position, STFS’s -56.07% drop highlights its precarious liquidity and speculative exposure.

Bearish Playbook: ETFs and Technicals Signal Short-Side Opportunity

• 200-day MA: $2.75 (far below current price)

• RSI: 20.94 (oversold)

• MACD: -0.0099 (bearish divergence)

• Bollinger Bands: Price at 1.16 (lower band)

• Turnover: 318.6% surge (liquidity risk)

Star Fashion’s technicals scream short-term bearish exhaustion. Key levels to watch include the 200-day MA ($2.75) and the 52-week low ($0.1901). With RSI in oversold territory and MACD diverging sharply, a continuation of the downtrend is likely. However, the absence of options liquidity and leveraged ETF data limits direct hedging. Aggressive short-sellers should target a breakdown below $0.1901, while long-term investors may wait for a potential bounce off the lower Bollinger Band ($1.16).

Backtest Star Fashion Stock Performance

The backtest of STFS's performance after an intraday plunge of at least -56% shows favorable results. The 3-Day win rate is 60.49%, the 10-Day win rate is 69.14%, and the 30-Day win rate is 74.07%. Additionally, the maximum return during the backtest period was 28.68%, which occurred on day 58, indicating that STFS has the potential for recovery following a significant downturn.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-21 14:16:08.612331

Key Takeaways

U.S. equities fell at midday as weekly jobless claims were above expectations and Walmart missed earnings estimates and warned that tariff costs are rising.

Cosmetics giant Coty posted a surprise loss as retailers were cautious about spending.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise was upgraded by Morgan Stanley, and shares rose.

U.S. equities were lower at midday on higher-than-expected initial jobless claims and concerns about retail. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all fell.

Walmart (WMT) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow when the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer missed earnings estimates and warned that tariff costs are rising.

Coty (COTY) shares sank after the cosmetics maker reported an unexpected loss and gave a weak outlook as retailers reduced orders.

Shares of Instacart operator Maplebear (CART) declined on a downgrade from Wedbush, which said increased competition could hurt results.

Nordson (NDSN) shares advanced when the adhesives maker posted better-than-anticipated results and guidance, and announced a $500 million stock buyback plan as sales at its medical and fluid solutions unit soared.

Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) gained on an upgrade by Morgan Stanley. Analysts said they're seeing increased corporate spending on the computer processing hardware firm's artificial intelligence and other products.

A double upgrade from Goldman Sachs boosted shares of real estate investment trust Broadstone Net Lease (BNL). Goldman pointed to the company's development pipeline, which it believes has created a reliable growth in earnings and can reduce the gap in valuations.

Prudential PLC, a significant institutional investor, also recently sold a portion of its stake in CVS Health, retaining 18,165 shares valued at approximately $1.23 million [3]. This move follows several other institutional investors who have added to their positions in the company, highlighting its appeal among investors.

The positive analyst ratings and robust financial performance are not without their caveats. CVS Health's net margin is relatively low at 1.17%, and it experienced a slight decline in earnings per share compared to the same quarter last year [2]. Additionally, insider ownership is only 1.22%, which may suggest a lack of confidence from those closest to the company.

Despite these challenges, CVS Health's strong earnings, revenue growth, and analyst ratings provide a compelling case for investors. The stock's current price of $70.82 is considered attractive given the company's solid fundamentals and growth prospects. With an average price target of $79.88 and a potential upside of 12.80%, investors may find CVS Health an attractive investment opportunity.

Deli: Kirkland Signature Beef Dinner Franks

Costco’s branded dogs are a 1/4 lb each, with a pack totaling almost 4 pounds for 14 links. “We are a very picky family about hot dogs. Generally we ONLY like the old fashioned kind in natural casings. But we all love these hotdogs! Great flavor but not over powering. Perfect blend of seasonings that don’t upset any of our stomachs either. And they are HUGE! I can’t find buns to fit them LOL. But I will still continue to buy them,” writes a shopper. “These are seriously the best hot dogs in the world. We use them as sausages and pizza toppings too. I highly recommend cooking in the air fryer,” adds another.

Deli: Del Real Foods Carnitas

Costco sells lots of gourmet meat at the store, but you can also find great deals on the website. Rastelli’s Antibiotic-free Chicken Breast and Thigh Pack comes with 32 packs or 10 pounds of meat. Get it now for $20 off, bringing the price down to $109.99 until August 17. It’s a “great deal,” one shopper writes. “I like how half this box was thigh meat and half breast meat. All portions are individually wrapped which makes it easy to freeze and retrieve. No bone or fat.”

David’s Cookies Brownie and Cookie Combo Pack comes with 6 Rocky Road Brownies and 12 Chocolate Chunk Cookies for $29.99. “The absolutely to die for Rocky Road Brownie tray (comes in a separate box) barely made it to the freezer. These were better than any of my family secret recipes. Really Great Brownies! The second box had David’s great large chunk chocolate cookies. This box was polished off in one night – never made it to the freezer. Be warned these cookies are so very fresh & delicious – it’s hard to just eat one. Highly Recommend buying these,” writes a shopper.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Bakery: Hostess Cupcakes & Twinkies

Also in the bakery? A 32-pack box of Hostess Cupcakes & Twinkies for $10.99. “Great price and nice to have on hand for snack time.

Over in the breakfast aisle, pick up a fan favorite: Kirkland Signature Organic Ancient Grain Granola, a 35.3-ounce bag of USDA organic granola infused with probiotic cultures, is delicious and great for your gut.

Breakfast: Quaker Oats Old Fashioned Rolled Oats

Costco is the best place to buy oatmeal. Get a 10-pound container of Quaker Oats Old Fashioned Rolled Oats for $8.79. “I have this every morning in the winter with either brown sugar or maple syrup. How i make it is i fill the electric water heater, plug it in and wait seconds for it to heat. (You can get it online at costco.com) i then pour the hot water over the oatmeal, place a lid on oatmeal bowl and let it sit while i drink my coffee. Once i am done with my coffee, the oatmeal is nice and cooled some and ready to be eaten. I found this is the best way to cook it because you are not over cooking it and get more of its nutritional benefits,” one shopper writes.

Drinks: Gatorade

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in Kraft Heinz Co (Symbol: KHC) saw new options become available today, for the October 3rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KHC options chain for the new October 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $25.00 strike price has a current bid of 19 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $25.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $24.81 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KHC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $27.32/share today.

Because the $25.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 74%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.76% return on the cash commitment, or 6.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Kraft Heinz Co, and highlighting in green where the $25.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $29.00 strike price has a current bid of 14 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of KHC stock at the current price level of $27.32/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $29.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.66% if the stock gets called away at the October 3rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KHC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Kraft Heinz Co, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KHC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $29.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $29.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.51% boost of extra return to the investor, or 4.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 42%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $27.32) to be 23%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UPS options chain for the new October 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $79.00 strike price has a current bid of 63 cents.
Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in United Parcel Service Inc (Symbol: UPS) saw new options become available today, for the October 3rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UPS options chain for the new October 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $79.00 strike price has a current bid of 63 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $79.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $78.37 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of UPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $86.53/share today.

Because the $79.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.80% return on the cash commitment, or 6.77% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for United Parcel Service Inc, and highlighting in green where the $79.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $94.00 strike price has a current bid of 65 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of UPS stock at the current price level of $86.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $94.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.38% if the stock gets called away at the October 3rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if UPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for United Parcel Service Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing UPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $94.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $94.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.75% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.38% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 38%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 39%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $86.53) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Analysts point to stablecoin demand for Treasury bills and the tokenization of money market fund shares as two forces increasingly shaping investor behavior.

Stablecoin demand for T-bills

Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, have become an essential part of crypto trading and cross-border payments. BofA expects these issuers to steadily increase their use of short-term U.S. government debt, particularly Treasury bills.

The bank projects stablecoin allocations to T-bills could expand by $25 billion to $75 billion over the next year. While significant in scale, analysts stressed that this level of demand is not large enough to meaningfully shift overall Treasury market dynamics.

Instead, BofA sees stablecoins as posing a greater challenge to money market mutual funds (MMFs), which traditionally capture similar yield-seeking flows. Because stablecoins cannot currently pay interest, MMFs maintain an edge – but one that may narrow if regulatory changes or creative workarounds allow stablecoins to distribute yield.

Tokenization as a defensive strategy

The report also notes a growing interest in tokenization among MMF providers, with some viewing it as a way to defend against stablecoin competition. In July 2025, BNY Mellon and Goldman Sachs jointly launched blockchain-based technology to record ownership of select MMF shares.

That effort represented the first rollover of tokenized MMF shares, a milestone that aligns with broader industry momentum following the passage of the GENIUS Act, which created a federal framework for stablecoin regulation.

Narrow window of advantage

BofA argues that tokenized MMF products could temporarily offer a competitive edge by combining traditional yields with blockchain-based settlement efficiency. However, this advantage may prove short-lived if stablecoins find ways to integrate yield features.

For now, analysts believe MMFs still hold the upper hand, but the rapid convergence of digital assets with traditional finance suggests the U.S. debt market may continue evolving in ways few anticipated just a few years ago.",https://cryptodnes.bg/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bank-of-america-rolls-out-erica-trial-basis.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 12:59:15.468491

Liu purchased three Bay leases at her own B.C. malls for $6 million, but her deal to buy the other 25 for $69.1 million has faced opposition from one of the retailer’s biggest lenders and most of its landlords.

They say the leases don’t allow for the dining, entertainment and recreational spaces Liu has talked about opening within the department stores she will operate in the properties.

They also say Liu’s timelines and budgets are too unrealistic given the amount of work and repairs their properties need.

Liu says she doesn’t think the spaces need all of the repairs landlords are demanding because the Bay was operating in the spaces without the renovations. If they are necessary, she says her company will do them, even if they exceed her current budget.

Shares of online grocery delivery platform Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) fell 3.8% in the morning session after Wedbush downgraded the stock, citing concerns about increasing competition from Amazon. The firm lowered its rating to 'Underperform' from 'Neutral' and slashed its price target on the stock to $42 from $55. The downgrade was driven by heightened competition from Amazon's expanding same-day perishable grocery delivery service. Wedbush's analysis suggests that as Amazon competes more closely, Instacart's market share is expected to erode over time. The firm believes consumers are increasingly gravitating towards value-driven services, making Amazon's Prime offering a more compelling option for grocery shoppers, which puts pressure on Instacart to protect its position in the market.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Instacart’s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

Instacart is up 2.9% since the beginning of the year, but at $44.30 per share, it is still trading 16.7% below its 52-week high of $53.15 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Instacart’s shares at the IPO in September 2023 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,315.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/maplebear-cover-image-f38a9b652676_2025-08-13-140510_frnz.jpeg,N,,2025-08-21 13:02:08.093975

NKE is at a turning point as some of its most iconic franchises, like the Air Force 1, Dunk and AJ1, are fading in consumer demand. The company has deliberately taken steps to rightsize these franchises, even as it created a nearly $1 billion revenue headwind in fiscal 2025. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, classic footwear declined by more than 30%, forcing NIKE to accelerate markdowns and inventory cleanup. While painful in the short term, this strategy reflects the company’s intent to reset its brand positioning and focus on a healthier, more innovative product portfolio.

To fuel recovery, NIKE is betting heavily on fresh launches and sport-led innovation. The company’s performance categories are showing encouraging signs, with products like the Vomero 18 already crossing $100 million in sales within 90 days, and A’ja Wilson’s signature basketball line selling out in minutes. NIKE is also expanding into women’s basketball, training apparel and global football with new kits and upgraded boot lines ahead of the World Cup. By aligning its business into sport-specific teams, the company hopes to deepen athlete connections and roll out a consistent stream of innovative, coveted products.

The challenge lies in whether these new franchises can scale quickly enough to offset the drag from fading classics. Wholesale partners are showing renewed confidence, with holiday order books improving, and NIKE’s direct-to-consumer channels becoming more premium-focused. Still, digital traffic remains pressured, and China’s recovery is expected to take longer. Success will depend on the company’s ability to keep its launches relevant, scale new products at speed and rebuild consumer excitement across performance and lifestyle categories. If executed well, NIKE’s fresh wave of innovation could write the next chapter of growth while the brand gradually reduces reliance on its aging icons.

More than half of Americans say drinking in moderation is bad for their health, and almost 50% are drinking less in 2025, according to numerous surveys.

As a result, total alcohol sales are on the decline. The spirits sector experienced its first drop since 2004 last year with a 1.1% dip in sales; while beer sales fell by 0.7% and wine sales dropped 2.5%. In fact, the fastest-growing beer brand sold at Target this July contains less than 1% alcohol.

“Over the past decade, American drinking culture has undergone a pretty major transformation,” says Jackie Widmann, SVP of marketing for Bero, the non-alcoholic brand that topped Target’s beer sales last month. “What used to be a very binary choice, drink or don’t drink, has opened up into a spectrum.”

While Ireland imposes 18-hour blackouts of alcohol TV ads, France prohibits alcohol advertising in movie theaters and Lithuania bans alcohol marketing altogether to target underage drinking rates, American marketers are scrambling to capture consumer interest, especially the 45% of Gen Z adults who have never had a drink.

Expect beer ads to be ubiquitous once again this fall during college and pro football broadcasts in the U.S. But beer, wine and spirits brands are also getting creative and going beyond traditional earned and paid media models to reach young consumers.

That includes Stella Artois sponsoring the Hot Ones YouTube series, Michelob Ultra featuring six-packs and Serena Williams in its fitness-focused campaigns or Spider-Man’s Tom Holland launching an alcohol-free beer.

In the Ozempic era, ‘athlete’s beer’ leads the race

Beer, which accounts for nearly 40% of American alcohol sales, is losing consumers who are trying to lose weight. With the rise of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, beer sales have dropped 0.3% nationwide since last year.

“Consumers want to know what’s in their glass,” says Darco Spirits CMO Sarah Leonard. “There’s a heightened focus on ingredients, organic credentials, gluten-free options and products made with natural flavors.”

Bud Light, Corona and Stella Artois owner Anheuser-Busch InBev’s year-over-year revenue dropped 2.35% between 2024 and 2025, and Bud Light’s revenue has been bogged down since its 2023 collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, which sparked a boycott of the brand by right-leaning consumers.

But Michelob Ultra, AB InBev’s leading brand, is an exception. The brand released a 29-calorie, non-alcoholic beer called Michelob Ultra Zero last September to allow “21-plus consumers more choice as part of an active lifestyle,” according to the product’s announcement.

“One very broad barrier that we broke for a while already is the carbs and calories. That’s why Michelob Ultra does so well in the U.S.,” says AB InBev chief executive Michel Doukeris during an earnings call in May, citing gluten, alcohol and sugar as barriers for consumers.

Since its 2002 Lose the Carbs, Not the Taste brand launch campaign, Michelob Ultra has focused its message on fitness. The self-proclaimed “athlete’s beer” sells branded golf and running gear, released a 6 for 6-Pack 2020 Super Bowl spot and partnered with world-famous athletes including World Cup soccer champion Lionel Messi and 23-time tennis Grand Slam winner Serena Williams.

Michelob Ultra’s fitness theme has worked out: the brewer saw a 3.1% increase in sales this spring compared to last year.

Michelob Ultra and Anheuser-Busch InBev did not immediately respond to PRWeek’s request for comments.

Spider-Man’s non-alcoholic beer climbs onto mainstream shelves

View this post on Instagram

A post shared by Tom Holland (@tomholland2013)

Tom Holland, who has played Marvel’s Spider-Man for almost a decade and who has been publicly sober since 2022, launched non-alcoholic beer brand Bero in 2024 as part of his sobriety journey. The brand offers Kingston Golden Pils, Edge Hill Hazy IPA and Noon Wheat beers, which are all brewed to have an alcohol content of less than 0.5%.

With a comms focus on balance, not sobriety, Bero is marketed as a “choice for those who are seeking mindful indulgence” rather than promoting full sobriety, Widmann says, noting the brand's consumer base ranges from “sober, sober-curious or just pacing themselves.”

“The future is about coexistence,” Widmann says. “Consumers don’t silo their choices anymore. They might have a cocktail one night and non-alcoholic beer the next.”

The sober-curious movement, which encourages alcohol consumers to examine their relationship with alcohol rather than becoming fully and immediately sober, is gaining traction. Over 30% of Americans took a break from alcohol during “dry January” 2025, doubling from the year before.

In the past year, Bero has expanded to retailers including GoPuff, Erewhon, Sprouts and Total Wine and has “doubled down” on marketing that places Bero in sports, entertainment and at-home hosting spaces alongside traditional alcohol brands “so consumers naturally see it as part of the occasion,” Widmann explains.

“It’s resonating because it’s not about restriction, it’s about freedom and inclusivity,” Widmann says of Bero’s marketing.

Sipping with social media stars pulls GenZ in

In addition to Holland, alcohol brands frequently team up with A-list celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Blake Lively, Now, alcohol marketing is pivoting to internet celebrities, using influencers’ personal branding to pitch booze to Gen Z, an age group known for low alcohol consumption.

James Park, a Korean-American culinary creator with more than 255,000 Instagram and TikTok followers, has partnered with Korean alcohol beverage brands such as Makku, Wild Mannered and SWRL to “share Korean food and drinking culture.”

“When cooking creators are involved, the focus shifts to creating a balanced meal rather than consuming alcohol alone,” Park says. “Cooking with alcohol, like using wine to deepen flavors, also shows how alcohol can enhance dishes even for those who don’t drink. It’s a creative way for brands to demonstrate the versatility and enjoyment of their products.”

Aside from using alcohol as recipe ingredients, Park focuses alcohol beverage brand content around “anju,” a Korean term for dishes specifically designed to be paired with drinks, to show how “foods elevate the overall drinking experience,” he says.

“Younger consumers care about health, wellness and self-care more than ever, and alcohol can sometimes be positioned as the opposite of that,” Park explains. “But alcohol also brings people together, creates lasting memories and breaks down social barriers.”

Perhaps the hottest culinary creator-alcohol beverage brand relationship of the moment is Stella Artois’ partnership with First We Feast, the media company behind the YouTube interview series Hot Ones. The show, in which host Sean Evans interviews celebrities like Gordon Ramsey and Ariana Grande as they eat increasingly spicy chicken wings, announced Stella Artois as its official beer sponsor in 2024 to subdue the featured hot sauces’ spice. (Photo credit: Stella Artois).

Unlike Park and Evans, self-proclaimed “hot mess” content creator Alix Earle entered the alcoholic beverage industry in a more traditional way: appealing to fans who party. Earle began her TikTok career with “get ready with me” makeup tutorials preparing for University of Miami tailgates and Santa bar crawls and launched her line of Sip Margs canned margaritas in March.

More trends on tap

Consumers are ready to buy “ready to drink.” Espresso martinis and strawberry margaritas are packaged in spherical, brightly colored bottles designed by BuzzBallz, one of the fastest-growing companies in the ready-to-drink category. The brand sold over 7 million cases last year, and consumers have posted over 67,000 videos with BuzzBallz on TikTok alone.

The RTD beverage market, which accounts for 12% of U.S. alcohol sales and includes canned wines, pre-mixed cocktails and hard seltzers, is expected to value over $40 million by 2027. Spirit brands have heavily tapped into the space. Whiskey brand Jack Daniel’s released Jack & Coca Cola and Bacardí created rum punch in a can, for example.

Identity-focused alcohol branding like Mom Water, Girl Beer and Gay Water Vodka Soda cater to the growing number of consumers choosing brands that align with their identity, including the 60% of Gen Z who view the brands they choose as a form of self-expression.

Many consumers and influencers alike are noticing which alcohol brands celebrate their identities, especially amid DEI rollbacks and the federal de-funding of LGBTQ+ programs this year. Lesbian and nonbinary content creator Hina Sabatine, who has nearly 2 million followers across TikTok and Instagram, expressed support for Absolut Vodka while discussing this year’s Pride campaigns, saying many of their friends only drink Absolut because the brand has sponsored Pride events since 1981.

Wine has taken the biggest hit with GenZ’s disinterest in alcohol, perhaps because “wine mom” culture was deemed problematic with a flurry of critical TikTok posts in 2024. LVMH’s wines and spirits saw a 9% decline in Q1, following an 8% drop in annual sales in 2024.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/ORP/michelobultra-g-rm-prwus-2219669159.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 12:57:39.747565

Billionaire investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, has sounded a cautionary note on the U.S. stock market, suggesting it may be entering the initial phases of a bubble. In a recent interview highlighted by Business Insider, Marks points to elevated valuations and investor behavior as key indicators. Drawing from decades of experience, he warns that while the market isn’t yet in full-blown euphoria, the ingredients for excess are simmering, potentially leading to painful corrections if unchecked.

Marks emphasizes that bubbles often form when optimism overrides fundamentals, a pattern he’s observed in past cycles like the dot-com era. He argues that current market dynamics, fueled by artificial intelligence hype and loose monetary policy, are pushing stock prices beyond reasonable levels. Investors, he says, are making a critical mistake by ignoring these risks and chasing returns without adequate due diligence.

Psychological Underpinnings of Bubbles

This perspective aligns with Marks’ latest memo, “On Bubble Watch,” published on the Oaktree Capital website earlier this year. In it, he revisits the psychological drivers of market excesses, noting that fear of missing out (FOMO) can distort rational decision-making. For 2025, Marks sees similar early signs: high price-to-earnings ratios in tech sectors and a concentration of gains in a handful of mega-cap stocks.

Industry insiders might recall Marks’ prescient 2000 warning about tech stock overvaluation, which preceded the burst of the internet bubble. Today, he stops short of declaring a full bubble, stating in the memo that markets feel “high-priced and perhaps frothy” but not “nutty.” Yet, he urges vigilance, pointing to missing elements like widespread speculative frenzy that could tip the scales.

Broader Market Warnings Echo Marks’ Views

Echoing these concerns, a mid-year outlook from J.P. Morgan Research highlights policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks as amplifiers of volatility in the latter half of 2025. The report suggests that persistent macroeconomic turbulence could exacerbate bubble-like conditions, particularly if interest rate cuts fuel further speculation.

Meanwhile, Bank of America analysts have flagged similar risks, predicting in a June analysis covered by Business Insider that lower rates and potential tax cuts might inflate a bubble in growth stocks. This comes amid warnings from Société Générale, as reported in another Business Insider piece, that Federal Reserve actions could push the S&P 500 into overvalued territory.

Investing Mistakes to Avoid

For professional investors, Marks’ advice centers on avoiding the herd mentality. He cautions against overpaying for assets in buoyant times, advocating instead for a value-oriented approach that prioritizes intrinsic worth over momentum. In his August 2025 memo, “The Calculus of Value,” shared via Hedge Fund Alpha, Marks delves into the math of valuation, stressing how psychological biases can lead to mispricings.

This resonates with Morningstar’s August 2025 stock market outlook, which notes that valuation spikes are concentrated in just five mega-cap names, as detailed on their website. Such concentration risks echo the vulnerabilities Marks identifies, where a shift in sentiment could trigger broad sell-offs.

Strategies for Navigating Uncertainty

To mitigate these dangers, insiders are advised to diversify beyond high-flying sectors. Marks recommends scrutinizing underlying earnings growth and being wary of narratives that justify sky-high multiples. Historical parallels, like those in his Livewire Markets discussion from January, as covered by Livewire Markets, outline four signs of a market top: excessive optimism, rejection of prudence, widespread risk-taking, and disregard for value.

As the year progresses, with potential rate adjustments on the horizon, monitoring these indicators becomes crucial. Publications like Seeking Alpha have amplified Marks’ views, reporting in a recent article on their platform that defensive portfolio strategies may be warranted. By heeding such insights, investors can position themselves to weather any brewing storm.

Long-Term Implications for 2025 and Beyond

Looking ahead, the convergence of these warnings paints a picture of a market at a crossroads. Economic Times pieces, such as one on their site, question whether mega-cap dominance will falter, potentially signaling a bubble’s end. Another from the same outlet, accessible at Economic Times, notes S&P 500 valuations exceeding dot-com peaks.

Ultimately, Marks’ message is timeless: bubbles are inevitable in cycles of greed and fear, but disciplined investing can turn risks into opportunities. For those in the know, staying grounded amid the froth could define success in 2025’s volatile environment.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-8cc8f05f-047a-4dd5-b1ca-c97b8b893ba1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-21 14:16:29.603232

According to data from CoinGlass, open interest in LINK futures has soared to a record $1.5 billion, up nearly 60% since the start of 2025. On-chain data also shows a major spike in activity, with 9,625 new LINK wallets created on August 18, the highest daily figure of 2025, while 9,813 active addresses were transacting just a day earlier.

This is being fueled by institutional adoption. More than 30 financial institutions are now piloting or testing Chainlink-powered solutions, pushing confidence that LINK could be one of the biggest winners of this market cycle.

Three Drivers Behind LINK’s Growth

1. Chainlink Reserves Program

The project recently launched Chainlink Reserves, a system where LINK tokens are purchased on the open market and locked away for years. The funds for these purchases come from both DeFi revenues and enterprise clients like Mastercard. By reducing circulating supply, the reserves act like a vacuum, supporting long-term price growth.

2. Wall Street Integration

The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, has tapped Chainlink to bring foreign exchange (forex) and precious metals data on-chain. This move could be the first step toward broader Wall Street integration, eventually extending into major exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ.

3. SWIFT Partnership

Chainlink is also working with SWIFT, the global banking communication network used by thousands of financial institutions. Instead of each bank experimenting with different blockchains, SWIFT is adopting Chainlink as a single “abstraction layer.” This allows banks like Citibank, BNP Paribas, and BNY Mellon to connect to blockchain infrastructure using Chainlink as the bridge.

Price Levels and Market Outlook

Immediate resistance sits around $29–31, while support lies near $21–22. If LINK can reclaim $26 and hold, analysts say it could push it higher into lighter liquidity zones.

For the long-term outlook, many are asking: Can LINK reach $100?

The Gamecocks are expected to make the switch from Under Armour to Nike, pending approval from the Board of Trustees on Friday, The State confirmed through a USC source. The news was first reported by The (Charleston) Post and Courier.

The announcement comes as South Carolina’s 10-year deal with Under Armour is nearing its June 30, 2026 expiration date. That deal, signed by former AD Ray Tanner, was worth just over $71 million.

While the contract states Under Armour has exclusive negotiating rights with South Carolina through 2025, it is quite common for that “exclusivity window” to get pushed up. The reason being that schools typically order apparel a year in advance and, therefore, need to know a year out which company to order from.

Certainly, the connections are there. South Carolina Athletic Director Jeremiah Donati comes from TCU, where he extended the Horned Frogs’ deal with Nike in 2013, saying of the apparel giant, “They are truly the best in the business.”

It should also be noted that Nike’s CEO is Elliott Hill, a TCU alum who also serves on the school’s board of trustees.

The firm also cut its price target to $42 from $55, implying about 8% downside from Wednesday’s close.

The downgrade comes as Instacart’s stock has faced sustained pressure in recent months, losing more than 13% in the past six months and over 7% in the last month.

A key factor has been intensified competition, particularly from Amazon’s expansion of same-day grocery delivery services.

Amazon’s expansion fuels competitive pressures

Copy link to section

Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt pointed to Amazon’s recent rollout of same-day delivery for fresh foods across more than 1,000 US cities and towns as a significant challenge for Instacart.

The launch earlier this month triggered an 11% decline in Instacart’s stock and, according to Devitt, has made Amazon Prime “an even more compelling subscription for grocery shoppers, diminishing the appeal of Instacart.”

Although Instacart has reported healthy growth in gross transaction value (GTV) and improving margins in recent quarters, Devitt cautioned that the competitive landscape has shifted dramatically.

“The recent expansion of Amazon’s same-day perishable grocery delivery service has intensified the competitive environment,” he wrote.

Devitt added that while Instacart may carve out a niche by offering omnichannel support for local and regional grocers with limited resources, larger players like Amazon could ultimately draw more consumers with stronger value propositions.

Market share decline raises concerns

Copy link to section

Wedbush also flagged concerns about Instacart’s shrinking share of the grocery delivery market relative to its peers.

The company’s market share among intermediaries has dropped to roughly 58% in 2024, down from about 70% two years ago.

Competitors such as Uber and DoorDash have gained ground during this period.

There are also risks that Instacart’s major retail partners could shift more online grocery demand to their first-party platforms over time, further eroding the company’s position.

To defend its market share, Devitt warned, Instacart may need to increase spending on incentives, sales, and marketing—steps that could weigh on profitability and reduce long-term visibility.

Looking ahead, Wedbush expects only mid-single-digit to low-single-digit GTV growth on a year-over-year basis, reflecting heightened caution about Instacart’s ability to hit its long-term targets.

Analysts divided despite downgrade

Copy link to section

Despite the downgrade, Wall Street remains divided on Instacart.

According to LSEG data, 18 of the 34 analysts covering the stock maintain a strong buy or buy rating, while the remaining 16 have a hold rating.

This split reflects both recognition of Instacart’s operational progress and lingering concerns about its ability to withstand increasing competition in the grocery delivery market.

""But it needs to be everything we want: right transfer fee, right position and the player wants to come to us.""
Show more The questions will continue to be fired at both Slot and Eddie Howe before a resolution is finally reached.
But the main one, for now, remains just where Isak will be when the September 1 deadline passes.
Liverpool have two of the big three 'conditions' - to quote Newcastle themselves - ticked off in their pursuit of Isak.","With baited breath - and against both their better judgement and experience of asking Arne Slot such questions - the collective media, which included the Liverpool ECHO at the AXA Training Centre on Thursday afternoon, braced themselves for an update on Alexander Isak.

Given Liverpool saw an offer of £110m rejected at the start of the month before seeing the wantaway Newcastle United striker refuse to play, continue to train on his own and then - after being left out of the Premier League opener at Aston Villa - release an explosive statement on social media suggesting his time at St James' Park is at an end, some might have expected Slot to have a reply lined up his sleeve.

But in the same way he continued to fend off weekly questions around Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold's respective contract situations last season, the Reds head coach played the straightest of bats to the Isak topic and the prospect of a potential British record transfer.

""What I can tell you is not a lot!"" he replied. ""And if someone else asks the question it is going to be the same answer. I could even impact the game Friday with the players I had on the bench, Federico [Chiesa] came in and scored a goal, so it would be much nicer to talk about the players I have, but I understand [you have to ask].""

Pushed further to offer some sort of update from Liverpool's end, Slot added: ""I don't think [it will be a busy end to the window], because [that would mean] I would be unhappy with the squad and I am happy with the squad we are having.

""I say two players for each position is ideal but sometimes less is more so you are not disappointing players. I am happy with the squad but if we think there is a player who can really make us better then this club has always shown they can bring them in.

""But it needs to be everything we want: right transfer fee, right position and the player wants to come to us."" Two outta three ain't bad, as someone once said.

Where Isak is concerned it is at least the right position. The Reds are in need of another forward having sold Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich for £65m and Darwin Nunez to Al Hilal for around £45m, before further draining the pool of frontmen by allowing Ben Doak to depart to Bournemouth in a £25m deal.

And when it comes to Isak's wanting to come to Anfield, he could hardly have made his desire to move more clear given his antics in the last month or so.

This is very much not the way he would have liked to have engineered his exit, but clearly it's a case of needs-must now for the 25-year-old as the final week of the window nears.

The right transfer fee, though? That remains someway away.

An offer of £110m was turned down with the Magpies widely reported to be seeking closer to £150m and while a compromise in the middle was thought of as being the magic figure by those connected to the North East club in recent weeks, the genuine bombshell from Isak on Tuesday night does not yet appear to have made a dent in the resolve of Newcastle's owners, who, if a reminder was necessary, are the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.

BOULDER, Colo., Aug. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Curtis Duffy, acclaimed chef, restaurateur, and advisory board member for Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts, visited the school's Boulder campus today to lead an exclusive professional development session for chef instructors and to meet with students during a special campus event connected to his new memoir written with Jeremy Wagner and published with Dead Sky Publishing,Fireproof: Memoir of a Chef.

The on-campus engagement marked the only culinary school visit on Duffy's national book tour and followed a public event the night prior at Boulder Bookstore, where he spoke with Escoffier Boulder Campus President and Provost Kirk T. Bachmann in front of a crowd of 50+ ticket holders. During the event, Duffy discussed the emotional and professional journey chronicled in Fireproof—from personal tragedy to global culinary acclaim.

At Escoffier, Duffy led an in-depth professional development session for faculty, sharing insights on mentorship and the lasting influence of his own mentors. He discussed the responsibility of giving back, leading by example, and outlined strategies for preparing the next generation of culinary professionals.

He spoke about cultivating resilience, encouraging students to think creatively, honing technical skills, nurturing curiosity, and modeling the professional standards that define success in the kitchen. ""Shift your mindset to how much of a privilege it is to do something you love to do,"" Duffy told the group. ""I'm honored to work every day to help my younger staff achieve their goals."" He added that faculty should always strive to ""set the standard to do better every day.""

Chef Duffy's time on campus included connecting with students, signing copies of Fireproof and offering brief words of encouragement during his visit.

""This session gave our faculty an opportunity to learn from one of the industry's most accomplished chefs,"" said Bachmann, who also moderated the campus discussion. ""Curtis's honesty, humility, and insight offer our instructors new ways to support and inspire the next generation of culinary talent. He's considered part of the Escoffier family and his continued involvement strengthens the connection between our classrooms and the realities of the industry."" Photos from the campus event show Duffy engaging with faculty, exchanging ideas, and sharing meaningful moments from Fireproof—a memoir that resonates far beyond the kitchen.

Luna Health, a startup developing an insulin patch pump to help with overnight glucose control, raised $23.6 million in Series A funding.

The company is developing a small patch pump with a fully closed-loop insulin dosing algorithm, intended for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who rely on insulin pens.

Luna plans to use the funds to advance regulatory submissions, conduct clinical studies, build manufacturing capacity and expand clinical access programs, the company said in a Monday announcement.

Dive Insight:

Luna was founded by three executives who have a background in healthcare technology, and have personal experience managing diabetes — either for themselves or their children.

CEO John Sjölund and CFO Jon Brilliant, both co-founders of the company, previously were executives at Bigfoot Biomedical, a company that makes smart pen caps that use data from continuous glucose monitors to provide insulin dose recommendations. Abbott acquired the company in 2023.

Beta Bionics CEO Sean Saint is also a co-founder and board member of Luna.

They started the company with the goal of opening access to insulin patch pumps for people who take multiple daily insulin injections. During the day, people continue to use their insulin pens. However, at night, the patch pump can deliver rapid-acting insulin, calculating the dose automatically using CGM data.

“We regularly hear from the diabetes community about their struggles with nighttime glucose control,” Sjölund wrote in a blog post on Monday. “Parents of children with Type 1 diabetes who set multiple alarms to check blood sugar levels. Adults with Type 2 diabetes who avoid evening activities because they’re worried about overnight complications.”

Traditional insulin pumps can help with nighttime glucose control, but they can be complex, expensive and require lifestyle changes.

Because if we’re serious about building Black fashion into heritage brands with the same staying power as Ralph Lauren or Chanel, it won’t happen by accident. It starts here, with intentional support for the designers doing it for the culture, not the calendar.

Take BruceGlen, the twin design duo known for their kaleidoscope of color and irreverent prints that can turn a Tuesday into a full-blown celebration. Or Hanifa, whose founder Anifa Mvuemba shook the industry with that 3D fashion show and continues to deliver sculptural, body-conscious pieces that demand attention. Then there’s Freddie Estelle, bringing polished edge to everyday wear, and Fumi The Label, with romantic silhouettes that marry structure and softness. Chuks Collins is redefining menswear with artistry and fluidity, while Phelmuns flips the script on upcycling, proving sustainability doesn’t mean sacrificing style. And All is Well? That’s quiet luxury with a Black lens, a reminder that minimalism can still be radical. These aren’t mall brands—they’re insider favorites, the kind of labels you spot on the people who set trends, not chase them.

The stakes are bigger than hype. Every time we buy Black; we chip away at an industry that has historically shut us out. Every time we wear these brands to brunch, to the club, to the boardroom, we’re investing in a vision of fashion where our stories have permanence, not just a season, but a shelf life.

So, the next time you’re looking for something new to wear, skip the algorithm’s suggestions and look to the labels shaping tomorrow. Because in the days of trying to build our own heritage, the investment isn’t just financial—it’s cultural. And culture, when protected, doesn’t expire.

The good news is that your experience—perhaps even wisdom—combined with your income means your sixties could be your best-dressed decade.
New York–based personal stylist Peter Nguyen works with professional guys in their sixties.
That’s key to dressing well at any age: being authentic.
Guys in their sixties should look for paints with a little room and a single pleat that hit around the belly button.","For proof that men in their sixties, and beyond, can still be stylish, you need only look at the boardrooms of the fashion industry itself. British founder-designer Sir Paul Smith, seventy-nine, is a walking billboard for the well-cut navy suit. And at the spritely age of eighty-five, Mr. Ralph Lauren is a testament that the innate sense of adventurous pleasure that style offers—be it westernwear, classic prep, or even slick Wall Street tailoring—is open to all, whatever age they may be.

But some of the latest big-ticket ad campaigns have highlighted a specific demographic: men in their sixties. Designer Peter Saville, sixty-nine, appeared in a Ferragamo campaign recently. Watch collector Auro Montanari, sixty-seven, was in a recent Zegna campaign. Actor Richard E. Grant, sixty-eight, took the runway with aplomb for Burberry. Hollywood offers even more inspiration: Sixty-four-year-old George Clooney, sixty-one-year-old Brad Pitt, and sixty-eight-year-old Spike Lee remain among the most stylish men in show business. It seems sexagenarians have never been cooler.

The sixty-eight-year-old actor Richard E. Grant and his daughter Olivia head into a party after the Burberry fashion show in which he modeled.

So what does that mean for you, a man in his sixties looking to improve his style game? The good news is that your experience—perhaps even wisdom—combined with your income means your sixties could be your best-dressed decade. Here’s how to do it.

Choose Timeless Over Trendy

First, make no sudden moves. New York–based personal stylist Peter Nguyen works with professional guys in their sixties. He says the most common mistake they make is “wearing things the young kids wear in an attempt to look younger or in style.” That might be a pair of hype-heavy sneakers, a piece that’s metallic or sheer, or heavily branded garments—clothing designed to draw attention to the wearer’s engagement in the zeitgeist, essentially. But what’s cutting-edge cool for a twenty-something kid probably won’t be right for you.

Peter Saville and Auro Montanari represent a laid-back, almost cozy chic that’s ideal for their sartorial generation. Soft tailoring, roomy but well-cut pants, delicate knitwear, and the odd flourish here and there (an out-there pair of glasses, perhaps, or a drool-some watch) stave off any overall banality. Their style is timeless rather than trendy.

The sixty-nine-year-old Peter Saville represents a laid-back, almost cozy chic.

That said, Nguyen sees clients who assume certain youth-skewed pieces, like leather jackets or even sneakers, are off-limits. And that just isn’t the case. It might be worth avoiding the latest fluorescent wraparound shades, but a classic leather bomber could be just the ticket. “I totally understand the fear older guys have of looking like they’re trying hard to look young,” says Nguyen. “The secret is pulling from an authentic place. Jeff Goldblum can pull off the edgy-with-a-bit-of-quirk outfits because he’s always been a bit of a quirky guy with edge.”

Jeff Goldblum, who isn’t in his sixties (he’s seventy-two), is a more adventurous dresser, which is authentic to who he’s always been. That’s key to dressing well at any age: being authentic.

Start with some introspection. What kind of style are you looking to achieve, and how can it marry with the way you dress now? Perhaps you want to make a major change, but how would it work with your day-to-day lifestyle? And are there guys like Goldblum or Grant you’d like to emulate?

How Should Your Clothes Fit?

Once you have the groundwork nailed, it’s important to understand how your clothes should fit. Generally, as guys get older, their bodies change and, in turn, clothes tend to get a little looser, which is fine. There is an assumption that “cool” means a slim or skinny fit, and that’s just wrong. In fact, skinny fits rarely look good on anyone, regardless of age.

Nguyen is a firm believer in the “rule of thirds,” which denotes that your pants should equate to around two thirds of your outfit’s total height, so your waistband should probably hit somewhere around the belly button, especially on more formal pants.

“I think all guys should be wearing their pants with a higher rise to get that two-third legs proportion that’s extremely flattering,” he says.

Guys in their sixties should look for paints with a little room and a single pleat that hit around the belly button. Take inspiration from Steven Taffel, sixty-eight, owner of the high-end shoe store Leffot, who was photographed for the Esquire series Five Fits.

Skinny pants with a higher rise look especially insane, so opt for pants with a little more room in the leg. You don’t necessarily need to go for the very full width that’s been on trend for a while now, but a regular straight fit would work.

Younger guys might pair those wider-leg pants with a slightly cropped top—maybe a tee or button-up shirt—but the smart play for older guys is to go classic. A cashmere crewneck knit, for example, or even just a great oxford-cotton button-down shirt, tucked into the waistband with a soft, unstructured jacket or overshirt on top. has a great range of soft-shouldered jackets that look like a blazer but feel like a cardigan.

The Workhorses of Your Wardrobe

Overall, err on the more formal side. That doesn’t require wearing a suit every day—though Sir Paul Smith’s uniform of a simple navy suit and open-neck shirt is a solid, fuss-free option—but it does mean soft-collared shirts or knit polos instead of T-shirts; corduroy or linen pants in place of denim jeans; and unlined, easy-wearing sport coats rather than techy outerwear. You’re looking to come at modern style from a more timeless perspective and trying to achieve a look that says, “I know what I’m doing,” not “I’m trying to look younger.”

The designer Paul Smith, who’s seventy-nine, wears an unfussy navy-blue suit and white shirt without a tie.

It’s a kind of studious ease that was perhaps best typified by Oscar Isaac in the 2021 HBO series Scenes from a Marriage. Isaac is not even fifty, and was even younger then, but stylist Miyako Bellizzi created a wardrobe that completely nailed older-guy style: sumptuous earthy colors, comfortable fits, and fabrics that speak of taste and good craftsmanship. Bellizzi mixed together pieces by Prada, Fear of God, Beams, Dries Van Noten, Loro Piana, and New Balance. (And note the use of high/low styling—a neat trick for older-guy style.)

Oscar Isaac in the 2019 HBO series Scenes from a Marriage. Although he wasn’t even fifty when shot the series, his style exemplifies great older-guy style.

Nguyen recommends investing in a pair of high-rise, single-pleat pants in a neutral color—a “wardrobe workhorse that upgrades any outfit,” he says. Add to that a chambray shirt in a darker shade of blue, which is both “flatteringly masculine” and “extremely versatile,” and a pair of minimal sneakers in either white or mid-brown suede. “A lot of my older clients have switched to less stylish and more comfort-focused sneakers,” he says. Minimalist sneakers—like those made by Greats, , and many other brands (here are some Esquire recommendations)—are a huge and simple upgrade.

If that all feels a little bland, consider adding flourishes with poppy accessories. Spike Lee does it with out-there spectacles, and George Clooney, a consummate low-key dresser, is also equipped with an Omega watch that perks up his outfits. Even a well-chosen ball cap can breathe life into an otherwise understated outfit. Just avoid that pair of Air Maxes.

Thanks to consistently high credit ratings from the three major independent rating agencies, Arlington expects to secure a low-interest rate when it sells bonds for the purchase in September.

Upgrading the outdated equipment is essential to maintaining reliable communication for our first responders. The new radios, which will be in use ahead of the nine FIFA World Cup games at AT&T Stadium next summer, will enhance the first responders’ operational effectiveness by incorporating modern technologies like GPS and high-speed wireless communication as well as artificial intelligence for the police officers. These features will improve radio coverage, ensure more reliable connectivity, and increase efficiency during both emergency responses and daily operations.

The new radios will replace police and fire radios that have been in service for more than 10 years and are no longer supported by the manufacturer, making repairs and maintenance difficult due to discontinued parts.

Arlington was able to negotiate a lower price on the communication equipment through discounts offered by the State of Texas Department of Information Resources, which is part of the State of Texas Cooperative Purchasing Program, and through leveraging other contracts the Police Department has with the manufacturer.

City’s Strong Bond Ratings Help Save Interest on Debt

The City of Arlington is scheduled to sell $45.5 million in bonds to fund the public safety communications purchase, along with other voter-approved projects for Fire vehicles, Police facilities, Parks & Recreation, Public Works and the Arlington Public Library, in late September.

Arlington’s fiscally sound policies, financial resilience, and manageable long-term liabilities have also resulted in consistently high credit ratings from the three major independent rating agencies: S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Ratings, and Fitch Ratings. These strong ratings are crucial as they enable the City to secure lower interest rates on its debt, ultimately saving taxpayer dollars. Arlington expects around a 4% interest rate on the 20-year debt, which will also include $8.5 million for fire vehicles, $2.4 million in library facility repairs, $1.8 million for Parks and Recreation projects, $4 million in police station repairs and $20.6 million for Public Works projects that were approved by Arlington voters in the 2018, 2023 and 2025 bond elections.

Recently, the agencies affirmed their confidence in Arlington’s financial management:

S&P Global Ratings affirmed all three credits with its highest rating of AAA. In its rating, the agency cited: “The stable outlook reflects our view that Arlington’s strong economic growth and robust liquidity position will continue to be supported by its sophisticated management team. We also anticipate that additional debt will be mitigated by its growing tax base.”

Moody’s Ratings affirmed all three credits with their second highest rating of Aa1. In its rating, the agency cited: “Strong financial management, including adherence to formal policies and multiyear forecasting, will support continued stable financial performance even as the city contends with more modest property tax revenue growth over the next few years.”

Fitch Ratings affirmed the Water and Wastewater System (WWS) and Stormwater credits with their highest rating of AAA.

For years, these agencies have highlighted Arlington’s strong performance, financial resilience, and prudent management of long-term liabilities. These consistent recognitions demonstrate the City’s ongoing commitment to responsible fiscal stewardship and transparency for the benefit of its community.",https://www.arlingtontx.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/news/articles-police-and-fire-logos.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-08-21 11:11:59.221484

The journey started July 23, when the Jets conducted their first training camp practice.
For the past four weeks, he has conducted a camp unlike any the Jets have experienced in more than a decade.
""He's not afraid of confrontation,"" said Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, a Glenn confidant who believes that's a necessary trait for a head coach.
This, Glenn told him, was a necessary step toward achieving his ultimate goal -- head coach.","FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- To underscore his promise of a prosperous future for the New York Jets, first-year coach Aaron Glenn believed the team needed to see his past -- specifically, his experiences with franchise turnarounds.

So in the auditorium of the Jets' facility, he punched up a giant illustration of his career, visual proof that he's been there, done that in more than one NFL city. For each example, he provided a detailed explanation of how it was accomplished.

He was the defensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions, who went from 3-13-1 to 15-2 over his four years, 2021 to 2024. Before that, he was the secondary coach of the New Orleans Saints, who made four consecutive playoff appearances after a three-year swoon. As a star cornerback with the Jets, he lost 45 of his first 64 games before reaching the AFC Championship Game in 1998.

Over and over, Glenn has seen losing turn to winning, and he believes he possesses the cheat code that will allow these current Jets to do the same. Since their last winning season (2015), no team has lost more than the Jets -- a league-worst 46-102 record (.311).

Before kicking off training camp, Glenn wanted his players to see that it can be done, that laughingstocks can indeed get the last laugh. You might say this was his green print for the Jets' future.

""Seeing that on the board and seeing the testimony of where he's been and how he's coached, and what they expected from each other -- it shows there's light at the end of the tunnel,"" said tight end Jeremy Ruckert, a lifelong Jets fan from Long Island.

The journey started July 23, when the Jets conducted their first training camp practice. That day, Glenn was wide awake by 3:30 a.m., eager to get started, fulfilling his dream of coaching the team that drafted him in 1994.

For the past four weeks, he has conducted a camp unlike any the Jets have experienced in more than a decade. We collected a few snapshots for a photo album.

GLENN DIDN'T WASTE the first day in full pads. As promised, he conducted a live, one-on-one tackling drill.

Resembling an old-school coach from central casting, Glenn crouched between ball carrier and defender, ball cap pulled down low, sending two players at a time into action with short, piercing sounds from his whistle.

Nowadays, live tackling is uncommon in NFL camps due to fear of injury, but Glenn wants his team to be tough and calloused for the regular season. The Jets hadn't done it since Rex Ryan was the coach in 2010, their last playoff season. Several players said they hadn't done it since high school. For defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, it had a familiar feel.

""I've been coached by one of the greatest coaches of all time,"" said Williams, who played for Nick Saban at Alabama, ""and I kind of know how it looks and how it feels when it comes down to being around people who can take me and a team to the highest level. And [Glenn] has every aspect in him. I think he's going to be one of the greatest coaches in the league.""

AH YES, THE whistle. Not too many head coaches use them anymore. For Glenn, it's always around his neck, along with a red Sharpie for taking notes during practice.

The whistle symbolizes his connection to a bygone era, when pride and discipline were paramount. At 53, he's the oldest of the five first-time head coaches.

The players are ""in tune to [the whistle] right now,"" said Glenn, explaining his preference. ""So when this dude"" -- he blows the whistle -- ""they know what that means.""

HE SCORED POINTS with the players by starting practice at 8:30 a.m., about two hours earlier than last year. The temperatures were cooler in the morning than midday. The same couldn't be said for Glenn's passion.

His thermostat was on high most of the time, as he stalked, glared, exhorted and pushed his players. He stressed ""tempo"" and ""identity"" and ""discipline"" -- his favorite buzzwords. Almost every player, asked to describe Glenn, used the word ""intense."" The consensus among players: Practices were more competitive than in recent years.

IF GLENN SEES something, he says something. He doesn't hold criticism for later.

""He's not afraid of confrontation,"" said Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, a Glenn confidant who believes that's a necessary trait for a head coach.

Linebacker Marcelino McCrary-Ball experienced this firsthand. In the preseason opener against Green Bay, he was flagged for a late hit along the Packers' sideline. By the time he got back to the Jets' sideline -- he was removed for one play -- Glenn's ire had reached ignition.

He gave McCrary-Ball an earful, providing a video clip that delighted Jets' fans on social media. This is a fan base that never embraced former coach Robert Saleh's stoic demeanor on the sideline.

""It's amazing to see that he's holding the defense, offense and special teams to the same standard,"" defensive end Jermaine Johnson said of Glenn. ""What's even more impressive is how we respond. It gets fixed.""

Glenn's mission is to make the Jets a disciplined team. They led the league in accepted penalties in 2024, as he has noted on more than one occasion. Of course, saying and executing are two different things.

""The last coaching staff preached discipline,"" safety Tony Adams said, ""and we didn't listen to them.""

RAY MICKENS HAS known Glenn since 1992, when they were teammates at Texas A&M. They also played together on the Jets and have remained close. Two weeks ago, Mickens got goose bumps when he walked on the practice field and saw his friend for the first time as head coach of their old team.

His mind raced back to a conversation from 2013, when Glenn was just starting out as a scout for the Jets. Glenn, who lived in Houston, drove his Ford Explorer to schools all over the Midwest. On this day, he was headed to Iowa to check out a couple of prospects. He stopped at Mickens' home in Dallas.

Mickens was blown away that Glenn, a successful businessman in his post-playing days, would give it up for the tedious life of a scout. This, Glenn told him, was a necessary step toward achieving his ultimate goal -- head coach.

""I saw the work he put in a long time ago,"" Mickens said. ""So when I see him out there now, knowing all it took for him to get here ... that's what gives me goose bumps.""

GLENN, WHO MADE his last tackle as a player in 2008, tackled his boss one morning during the first week of camp. Well, sort of.

In between drills, Glenn snuck up behind owner Woody Johnson and playfully wrapped his arms around him.

""I'm going to get you before you get me this time,"" a smiling Glenn, mic'd up by the in-house media team, told Johnson.

That snapshot captures their relationship, which began 25 years ago when Glenn was playing for the Jets and Johnson was a first-year owner. None of Glenn's recent predecessors had that kind of bond with Johnson.

This, people close to the situation believe, will create harmony in the organization -- a departure from last year's turmoil, which included the firings of Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas during the season.

GLENN IS SERIOUS-MINDED -- he was the same way as a player -- but he knows when to take his foot off the gas. During camp, the team took a quick trip to a theater near the Jets' facility in New Jersey, where they screened Spike Lee's new movie, ""Highest 2 Lowest.""

Rocking a Joe Namath throwback jersey, Lee was present and addressed the team. He was introduced by Glenn, who presented Lee with a No. 40 Jets jersey and said he expects the filmmaker to wear it whenever he attends a sporting event. (The 40 is a nod to Lee's production company, ""40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks."")

Lee, a devout New York Knicks fan, attends a lot of sporting events.

GLENN BEGAN EVERY news conference in camp the same way:

""Good morning.""

For the most part, he seemed comfortable with the media, providing engaging, sometimes revealing answers. But there's a gruff side to his personality, and he occasionally gets snippy if he doesn't like the subject matter.

A few days before facing the New York Giants, he was asked about his plan for playing starters -- a routine question posed in every city across the league during the preseason. ""The plan is the plan,"" he said curtly. ""That's the plan. Next question.""

THE BLEACHERS WERE filled with more than 2,000 fans for the first public practice. During the team stretch, the crowd broke out into its celebrated chant: ""J-E-T-S! Jets! Jets! Jets!""

For Glenn, intimately familiar with the reprise from his time as a player, it was like listening to an old song that triggers sweet memories. He got choked up as he walked the stretch lines. Singularly focused on the job for seven months -- through the rigors of free agency, the draft and the offseason program -- this was the first time he truly felt the emotion of being home.

After practice, he gathered his players and shared those sentiments with them, showing the softer side to a hard-edged coach.

""I don't know why, fellas: Man, it hit me, and it hit me pretty hard,"" Glenn told reporters. ""I just felt grateful, grateful to be in this position.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0819%2Fr1533819_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 11:10:06.884610

The study analyzed self-reported data using the Phreesia PatientInsights survey, which patients completed after check-in at their doctor’s office. Patients who indicated they had a diagnosis of or were receiving treatment for COPD were included in the study. The survey asked questions about the individual’s symptoms and the impact of those symptoms on their daily life. Questions also focused on education about COPD, communications with their healthcare provider, and their treatment journey.

Of 1,615 patients who completed the survey, 39% had lived with COPD for more than seven years, and 25% said they experienced COPD-related symptoms every day in a typical month. While nearly two-thirds of respondents (64%) said COPD had a moderate or great impact on their daily lives, only 45% had spoken in detail to their health care providers about their COPD.

“Continuous communication between people with COPD and their health care provider is essential to help improve their quality of life, particularly when discussing treatments and understanding COPD and its symptoms,” said David M. Mannino, M.D, lead author of the study and chief medical officer of the COPD Foundation. “Our study suggests that patients who communicate with their providers have better symptom and disease management, which can reduce future exacerbations and hospital visits.

This report provides an overview and analysis of the current state of stablecoins. It examines the size of the crypto and stablecoin markets on a global and country level and highlights some of the key players already active in this space. In addition, it examines some key innovations and challenges for wider stablecoin implementation.

The report also explores future opportunities for banking and payments providers and discusses the key factors that will influence the stablecoin space going forward.

Stablecoins' momentum of moving from just a store of value to a medium of exchange will accelerate in 2025 as use cases diversify. Incumbent providers increasingly look at ways to implement stablecoins as specialized players emerge at different parts of the value chain, ensuring interoperability between blockchains, TradFi - DeFi, as well as different jurisdictions, which is a key strategic priority for achieving mainstream stablecoin use.

A key barrier to stablecoins to date is the lack of integration and conversion capabilities, which if not tackled also bears the risk of creating a closed-loop system that further fragments the value chain instead of improving on its interoperability.

Report Scope

The total value of P2P stablecoin wallet transactions globally has overtaken both cash and cheques transactions, with $8.5 trillion in stablecoins sent in 2024, but traditional rails outpace stablecoin payment volumes by an overwhelming margin.

The US and the UK had the two largest year-on-year increases in crypto holding, in both relative and absolute terms, alongside other Western markets. Crypto holders in Singapore, the US, and China use these the most for making payments.

Updated 2 hours ago

A man has pleaded guilty to murdering a customer inside a branch of Lloyds Bank in Derby.

Haybe Cabdiraxmaan Nur, 47, of Western Road, Derby, was charged with the fatal stabbing of Gurvinder Johal, 37, who was killed inside the St Peter's Street branch just after 14:30 BST on Tuesday 6 May.

Appearing in the dock at Derby Crown Court, Cabdiraxmaan Nur had a Somali interpreter as he entered his guilty plea in front of Mr Johal's family and friends sitting in the public gallery.

Judge Shaun Smith KC set a provisional sentencing date of 29 October.

The court was told Cabdiraxmaan Nur will serve a ""life sentence"" with a starting point of 25 years, ""subject to mitigating and aggravating factors"".

Turning to the defendant, the judge said: ""You will be sentenced on 29 October for this offence, you will receive a life sentence.

""The term that you will be required to spend in prison will be decided on that date, until then, you are remanded into custody.""

Mr Johal had been at Lloyds with the bank holiday takings from his Hen and Chickens Bar and Grill in Shelton Lock, a family friend said.

He had just returned to Derby from a family trip to India with his wife, children and extended family.

Det Insp Tony Owen, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said he was ""pleased that Mr Johal's family will not have to sit through a trial now that Nur has admitted this offence"".

Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor, Crown Prosecution Service East Midlands, added: ""This was a truly shocking crime, committed in broad daylight in a busy city centre bank.

""While the whole community has been affected by this happening in their midst, our thoughts and profound sympathies are with Mr Johal's family, friends and loved ones.""

In a news release on Thursday, the pharma announced that it has entered into a 10-year agreement with Fujifilm for a 160,000-square-foot production plant in North Carolina, where J&J’s previous investment focused and where much of other pharmas’ U.S. manufacturing boosts have landed. The new investment will create around 120 new jobs in the region, according to J&J, adding to the 500 positions associated with the March move. On Thursday, the pharma provided an update for this investment, revealing that construction is ongoing for its facility in Wilson, North Carolina.

Despite already having more manufacturing sites in the U.S. than in any other country, J&J continues “to strengthen our presence here,” CEO Joaquin Duato said in a prepared statement on Thursday.

This latest investment package comes amid Trump’s looming pharma tariffs, which he has been threatening the industry with for around six months now. Most recently, Trump earlier this month told CNBC that levies on pharma imports could reach as high as 250%, though he plans to implement this in phases. The industry, for instance, would first be subject to a “small tariff” before ramping up to 150%, then 250%.

A few days earlier, Trump reached a trade deal with the European Union, under which pharma products will carry a 15% tariff.

In parallel, the Trump administration also has an ongoing Section 232 national security investigation into pharma imports. Launched in April under Secretary Howard Lutnick’s Department of Commerce, the probe is set to run for 270 days, according to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, after which a report should be filed to the president, who then can impose certain trade restrictions, including tariffs.

According to an Aug. 14 report from Reuters, Lutnick had said the probe would end last month, before pushing back his own timeline by two weeks on July 29. But in that same article, Reuters cited industry, White House and European government sources, who said that tariffs are likely still weeks away. The government official from Europe even noted that tariffs could be delayed until next month, while also warning that timelines could change again.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/05a7b04/2147483647/strip/true/crop/622x350+3+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb2%2Fda6b464c44d48f5a547394bd4388%2Frsz-istock-1396614976-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 11:10:13.028082

Bearish Engulfing: Internal diagnostic score 7.30/10 — suggests a possible reversal to the upside.","Market Snapshot

Headline Takeaway: Ecolab (ECL) is showing a price rise of 5.82% recently, but technical indicators suggest a weak trend and market volatility.

While the fundamentals and analyst ratings remain strong, traders should remain cautious due to conflicting signals in the technical analysis.

News Highlights

Safex Chemicals' New Manufacturing Facility: This development could indirectly benefit Ecolab, as increased production in the chemical sector may drive demand for water treatment and hygiene solutions. The new facility is scalable to 80 MT/day and will create jobs.

U.S. China Trade Restrictions: New export restrictions on chemicals and other key tech products to China could impact Ecolab, as it operates in industrial and chemical markets. Watch for ripple effects in supply chain and demand dynamics.

ETF Growth in Asia Pacific: The Asia Pacific ETF industry hit a record $1.25 trillion in assets at the end of April. This could reflect broader investor confidence in chemical and industrial stocks like Ecolab in the region.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab is currently backed by strong analyst sentiment and fundamental performance. The simple average rating is 4.00, while the performance-weighted rating is 5.47. This indicates that more weight is given to analysts with strong historical performance, aligning with the stock's recent 5.82% price increase.

Rating Consistency: Analyst ratings are varied: ""Strong Buy,"" ""Buy,"" and ""Neutral."" However, the overall market expectation is optimistic, with a weighted match to the current price trend.

Key Fundamental Factors:

Return on Assets (ROA): 2.23% (model score: 2)

Return on Equity (ROE): 5.65% (model score: 3)

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 13.13% (model score: 3)

Cash-to-Market Value (Cash-MV): -54.01% (model score: 1)

These values suggest Ecolab maintains solid profitability, but the low Cash-MV score raises a caution flag for liquidity or valuation concerns.

Money-Flow Trends

Ecolab is currently attracting positive inflows across all fund categories. The overall inflow ratio is 51.22%, indicating that money is predominantly flowing into the stock rather than out.

Big-Money Influence: The block inflow ratio is 51.25%, showing strong institutional confidence.

Retail Participation: Small, medium, and large investors are also showing net inflows, with the smallest group contributing a 50.29% inflow ratio.

Fund Flow Score: Ecolab's internal diagnostic score is 7.85/10, which is categorized as ""good"" in terms of fund flow momentum.

Key Technical Signals

Technical analysis of Ecolab over the past five days shows a weak trend and mixed signals. The technical score is 4.08/10, reflecting caution in the current environment.

WR Overbought: Internal diagnostic score 7.04/10 — suggests moderate bullish potential.

RSI Overbought: Internal diagnostic score 1.00/10 — strong bearish signal.

Bearish Engulfing: Internal diagnostic score 7.30/10 — suggests a possible reversal to the upside.

Marubozu White: Internal diagnostic score 1.00/10 — strong bearish signal.

Recent Chart Patterns: Over the last five days, key signals appeared on different dates:

August 13: WR Overbought and RSI Overbought

August 15: WR Overbought

August 19: WR Overbought and Marubozu White

August 18: WR Overbought and Bearish Engulfing

These mixed signals reinforce the volatile nature of Ecolab's price movement.

The government published a notice on its website on 18 August seeking one or more commercial partners to “identify, extract, analyse and present departmental finance and performance data in near real-time”.

This follows a speech by chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones in March, who set out plans to overhaul how the department uses data to measure performance in line with prime minister Keir Starmer’s objective to improve efficiency and deliver more effective services.

“I am convinced that through investment and reform, we can deliver a more productive and agile state that delivers better outcomes for people and reduces the cost of running public services,” Jones said at the time.

“That’s why as part of my wider reforms to public spending, HM Treasury will be using technology to analyse finance and performance data in real time and free up departments to focus on delivery instead of Treasury compliance reporting.”

The preliminary market engagement notice – designed to give suppliers time to prepare in advance of a tender – stated that “central to this vision is more collaboration and transparency between departments and the centre of government, requiring a greater level of sharing and harmonising of key datasets”.

Work to achieve this also ties in with the Shared Services Strategy for Government, which aims to implement a range of shared service clusters and “consolidate a fragmented landscape” of finance and HR enterprise resource planning systems.

The intent is to build the necessary IT infrastructure to extract, transform and load data from these cluster systems, encompassing current legacy and new IT systems and centrally held Microsoft Office datasets.

The solution procured from the private sector would need to have good governance and control “baked in”, the government said, stating that “security will be paramount”.

It said the work is best suited to a small- or medium-sized enterprise.

Security, flexibility, and potential for AI

The notice said the system would need to translate, standardise and harmonise data with other existing datasets, and then present it “in a flexible and intuitive way to a wide range of users… [through] capable reporting suites”.

It also said that the Treasury would require support to deliver a business change process to upskill the civil servants using it so they can “engage on the opportunities” it presents.

While the notice said there is not currently an explicit need to use artificial intelligence, the Treasury “is exploring and is open to the use of AI capabilities” to enable the solution to be scaled up efficiently.

It added that long term flexibility and agility would be vital to allow for new datasets to be ingested as they come online, or to expand the scope of data collection to entities – such as local government or arm’s length bodies – not currently included in the scope for the shared service programmes.

Explainer: Arm’s length bodies, such as NHS England, deliver vital public services using public funding and are accountable to ministers but operate independently of direct government control.

The government said the Treasury intends to undertake a small scale pilot towards the end of 2025 to help build the business case, and that there may be opportunities for vendors to engage in small scale, low cost pilots to demonstrate capabilities and suitability.

The contract with one or more chosen suppliers is estimated to last from early July 2026 to the end of March 2028.

Driving modernisation and productivity

In his speech at the Institute for Government think tank in March, Darren Jones said the plan was inspired by the private sector and would make it easier for government to understand progress that is being made at a programme and project level.

Currently, government departments – which under the UK’s constitutional arrangements are autonomous, independent organisations that report directly to parliament – track their own spending and performance, and share data with the Treasury via manual uploads in online spreadsheets and physical letters.

Jones said this means the Treasury does not have real time access to finance and performance management data from across government, and cannot see in real time departmental spending and its impact.

Under the current system, “it’s a wonder that anything gets done,” he said.

The planned data platform and other reforms would give government “the tools, the data and the insight to really be able to drive modernisation and productivity across the public sector so that we’re operating as a modern government fit for the 21st century”, he said.",https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-08-21_UK-Treasury-integrated-performance-data_finance-data_CREDIT-Jakub-Zerdzicki-via-Pexels-620x414.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 16:12:30.158091

The mine is facing a potential closure, putting 688 jobs — and the livelihoods of hundreds of workers—at risk. This development threatens severe economic consequences for the region.

Retrenchment notice issued

Assmang has issued a Section 189(3) notice under the Labour Relations Act, indicating its intention to begin consultations on the possible retrenchment of 688 employees.

The retrenchments stem from the financial difficulties of ArcelorMittal South Africa, the mine’s sole major client.

Assmang shuts Cato Ridge Smelter in KZN; 600 jobs at risk

NUM has described this as more than a corporate decision. “The closure of Beeshoek Mine would deal a severe blow to the local community, and we will not stand by while nearly 700 jobs are erased with the stroke of a pen,” the union stated.

NUM’s position and demands

“Our top priority is to protect the jobs, dignity, and futures of our members. Retrenchment must be a last resort — not a default option,” NUM emphasised.

The union is demanding full transparency from Assmang, including:

A clear commercial justification for the proposed retrenchments and why alternatives were rejected.

Reasons for considering “Care and Maintenance” instead of closure.

A precise count of affected employees.

The anticipated impact on the community and long-term outsourced contracts.

Details on severance pay, selection criteria, and benefits (including medical aid and long-term policies).

Exploring alternatives

NUM will engage in consultations to push for viable alternatives, such as:

Freezing recruitment and overtime

Redeployment within Assmang or other ARM joint ventures

Offering reskilling opportunities and voluntary separation packages

The union also expects the employer to provide robust social support measures for affected workers. “No worker will face this process alone,” NUM stated.

They further reminded Assmang that the consultation must be meaningful and in good faith, warning that any attempt to undermine it will face legal challenge through the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration or Labour Court.

Next steps

NUM will participate fully in the consultation process and is prepared to oppose any unfair retrenchments. Members will be updated continuously. If necessary, collective action will be considered.

The union also urged the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to fulfil its oversight obligations under Section 52 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA).",https://www.miningreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-77-2-1024x768.png,N,,2025-08-21 12:58:36.437249

Ltd., a joint venture between Yakult Honsha in Japan and Groupe Danone in France, announces the appointment of Bollywood star Taapsee Pannu as its new brand ambassador. Strengthening its commitment to promoting gut health, the company also revealed its goal of achieving double-digit growth every year until 2030.

Since its entry in 2008, Yakult has expanded to nearly 700 cities, creating awareness around probiotics and gut health. With a growing preference for healthier food and beverage choices, the demand for probiotics and functional foods is rising, making the country a key market for Yakult’s growth strategy.

Taapsee Pannu, Bollywood Actor, Yakult Brand Ambassador said, “I’m really happy to be part of Yakult’s journey in promoting good gut health. My family has been enjoying Yakult for years, especially my mom, and I’ve seen first-hand how small, consistent habits can make a big difference. I truly believe that good health starts in the gut, and Yakult is such an easy, tasty way to include that in our daily routine. I’m excited to help spread this message and encourage more people across India to embrace a healthier lifestyle.”

Eiji Amano, Managing Director, Yakult Danone India Pvt. Ltd. said, “India has shown remarkable growth potential for Yakult over the last 17 years. From a nascent category in 2008 to a rapidly expanding market today, Yakult has continuously won consumer trust and Our next milestone of achieving double-digit growth every year until 2030 reflects the growing demand for probiotics and the confidence we have in the Indian market. Yakult stands committed to reaching more families with our scientifically backed probiotic drink.”

Dr. Neerja Hajela, CSO – Science and Regulatory Affairs, Yakult Danone India Pvt. Ltd. said, “Yakult is a daily catalyst that improves the effectiveness of our diet by enhancing the absorption of nutrients in the gut. This is because only Yakult contains the unique Shirota strain, clinically proven to increase the good bacteria in the gut, thereby boosting absorption and digestion. Yakult ensures effective delivery and consistent health benefits.”

Taku Otsuka, Director – Sales, PR & Marketing, Yakult Danone India Pvt. Ltd. said, “Our mission goes beyond just selling products. We want to spark a conversation about gut health and make it part of everyday life for people across the country. Through innovative marketing, on-ground activities, and meaningful engagement with our consumers, Yakult aims to make probiotics a simple, daily habit for every Indian household. After all, good health starts from within, and we want everyone to feel that difference every day.”

India’s probiotics drink market is valued at around INR 1,348.8 Million in 2024 and is expected to reach nearly INR 5,778.9 Million by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 16.67% between 2025 and 2033, as per IMARC Group.

A unique strength in Yakult’s journey has been the “Yakult Ladies” home delivery model. Specially trained women deliver Yakult directly to households, ensuring freshness and credibility, while educating families about gut health. This initiative also provides financial independence and confidence to hundreds of women across cities.

Yakult contains over 6.5 billion beneficial bacteria per serving, specifically Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, which helps improve digestion and boost immunity. Originating in Japan, it is now sold in 40 countries and regions.

As functional foods and probiotics gain preference for preventive wellness, improved immunity, and long-term health, Yakult, backed by 90 years of scientific research, is positioned to make probiotics a daily habit for households.",https://mediabrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-Yakult-Appoints-Taapsee-Pannu-as-Brand-Ambassador-to-Drive-2030-Growth-Vision-MediaBrief.png,N,,2025-08-21 13:00:35.618489

While not mathematically out of the title race, the veteran German driver said they’re not giving up on the championship just yet.

This weekend will mark a return visit to the 3.27-mile Virginia circuit for Rockenfeller, who has never finished off the podium at the track in his three previous appearances.

“We saw last year as well that it’s pretty cool for us to battle just amongst us and basically focus on our own category, try for overall victory,” he said.

“I’s going to be tough. It’s a place where every mistake, you may get really penalized, especially if the grass is still wet.

“We tested there last week and the weather wasn’t perfect. But anyway, it’s a challenging track and I hope we can do well.

“We have had so far had pretty a good season. Of course, you always want to do better.

“Luckily, the last race we had a podium finish, second in Road America. And hopefully we can carry that momentum into VIR and use what we learned last week.

“It’s IMSA, [so] you never know. It’s always up and down and strategy is key so we have to execute well.”

When asked what he thinks has been the biggest improvement to the program this year, Rockenfeller believes it’s been the team’s level of execution, particularly in terms of strategy and on pit lane.

“I think the main focus was this year on execution, which I think we as a team have done a much better job compared to last year,” he said.

“We’re more experienced, you know everybody much more and you work on your weaknesses.

“Still, we had, I would say, one or two races where we could have done better. But I think all the other races we got the maximum amount of our package.

“It’s also a question of where you are balanced in the field and then that’s sometimes very difficult.

“But anyway, our focus is on execution, and we are not far from the leaders in the championship with three more rounds to go.”

Rockenfeller added: “We think race by race. Our sister car won Daytona. We were on the podium there as well. We had a great start to the year and I think you clearly can see an improvement.

“We were fighting for podiums and victories and in some races, so [we’re] very happy. But we know it’s tough in IMSA and you have to be very consistent and unfortunately, we had one or the other race on our side where we were not good enough.

“When you finish P-last then of course, it’s tough; it’s big points you lose. Let’s see where we can finish. Still, everything is possible, so we never give up, that’s for sure.”",https://sportscar365.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BB_RA_8_3_25_22184.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 10:06:49.997854
ID33,Ralph Lauren,2025-08-21 12:36:55+00:00,www.nytimes.com,"Europe Gets a Written Trump Trade Deal, With a Caveat for Automakers","Tony Romm, Jeanna Smialek, www.nytimes.com, tony-romm, jeanna-smialek",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/eu-us-trump-trade-deal.html,"But that deal was a handshake arrangement, and negotiators have been scrambling ever since to put it into writing.
Its backbone remains unchanged: The United States will maintain a 15 percent tariff on most goods arriving from E.U.
The United States will not immediately relax for Europe tariffs it has imposed worldwide on foreign-made vehicles, currently set to 27.5 percent for European carmakers.
Rather, the two sides agreed that the United States would lower those tariffs to 15 percent only after Europe takes steps to follow through on its commitments to lower tariffs on imported American goods.
Under the deal, Europe agreed to purchase $750 billion in American energy, while increasing its investment in the United States by more than $600 billion.","The United States and the European Union on Thursday published much-anticipated details of the trade agreement they struck verbally last month, which will see Washington maintain high tariffs on vehicles imported from the 27-nation bloc until it takes steps to lower its levies on many American industrial and agricultural products.

The terms, outlined in a joint statement released by two of the world’s largest and most intertwined economies, set of a clearer framework for a truce announced in July that averted a damaging tit-for-tat escalation in President Trump’s punishing global trade war.

But that deal was a handshake arrangement, and negotiators have been scrambling ever since to put it into writing. European officials have been eager for a formal document, hoping that it would solidify promises that the administration had made to spare the bloc from worse outcomes. The newly published version is not a legally enforceable pact, but it is a step toward one.

Its backbone remains unchanged: The United States will maintain a 15 percent tariff on most goods arriving from E.U. member countries, a rate that Mr. Trump officially imposed in an executive order that took effect earlier this month.

In a win for Europe, that rate applies to some of its biggest exports, including pharmaceuticals, many of which will remain taxed at 15 percent even after the United States finalizes an expected set of tariffs for foreign-made medicines that could be as high as 200 percent.

Mr. Trump has looked to impose the duties on pharmaceuticals separately, and globally, on national security grounds, with additional tariffs planned for other critical sectors such as computer chips and lumber. But Europe will be spared from those higher rates as well, the two sides committed on Thursday.

Cars are more complicated. The United States will not immediately relax for Europe tariffs it has imposed worldwide on foreign-made vehicles, currently set to 27.5 percent for European carmakers. Rather, the two sides agreed that the United States would lower those tariffs to 15 percent only after Europe takes steps to follow through on its commitments to lower tariffs on imported American goods.

Specifically, the bloc must “formally” introduce legislation that would relax duties on industrial goods and agricultural products, including bison, tree nuts, dairy and many types of seafood, before lower car levies will kick in.

The delay could upset European automakers, who have faced steep financial losses for months as a result of America’s high car tariffs.

But a White House official, who briefed reporters in advance on condition of anonymity, said that Washington hoped this could be addressed in a matter of weeks, with tariffs lowered retroactively to the beginning of the month that the E.U. is able to take action.

Maros Sefcovic, the E.U.’s trade commissioner, said that the bloc was determined to start the legislative process this month, so lower car tariffs will eventually be counted as having started on Aug. 1.

The release of the joint statement on Thursday is a critical step in what has been a weekslong back and forth between negotiators on both sides of the Atlantic, as European officials made a last-ditch effort to secure additional tariff relief, particularly on wine and spirits. In the end, they did not succeed, and taxes on those imports remain at 15 percent. Before this year, alcohol tariffs had generally been held at zero.

The written agreement acknowledges that the bare-bones deal is “a first step in a process that can be further expanded over time to cover additional areas.”

The statement was greeted warmly in Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the E.U.’s executive branch, the European Commission, praised it on social media as a move toward “stability in the largest trading partnership in the world.”

In many ways, the documents that the two governments produced also evinced the even tougher haggling still on the horizon if they hope to strike a more formal trade deal, an undertaking usually years in the making. U.S. and European officials agreed to continue discussions on a vast array of thorny trade issues, including adjustments to auto and emissions standards and a reduction in regulations on U.S. technology companies, all of which have long rankled policymakers in Washington.

Europeans have insisted that they will not water down their key digital regulations, painting the issue as a matter of sovereignty. But the White House continues to push for them to weaken rules that govern online speech on big platforms in particular, criticizing the regulations for going too far to censor content and for causing undue burden to American technology companies.

Before clinching their trade truce, the two sides appeared primed for a devastating standoff, with Mr. Trump threatening tariffs on Europe of 30 percent, and the regional bloc considering a set of retaliatory measures, which the White House had promised to combat in kind.

They reached their deal partly because European emissaries appealed to Mr. Trump with promises of significant new U.S. investments, adopting a tactic that other countries have also used to lessen the blow of U.S. tariffs. Under the deal, Europe agreed to purchase $750 billion in American energy, while increasing its investment in the United States by more than $600 billion.

It quickly became clear that officials in Brussels saw the commitments more as aspirations than hard targets, given the fact that they would come from private sources that were not controlled by the European Commission. On Thursday, U.S. and E.U. officials appeared to acknowledge as much in their joint statement, which did not include further details on the investments or the way in which Washington might enforce the terms.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21dc-eu-trade-zqjp/21dc-eu-trade-zqjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 09:07:42.717051

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) pulled back roughly 0.4%, while those on the S&P 500 (ES=F) moved down 0.3%. Contracts on the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) dropped nearly 0.4%, as the exodus from tech stocks eased.

Walmart (WMT) capped the week's earnings from retail giants, raising its full-year forecast for sales and profit after its second quarter results showed its low-price push was drawing in shoppers. But its quarterly profit fell short of high expectations, and its shares slipped in premarket trading.

Meanwhile, a continued slide in Big Tech stocks is still a worry, even after the Nasdaq on Wednesday showed signs of a reprieve, coming firmly off session lows as buyers jumped in. Short sellers have reaped over $5 billion from bets against techs as AI fears rippled through markets.

Dimmed rate-cut hopes are also weighing on minds after minutes from the Fed's July meeting signaled that sticky inflation rather than a faltering labor market is the main concern for policymakers. There was broad support for holding rates steady, despite a growing divide at the Fed.

Amid that rate debate, jobless claims for the week ending Aug. 15 rose to 235,000, versus expectations for 225,000. Continuing claims jumped to 1.97 million, a notch above the 1.96 million anticipated by economists.

The Fed kicks off its Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers from around the world later on Thursday, with the countdown on to Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech on Friday. The gathering is taking place as President Trump puts public pressure on the Fed, most recently calling for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign. Cook has said she won't be ""bullied to step down"".

First, he spent time with NBA legend Steph Curry at the Curry Camp and then he went to the Nike Skills Academy.
Steph doesn’t just do that for anybody,” Greg Williams said.
But they actually hope to do it again.” Greg Williams said his son was not intimidated working with Curry.
“I met a lot of people, too, and made a lot of great connections,” Greg Williams said.","Kam Williams was not a “big name” transfer when he was the first addition to Kentucky coach Mark Pope’s 2025-26 roster after an impressive freshman season at Tulane.

However, the 6-foot-8 wing has become a hot name who has been projected already as a possible first round NBA Draft pick in 2026 and has drawn praise from Pope not only for his 3-point shooting but also his defense.

Williams spent part of his two-week break from UK in California working on his skills. First, he spent time with NBA legend Steph Curry at the Curry Camp and then he went to the Nike Skills Academy.

Octagon Basketball, which represents both Curry and Williams along with former UK player/NBA All-Star Bam Adebayo, helped arrange for Williams to learn from the NBA’s best long-range shooter.

Greg Williams calls his son “Chocolate Steph Curry” and knew it was a rare opportunity for his son, who shot 41.2 percent from 3 last season, to learn from Curry, a career 42 percent shooter from 3 in his 16-year NBA career.

“He’s on a lot of radars. Steph doesn’t just do that for anybody,” Greg Williams said. “We knew in advance Kam would get this opportunity. We just had to make the logistics work.

“Kam said Steph did everything full speed. No catch and shoot drills. Everything was movement. He was big on teaching you to keep moving at all times. It’s one thing to see him on TV but when you are right there with him Kam said it is non-stop action.

“It was the insights he gave Kam not just about basketball but also about life and enjoying all the moments he can. That is the GOAT working with Kam, so it was kind of crazy. But they actually hope to do it again.”

Greg Williams said his son was not intimidated working with Curry.

“Kam has been shooting all his life and once he gets locked in on the drill it’s not like you are there with Steph Curry but it was him against the drill and trying to do well and not focusing on who he was doing it with,” Greg Williams said.

Going straight to the Nike Skills Academy was “tiring” but Greg Williams said a lot of NBA scouts got to see his son and “his name is buzzing” with the right people.

“I met a lot of people, too, and made a lot of great connections,” Greg Williams said. “There were players from Arkansas, Florida and Purdue, guys he will be seeing during the season. There were some very talented players there that were chosen for their NBA potential so to be part of that was very special and good for him.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1537/2025/08/20151210/screenshot-2025-08-20-at-3-11-51-pm-1024x547.png,N,,2025-08-21 11:11:32.632922

Retail Sector Volatility: A Macro and Micro Interplay The mid-cap consumer discretionary sector has experienced heightened volatility in 2025 due to: 1.
Conclusion: Balancing Strategy and Sentiment Best Buy's price-sensitive allocation strategy exemplifies the challenges and opportunities facing retailers in a volatile market.","In 2025, Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) has emerged as a case study in how retail stocks, particularly those in the mid-cap consumer discretionary sector, are increasingly shaped by real-time investor behavior and institutional positioning. The company's price-sensitive allocation strategy—designed to mitigate the impact of tariffs and preserve market share—has not only influenced its own stock performance but also reflected broader trends in institutional sentiment and retail sector volatility.

Best Buy's Five-Point Tariff Mitigation Plan

Best Buy's 2025 strategy to counteract rising tariffs and inflationary pressures is a multi-faceted approach that includes:

1. Manufacturing Flexibility: Reducing reliance on China (now 30–35% of COGS) by diversifying sourcing to Vietnam, India, and South Korea.

2. Vendor Negotiations: Consolidating volume with fewer partners to absorb tariff costs or optimize pricing.

3. Geographic Diversification: Encouraging suppliers to maintain dual manufacturing locations for key products.

4. Product Rationalization: Adjusting assortments to align with demand and reduce inefficiencies.

5. Price Caution: Implementing selective pricing and promotional changes while avoiding broad price hikes.

These measures aim to balance cost control with consumer affordability, a critical challenge in a market where price sensitivity has intensified due to inflation and economic uncertainty. However, the execution of this strategy has coincided with significant stock volatility, driven by institutional investor behavior and macroeconomic headwinds.

Institutional Positioning and Retail Stock Volatility

Best Buy's institutional ownership structure reveals a complex landscape of bullish and bearish signals. As of July 2025, 99.3% of its shares are held by institutions, with major stakeholders including BlackRock, Vanguard, and JPMorgan. Recent 13F filings show mixed activity:

- Bullish Shifts: Entities like Northern Trust Corp (19.58% increase in shares) and Andra AP-fonden (150.91% increase) have added to their positions.

- Bearish Adjustments: Richard M. Schulze (Best Buy's founder) reduced his stake by 44.62%, while Bank of America Corp trimmed both call and put positions, signaling caution.

The Fund Sentiment Score for Best Buy currently reflects moderate institutional activity, with a score below 50 indicating reduced accumulation compared to peers. This aligns with the company's revised 2025 guidance—revenue now projected at $41.1–$41.9 billion (down from $41.4–$42.2 billion)—and a stock price decline of 23.01% year-over-year.

The institutional put/call ratio further underscores bearish sentiment. Put options, which hedge against downside risk, have surged relative to call options, suggesting active managed funds are preparing for further volatility. This dynamic is not unique to Best Buy but reflects broader trends in the mid-cap consumer discretionary sector, where companies like Palantir Technologies and AppLovin have driven index performance through speculative bets, contrasting with Best Buy's more conservative approach.

Retail Sector Volatility: A Macro and Micro Interplay

The mid-cap consumer discretionary sector has experienced heightened volatility in 2025 due to:

1. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: High interest rates, inflation, and the potential for a U.S. recession have dampened consumer spending on big-ticket items.

2. Trade Policy Shifts: The Trump administration's 145% tariff on Chinese imports (later reduced to 30%) created uncertainty, forcing companies like Best Buy to adopt flexible sourcing strategies.

3. Institutional Style Biases: Active managers, such as the Baron Mid Cap Growth Strategy, have underperformed the Russell Midcap Growth Index by avoiding high-Beta and high-Momentum stocks—names that surged during the “risk on” market rebound in Q2 2025.

For Best Buy, this environment has amplified stock volatility. While its strategy to diversify supply chains and manage pricing is sound, the company's reliance on Asian manufacturing and its exposure to tariffs have made it a proxy for broader trade tensions. Institutional investors, meanwhile, are recalibrating portfolios to balance long-term growth potential with short-term risks.

Investment Implications and Strategic Considerations

For investors, Best Buy's stock presents a nuanced opportunity:

- Long-Term Resilience: The company's tariff mitigation plan and focus on product rationalization position it to weather supply chain disruptions. Its services segment, including membership deals, has already shown gross margin improvements.

- Short-Term Volatility: Institutional shifts and macroeconomic risks (e.g., potential U.S. recession, trade policy uncertainty) could continue to pressure the stock. The put/call ratio and Fund Sentiment Score suggest caution.

- Sector Divergence: While Best Buy's strategy is defensive, mid-cap consumer discretionary stocks with high-growth narratives (e.g., AI-driven tech firms) have outperformed. Investors must weigh Best Buy's operational discipline against the sector's speculative momentum.

Conclusion: Balancing Strategy and Sentiment

Best Buy's price-sensitive allocation strategy exemplifies the challenges and opportunities facing retailers in a volatile market. While its efforts to diversify sourcing and manage costs are prudent, the stock's performance remains intertwined with institutional sentiment and macroeconomic trends. For investors, the key lies in assessing whether Best Buy's long-term resilience can outpace near-term volatility—a question that will be answered as trade policies stabilize and consumer spending patterns evolve.

In a sector where institutional positioning and real-time investor behavior drive outcomes, Best Buy's journey offers valuable insights into the interplay between corporate strategy and market dynamics. As the company navigates these headwinds, its ability to maintain profitability while adapting to shifting trade and economic conditions will be critical to unlocking value for shareholders.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-21 10:06:30.861654

The vibe was aspirational in the wrong way, airbrushed, out of touch, and fading into backlash territory.

But just as the internet rolled its eyes at another glossy misstep, along came Katseye’s Gap campaign, soundtracked by Kelis’s Milkshake, with choreography that felt IG reel-ready yet authentic. It was playful, cool, and most importantly designed for the women who will actually wear the jeans, not just pose in them.

This clash of campaigns says everything about the way denim is shifting in 2025. No longer the stiff, hyper-sexualised ad format of the early aughts, Gen Z wants their denim served with personality, inclusivity, and a dose of fun.

Take Beyoncé’s Levi’s collaboration earlier this year: a cultural moment that merged music, movement, and a sense of power in denim. Or Jung Kook and Mingyu’s Calvin Klein campaigns, which went viral not just because of abs and smouldering gazes, but because they represented how global stars can reframe a heritage brand for a new generation. These campaigns worked because they felt lived-in, not manufactured.

Of course, none of this is new. Denim advertising has been stirring headlines for decades. From Brooke Shields’s infamous 1980 Calvin Klein campaign shot by Richard Avedon, where a teenage Shields declared, “Nothing comes between me and my Calvins”—to Cindy Crawford’s iconic denim moment jeans have always been about more than fabric. They’re symbols of rebellion, youth, sex appeal, and legacy. As more retrospective shows, the best denim ads are the ones that don’t just sell trousers, but bottle up an era’s energy—turning threads into cultural touchstones.

There are few garments as democratic, as enduring, and as endlessly reinterpreted as denim. Jeans have been worn by miners, rebels, supermodels, and pop idols, moving from dusty workwear to cultural shorthand for youth, sexuality, rebellion, and identity. Yet the way denim has been sold to us tells an even richer story. Advertising campaigns have not just mirrored fashion—they have shaped how generations have seen themselves, and how they’ve been seen by others. Welcome to the world of the denim gaze: a history of how jeans became a canvas for our desires, our defiance, and, increasingly, our individuality.

From Workwear to Symbol of Defiance

Levi Strauss may have patented riveted jeans for miners in the 1870s, but it was Hollywood that transformed denim into an attitude. By the 1950s, James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause in a Lee jeans and Marlon Brando in The Wild One turned jeans into a symbol of youthful rebellion.

Advertising quickly caught up. By the 1970s, denim campaigns leaned on this sense of defiance, pushing jeans as the uniform of counterculture. The rebel gaze was born—denim as shorthand for saying no to authority and yes to freedom.

The Provocative Eighties and Nineties

If the 1970s were about rebellion, the 1980s and ’90s were about provocation. Calvin Klein redefined the denim campaign—sometimes controversially, always memorably. Who can forget Brooke Shields’ 1980 line, “You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.” Or Kate Moss and Mark Wahlberg in the infamous 1992 ads, topless and tangled in their Calvins? Guess, too, mastered the art of cinematic seduction—Claudia Schiffer and Anna Nicole Smith appeared not just as models but as characters, cast in smoky, sultry stories.

Here, jeans were no longer the star. The body was. The erotic gaze dominated, denim framed the body as an object of desire, blurring the line between commodity and fantasy.

The Commercial Glut of the 2000s

By the 2000s, the formula had begun to wear thin. Denim was everywhere—Diesel, True Religion, American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch. Some, like Diesel, leaned into irony with clever, tongue-in-cheek campaigns that winked at the audience. But others fell into a glossy sameness.

American Eagle in particular struggled to cut through. Its campaigns, often staged to mimic “relatable” youth culture, felt curated rather than lived in. The brand’s attempts at inclusivity sometimes seemed performative, models styled for catalogue appeal instead of authenticity. For a generation beginning to demand more transparency and honesty, this rang hollow. If Calvin Klein’s provocation had been too much, American Eagle’s soft-focus relatability was, simply, not enough. The commercial gaze, denim as oversaturated commodity—was uninspiring, and consumers turned away.

The New Denim Icons: Gen Z Global Takeover

In the 2020s, denim has undergone another reinvention, one led not by anonymous models but by cultural icons with devoted fandoms. Calvin Klein, once the enfant terrible of denim advertising, found fresh life by casting Jung Kook of BTS and Mingyu of SEVENTEEN. Fans didn’t just consume the ads; they shared them, dissected them, embodied them. Unlike the provocative shock of the 1990s, these campaigns rely on authenticity and charisma. Sex appeal is still there, but reframed, it’s about confidence, artistry, and connection.

Gap, too, has struck gold with its 2025 campaign featuring KATSEYE, the global pop girl group coming from the same label as BTS. Unlike American Eagle’s over-curated shoots, Gap let KATSEYE do what Gen Z does best: move. The campaign is full of choreography, Y2K nostalgia, group energy. The jeans are for the women wearing them, not for the viewer’s gaze. That’s what makes it work.

Each stage tells us more about society than about denim itself. From defiance to desire, from overexposure to authenticity, denim has mirrored our shifting cultural values. In this new era, denim advertising no longer asks, How do you want to be seen? Instead, it asks, Who do you want to be?

The U.S. cosmetics group has closed the year confirming the decline in business that has been dragging on since the beginning of the fiscal year.

Since mid-April, Coty has been immersed in a restructuring plan aimed at optimizing resources, accelerating processes and strengthening margins.

Expectations for a European interest rate cut in September weakened due to persistent inflationary pressures facing European Central Bank policymakers.
• Money market pricing shows the probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in September remains below 30%.
Markets are looking for signals on the likelihood of a September rate cut.
Japanese Interest Rates • Market pricing for a 25-basis point Bank of Japan rate hike in September remains steady near 40%.","The US dollar fell on Thursday as investors awaited monetary policy signals from the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, while concerns over central bank independence resurfaced following the latest attack from President Donald Trump.

The euro and the pound steadied at $1.1652 and $1.3451 respectively, while the yen and the Swiss franc posted minor losses.

Odds of a Fed rate cut next month eased slightly to 82%, offering limited support to the dollar. Focus remained on whether Chair Jerome Powell would counter market expectations for a September cut in his speech on Friday.

Kenneth Broux, head of corporate FX and rates research at Société Générale, said: “The risks are skewed. Because the market has already priced in a cut, the danger is reverting back to a 50-50 scenario.” He noted this could trigger selling in short-dated Treasuries and push the dollar higher.

Meanwhile, Trump’s call for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign — based on allegations from a political ally — revived investor worries over his attempts to influence the central bank. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for being “too slow” to cut rates, and urged his resignation, while admitting that the Fed’s unique legal structure prevents firing board members over policy disputes.

Prashant Newnaha, senior APAC rates strategist at TD Securities, said: “These developments could raise questions about the Fed’s supervisory and regulatory functions, but they carry almost no immediate impact on monetary policy.” He added this explained the relatively calm FX reaction, as the dollar initially slipped before trimming losses and moving higher.

Investors expect Trump to replace Powell, whose term ends in May, with a more dovish candidate. Earlier this month, Trump announced he would nominate Council of Economic Advisers chair Steven Miran to fill a vacant Fed seat after Adriana Kugler’s surprise resignation.

The dollar index rose 0.1% to 98.337, set for a 0.4% weekly gain. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.30%, while the 2-year yield, more sensitive to policy, edged higher to 3.756%.

Some analysts cautioned markets may be disappointed by Powell’s speech on Friday, highlighting lingering uncertainty over the inflationary impact of Trump’s tariffs.

Elsewhere, Norway’s krone rose 0.4% versus the dollar and 0.5% versus the euro after stronger-than-expected non-oil GDP growth in Q2, alongside an upward revision to Q1 data.

In China, investor bets against the yuan climbed to their highest since mid-May, fueled by rising economic concerns, according to a Reuters survey released Thursday.

In crypto markets, Bitcoin slipped 0.6% to $113,741, while Ether dropped 1.6% to $4,285.89.

Gold prices declined in the European market on Thursday, resuming losses that had briefly paused yesterday, once again approaching a three-week low under pressure from a stronger US dollar against a basket of global currencies.

Later today, the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium kicks off, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak tomorrow, Friday. His remarks are expected to provide strong clues regarding the path of monetary easing and interest rate cuts during the remainder of this year.

Price Overview

Gold prices today: Gold fell by 0.4% to $3,334.35 per ounce, from the opening level of $3,348.42, after hitting an intraday high of $3,352.13.

At Wednesday’s settlement, gold gained 1.0% in its first increase in three sessions, after earlier touching a three-week low at $3,311.58 per ounce.

US Dollar

The US Dollar Index rose 0.1% on Thursday, resuming gains that had briefly halted yesterday, reaching a two-week high of 98.44 points and reflecting strength in the greenback against a basket of major and minor currencies.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook reiterated her commitment to her post despite President Donald Trump’s calls for her resignation over alleged mortgage fraud.

Minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting revealed divisions over concerns regarding tariffs, inflation, and the labor market.

US Interest Rates

According to the CME FedWatch Tool: market pricing of a 25 basis-point rate cut in September remains steady at 81%, with a 19% probability assigned to rates staying unchanged.

For the October meeting, markets are pricing a 91% chance of a 25 basis-point cut, versus a 9% chance of no change.

To reassess these probabilities, investors are awaiting key US sector data due later today for August.

Jackson Hole

Central bankers from around the world will attend the symposium beginning later today, though market attention will remain focused on Powell’s speech tomorrow, as traders look for signals on the likelihood of a US rate cut in September.

Gold Outlook

Brian Lan, managing director at Singapore-based GoldSilver Central, said: “We don’t think gold prices will rise significantly, and we see them stabilizing for now.”

He added: “Even if rates are cut slightly, we may see a modest uptick in gold, with $3,400 as a possible level. Otherwise, prices may continue to stabilize or dip slightly, approaching $3,300.”

SPDR Gold Trust

Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed ETF, fell by 4 metric tons yesterday, marking a second consecutive daily decline. Total holdings dropped to 958.21 metric tons, the lowest since August 6.

The euro declined in European trading on Thursday against a basket of global currencies, resuming losses after a temporary pause yesterday versus the US dollar, and approaching its lowest level in a week. This comes as renewed demand for the dollar continues, with investors viewing it as the best available investment.

Expectations for a European interest rate cut in September weakened due to persistent inflationary pressures facing European Central Bank policymakers. To reassess those expectations, investors await the release of key sector data in Europe for August later today.

Price Overview

• EUR/USD fell 0.1% to $1.1641 from the opening price of $1.1651, with a session high at $1.1655.

• The euro ended Wednesday’s session with less than a 0.1% gain against the dollar, its first in three days, after touching a one-week low of $1.1622 earlier in the day.

US Dollar

The US Dollar Index rose 0.1% on Thursday, resuming gains after a pause yesterday, moving close to a two-week high of 98.44 points, reflecting broad dollar strength against both major and minor currencies.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook reaffirmed her intention to remain in office despite President Donald Trump’s calls for her resignation over alleged mortgage fraud.

Minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting showed divisions over tariffs, inflation, and the labor market outlook.

Traders currently see around an 80% chance of a 25-basis point Fed rate cut in September, with expectations of a total 52 basis points of easing through the rest of the year.

European Interest Rates

• Recent eurozone inflation data showed persistent upward pressure on ECB policymakers.

• According to Reuters, a clear majority in the ECB’s latest meeting favored keeping interest rates unchanged in September, marking a second consecutive meeting without changes.

• Money market pricing shows the probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in September remains below 30%.

• To reassess these odds, investors are awaiting the release of key European sector data for August later today.

Euro Outlook

At Economies.com, we expect that if upcoming European sector data comes in stronger than currently anticipated, the likelihood of a September ECB rate cut will diminish, thereby supporting a rise in the euro’s exchange rate in global currency markets.

The Japanese yen declined in Asian trading on Thursday against a basket of major and minor currencies, moving into negative territory versus the US dollar after two days of gains. This comes ahead of the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, where most central bank governors are expected to speak.

Amid rising doubts about the likelihood of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates by 25 basis points in September, investors are awaiting further evidence on the path of monetary policy normalization for the remainder of the year.

Price Overview

• USD/JPY rose 0.15% to ¥147.51, from an opening price of ¥147.31, with a low at ¥147.25.

• The yen ended Wednesday up 0.25% against the dollar, marking a second consecutive daily gain, supported by concerns over Federal Reserve stability due to Trump’s continued pressure on US policymakers.

• BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda is scheduled to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium, and his remarks are expected to provide more clarity on the monetary policy outlook.

Say goodbye to shorts, hello to tailoring.

Riding the office core wave into the new season, H&M Atelier’s first pre-fall collection gives classic menswear a modern makeover. Think slightly oversized cuts versatile enough for days in or out of the office.

The colour story is grown-up but never boring: indigo denim, warm camel, deep brown, and grey, with a punch of turquoise blue that adds just the right pop to remind yourself that this isn’t your dad’s 9 to 5 wardrobe.

Designer Ana Hernández says it best: this is about exploring that transitional moment “after summer when work uniforms come back into play.” Translation? Clothes that make you look pulled together without crushing your spirit during those cloudy commutes.

The grey wool suit has “investment piece” written all over it, but the beauty is in how it can be broken up. Slouched trousers with a ribbed V-neck knit, or the blazer slung over corduroy.

Shirts arrive in crisp white cotton and woven ties elevate the everyday when paired with denim. If you’re after texture, the line is practically a tactile playground: corduroy pants, lived-in leather, and chunky knits that straddle heritage and hype. Even the monogrammed pocket embroidery feels like a wink at luxury.

For those who know H&M Atelier, it’s not about disposable fast fashion. This capsule is aimed at the guy who wants to invest in timeless pieces without selling his soul (or overdraft).

Launched just last year, the line has been building its reputation on clean silhouettes, clever details, and fabric choices that actually feel good. Pre-fall 2025 cements that vision: smart, wearable, and just the right amount of subversive.

This month marks the nativity of the grandmaster of the weird tale, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, and in a bit of eldritch synchronicity, the year of the old gent’s 135th birthday coincides with the 40th anniversary of one of the greatest adaptations of his work to date. In celebration of both the mighty E’ch Pi El and Stuart Gordon‘s 1985 cult classic, Providence, Rhode Island’s annual H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival kicks off its three days of cadaverous cinematic cavorting with a one-night-only screening of RE-ANIMATOR at the RISD Auditorium on Friday, August 22. As a bonus, the beloved film’s screenwriter, frequent Gordon collaborator Dennis Paoli (From Beyond, Castle Freak, Suitable Flesh), will be on hand for a special Q&A following the screening. Paoli will also participate in a series of panels to be held at the Arcade Providence on Saturday and Sunday morning, hosted by the Lovecraft Arts & Sciences Council.

Along with RE-ANIMATOR, this year’s festival features more morbid shorts and fearsome features than you can shake a tentacle at, including Tribe, a new cosmic horror feature from Dan Asma (producer of Fall); Beyond the Drumlins, the second cosmic horror feature written and directed by Dan Bowhers (Blue Hour: the Disappearance of Nick Brandreth); and The Dæmon, a chilling cosmic horror thriller co-directed by Matt Devino and David Michael Yohe.

This week’s BIG move: Rogerwilco launches Township Marketing Podcast

The Township Market Podcast explores the innovative spirit, entrepreneurial energy and untold stories driving South Africa’s dynamic townships.

Hosted by Mongezi Mtati, the podcast delves into what makes these thriving communities tick. Each episode does a deep dive on a particular topic, from street culture and spaza shops to fashion brands and the rise of the premium kasi shopper, with insights from market experts, entrepreneurs, influencers and more.

It’s an essential listen for brand marketers and business owners wishing to break into this R900-billion economy, as well as anyone who wants to better understand the cultural and business landscape of these communities where most of South Africa’s citizens live.

The first episode, in conversation with Brian Makwaiba, managing director, Vuleka Platform and Garth Fraser, route-to-market manager of Tiger Brands, takes a look at the importance of brands getting feedback from spazas and other small stores on customer preferences and digital verification methods to ensure the authenticity of products. That’s followed by a conversation with Freddy Mahhumane, CEO at KasiD and Blake Raubenheimer, group omnichannel executive at Spar, about collaboration opportunities for brands to expand delivery services in townships.

Get Real with Dialogue

Dialogue has launched Get Real with Dialogue, a new series that’s not another podcast, panel or webinar. It’s an open invitation to join the conversations the industry is often too scared to have, the ones that matter most.

Led by founder and MD Tracy Jones and powered by her Dialogue team, Get Real with Dialogue strips away the polish and dives into the messy, meaningful realities of building brands, businesses and people.

“In a world where professional conversations often feel overly polished or performative, we felt something was missing: a space for honest, grounded dialogue about what really shapes our industry – the messy, meaningful and sometimes uncomfortable realities of building brands, businesses and people,” said Jones.

“That’s why we launched Get Real with Dialogue, a short-form, insight-rich content series designed to unpack the issues that matter in communications, leadership and agency culture today. It’s not a platform for puff pieces or panel platitudes. It’s a conversation space built around candour, curiosity and capability, with the people who are actively reshaping the future of work from the inside out.”

New Hilux campaign pays homage to brand’s community

When it comes to pairing lifestyle and utility, no “bakkie” in South Africa has done it for longer than the Toyota Hilux. After 55 years of accolades and off-road adventures, the legacy of Hilux continues with the launch of the new Hilux Legend 55.

The new advertising campaign for the Hilux Legend 55 by Toyota and Studio One (a division of Publicis Groupe) not only shows off the new car, but also pays homage to the community that Hilux has built over decades in our country. And this new Legend 55 campaign is clearly about celebrating the legacy of the Hilux.

Rethabile Bopape, senior manager for marketing and advertising for Toyota South Africa Motors, said, “The Hilux is more than a vehicle, it’s an integral part of South African life. The importance of the Legend 55 goes beyond its distinctive styling, it stands as a tribute to 55 years of Hilux heritage in our country – a celebration of quality, durability and resilience.”

“The campaign launches with a TV commercial set in a quintessential, charming South African town, where some locals exchange knowing glances of quiet acknowledgement. The two things that all these people have in common is that they own a Hilux and that they all have one very faded right sleeve on their shirts. As the ad unfolds, it’s revealed that these two things are intrinsically linked, but let’s not spoil the punchline of the ad for you. Rather watch the full-length version of the ad here.”

Brand strategist Ulli Appelbaum releases The Science of Brand Associations: Win Minds, Win Markets

Why do some brands stick in our minds and wallets while others fade into irrelevance? According to internationally recognised brand strategist Ulli Appelbaum, the answer lies in a secret hiding in plain sight and one of marketing’s most overlooked yet most essential concepts: brand associations.

In his groundbreaking new book, The Science of Brand Associations: Win Minds, Win Markets, Appelbaum draws on cutting-edge neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and decades of evidence-based marketing research to reveal the hidden operating system that drives brand growth — and why mastering it is no longer optional in today’s crowded marketplace.

While most branding advice remains opinion-based or driven by fads, Appelbaum’s approach is refreshingly rigorous—and practical. The book distills decades of research into a hands-on playbook for marketers, brand strategists, and agency leaders who want to audit, build, and strengthen their brand association networks.

“While researching this book, I deliberately avoided opinion-based frameworks or philosophies in favor of those supported by rigorous data and research. The former typically just confuse and don’t provide any clarity or direction,” says Appelbaum.

Air India's Fleet Modernization and Sustainability Goals The timing of this partnership aligns perfectly with Air India's ambitious expansion and modernization plans.
This massive fleet expansion, combined with sustainable fuel adoption, positions Air India as a leader in sustainable aviation.
The success of this initiative could encourage other airlines to pursue similar partnerships, creating a multiplier effect that accelerates the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across India's aviation sector.
This holistic approach to sustainability could serve as a model for other countries looking to develop their own sustainable aviation fuel capabilities.","Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Air India on Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking a step toward reducing carbon emissions in India's aviation sector. This groundbreaking partnership represents a pivotal moment in India's transition toward sustainable aviation, positioning the country as a regional leader in green fuel adoption.

Strategic Partnership for Green Aviation

The partnership comes at a crucial time when the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Through this MoU, IOCL and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets and even exceeding them for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply. This alignment with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) demonstrates India's commitment to meeting global environmental standards.

Panipat Refinery: India's SAF Production Hub

The foundation of this partnership lies in Indian Oil's state-of-the-art facility at Panipat, which has achieved a historic milestone in sustainable fuel production. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (Indian Oil) has become the first in the country to receive the prestigious ISCC CORSIA Certification for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production at its Panipat Refinery. This certification represents more than just regulatory compliance—it positions India as a serious player in the global sustainable aviation fuel market.

IOC plans to begin production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil starting December this year at its Panipat refinery, according to Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney. The facility is expected to produce 35,000 tonne of green fuel annually, using waste cooking oil sourced from various sources. This innovative approach transforms waste into valuable aviation fuel, creating a circular economy model that benefits both environmental sustainability and resource optimization.

Revolutionary Production from Waste Cooking Oil

One of the most remarkable aspects of this initiative is the raw material source. Cooking oil is often discarded after being used for frying at home or in restaurants. However, a refinery of IndianOil has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This transformation of waste cooking oil into high-grade aviation fuel represents a breakthrough in sustainable fuel technology and waste management.

The production process not only addresses environmental concerns but also creates new economic opportunities throughout the supply chain. By utilizing used cooking oil that would otherwise be discarded, Indian Oil has developed a sustainable feedstock source that reduces waste while producing clean aviation fuel. ""The refinery will begin producing 35,000 tons per annum of SAF from the end of this calendar year,"" and the production capacity will be enough to meet India's requirement of blending 1% SAF with conventional jet fuel by 2027.

Meeting International Standards and Certifications

The technical achievement behind this partnership cannot be understated. The refinery's SAF unit has also secured ISCC CORSIA certification, an international standard necessary for commercial aviation fuel production. IOC is currently the only company in India holding this certification for UCO-based SAF, valid for one year. This certification ensures that the sustainable aviation fuel meets the highest international standards for environmental impact and quality.

The ISCC CORSIA certification validates that SAF meets the highest international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards. This global recognition provides confidence to international airlines and aviation stakeholders that Indian-produced SAF meets world-class standards, potentially opening doors for export opportunities and international partnerships.

Air India's Fleet Modernization and Sustainability Goals

The timing of this partnership aligns perfectly with Air India's ambitious expansion and modernization plans. Air India's fleet renewal plan, with 570 new aircraft on order, will enable the airline to operate one of the lowest carbon emitting fleets in the world and its plans to establish more non-stop city-pairs will result in flights with less emissions and itineraries. This massive fleet expansion, combined with sustainable fuel adoption, positions Air India as a leader in sustainable aviation.

The integration of SAF into Air India's operations will significantly reduce the airline's carbon footprint while maintaining operational efficiency. The partnership ensures that as Air India expands its network and increases flight frequencies, it can do so while actively contributing to emissions reduction rather than adding to the problem.

Industry Leadership and Future Implications

The statements from Indian Oil's leadership reflect the strategic importance of this partnership. ""This MoU with Air India represents a strategic step in India's transition to sustainable aviation. With our ISCC-CORSIA-certified SAF from Panipat, IndianOil is ready to provide a sustainable fuel solution that will help decarbonise air travel. Partnering with India's flagship carrier, we are aligning national growth with global climate goals and setting a benchmark for the industry.""

This partnership sets a precedent for the Indian aviation industry and demonstrates how public sector enterprises can collaborate to achieve national sustainability goals. The success of this initiative could encourage other airlines to pursue similar partnerships, creating a multiplier effect that accelerates the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across India's aviation sector.

Economic and Environmental Impact

The economic implications of this partnership extend beyond the immediate parties involved. By establishing a domestic supply chain for sustainable aviation fuel, India reduces its dependence on imported fossil fuels while creating new employment opportunities in the green energy sector. The utilization of waste cooking oil also creates value from what was previously considered waste, contributing to a more circular economy.

From an environmental perspective, the partnership addresses multiple sustainability challenges simultaneously. It reduces aviation emissions, decreases waste disposal problems, and demonstrates the viability of converting waste products into valuable energy sources. This holistic approach to sustainability could serve as a model for other countries looking to develop their own sustainable aviation fuel capabilities.

The Air India-Indian Oil partnership represents more than just a commercial agreement—it symbolizes India's commitment to sustainable development and its determination to lead by example in the global fight against climate change while maintaining robust economic growth in the aviation sector.",https://www.100knots.com/airlines_dashboard/uploads/blog/1755743893.webp,N,,2025-08-21 14:15:26.940350

Creatively led by BBH India, ‘Team Drive’ is Publicis Groupe India’s bespoke ‘Power of One’ unit created especially for Škoda Auto India.
It spotlights Škoda owners, who are fans of the brand, and encourages countless admirers, currently non-owners, to take the leap to buy one.
Ashish Gupta, Brand Director Škoda Auto India, shared, “At Škoda Auto India, we’ve always believed that our customers are more than just owners.
Our partnership has always been about building brand love, earning trust, and taking Škoda to more people across the country.","Škoda Auto India, in collaboration with ‘Team Drive’ at Publicis Groupe India has launched a new integrated campaign, ‘Fans Not Owners’, marking the brand’s 25-year journey in India.

Creatively led by BBH India, ‘Team Drive’ is Publicis Groupe India’s bespoke ‘Power of One’ unit created especially for Škoda Auto India.

Rooted in the belief that admiration can lead to action, the campaign bridges the gap between desire and decision, while highlighting the ease and value of owning a Škoda. It spotlights Škoda owners, who are fans of the brand, and encourages countless admirers, currently non-owners, to take the leap to buy one.

Ashish Gupta, Brand Director Škoda Auto India, shared, “At Škoda Auto India, we’ve always believed that our customers are more than just owners. They’re passionate fans who truly live the brand. As we celebrate 25 incredible years in India, it’s this deep emotional connection that powers us forward. Our new campaign, ‘Fans, Not Owners’, is not just a celebration of our journey, but a reflection of the passion our fans bring to the brand, alongside the relentless commitment of our team and the strength of our dealer partners.”

The campaign weaves car features into playful storytelling, moving beyond the conventional showcase of specs. It celebrates decades of fan love, told through the eyes of children who see magic in the machines that move their world.

At the heart of this integrated campaign is ‘Doda’, a heartwarming film that celebrates the pure, irrational love a young fan has for her Škoda. Additionally, another brand film that playfully captures the unshakeable pride and imagination of young Škoda fans will be released soon. Both the films are told through the boundless imagination of children.

As a prelude to the films, a ‘Doda Takeover’ social media campaign saw Maya, the child protagonist from the Doda film, take over Škoda India’s Instagram handle to engage audiences and build intrigue.

The campaign even inspired dealerships to join in. At few dealerships in Mumbai, the Škoda logo was swapped for ‘Doda.’

This 360-degree campaign celebrates Škoda’s legacy in India by capturing the love passed down through generations. It provides a sneak peek into Škoda’s renowned European engineering, safety, and build quality, and reassures consumers that Škoda cars are not just aspirational, but also practical, reliable, and perfect for modern lifestyles. Thus, encouraging fans to take the leap to ownership.

Paritosh Srivastava, CEO, Saatchi & Saatchi India, BBH India and Saatchi Propagate said, “Škoda’s 25 years in India is a huge milestone, and being part of this journey for a decade makes the celebration even more special for us. Our partnership has always been about building brand love, earning trust, and taking Škoda to more people across the country. The ‘Fans Not Owners’ campaign is a step forward in that direction, and we are excited to continue building on this legacy while supporting Škoda in realising its future ambitions.”",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/ec2b70064bab8f0a37d194a660b6ac43.jpeg,N,,2025-08-21 07:08:28.647717

Some brands are openly passing along tariffs in the form of higher prices.","The ""value wars"" are back as tariffs threaten to push broader prices higher and cash-strapped households pull back.

Driving the news: Target is leaning harder into low-price private store brands and keeping the $1/$3/$5 front-of-store value bin prices as it retools merchandising, executives said Wednesday. The Minneapolis-based retailer also announced a CEO succession plan.

McDonald's is rolling out nationwide combo meal discounts in September, subsidizing franchisees to cut prices by 15% on eight meals and reviving an expanded value menu, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Kohl's is reversing years of coupon exclusions, expanding the brands eligible for discounts to woo frustrated shoppers and drive store traffic.

And Pizza Hut is launching $5 ""Crafted Flatzz"" before 5pm, while Olive Garden is reviving its Never Ending Pasta Bowl at the same price since 2022.

The big picture: Lower-income households are disproportionately trading down or pausing spend, forcing companies that drifted upmarket during the inflation surge to reset price points and reposition value.

Between the lines: Deep deals can ding profit margins, but chains are betting sharper entry prices will rebuild traffic and checkouts.

McDonald's subsidies highlight how far brands will go to reset ""affordability"" perceptions.

Target's ""last resort"" pricing stance shows retailers will squeeze suppliers, change assortments and lean on private-label mix before passing along tariff pain.

What they're saying: ""Consumers remained very hard-pressed in terms of finances, so they are seeking value and sharp pricing to make their dollars stretch further,"" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders tells Axios.

Saunders said companies are responding with price cuts, sales and more deals, which can move the deal and drive volume.

""Offering more value options on the menu is a way of course correcting,"" Saunders said, noting McDonald's went from a cheap fast food fix to a relatively expensive purchase for a family.

Rick Gomez, Target's chief commercial officer and executive vice president, said during an earnings call Wednesday that consumers are looking to stretch their budgets, ""navigate inflation and uncertainty around tariffs.""

Yes, but: Deals won't be found everywhere. Some brands are openly passing along tariffs in the form of higher prices.

Estée Lauder CFO Akhil Shrivastava said Wednesday the beauty brand is weighing increases.

Sony announced Wednesday that it will raise prices of its PlayStation 5 console in the U.S. by about $50 starting Thursday as it faces higher costs.

Last month, CEO Brian Niccol said the mandate will rise again to four days a week this October for corporate workers under the Back to Starbucks transformation plan.
Union pressure builds At store level, Starbucks introduced new uniform rules this past May, requiring baristas to wear black tops and khaki, black, or denim bottoms under a “green apron-first” policy.

The change, first reported by Bloomberg, applies for the fiscal year ending in September.

The uniform raise is tied to broader cost management as the company pushes through operational changes ranging from new technology tools to store renovations.

“[Customers] can see and feel the differences these investments are making,” a Starbucks spokesperson said. “As we make these significant investments, we need to carefully manage all our other costs.”

Cost control and pay adjustments

The shift is the latest in a series of workforce-related moves. In February, Starbucks announced plans to cut 1,100 corporate jobs and increase back-to-office requirements to three days a week for executives at the vice president level and above.

Last month, CEO Brian Niccol said the mandate will rise again to four days a week this October for corporate workers under the Back to Starbucks transformation plan. He also outlined an exit payout for those unable or unwilling to comply.

Senior leaders at the vice president level and above, along with support center leaders, will need to relocate to the Seattle or Toronto area. Future hires and internal transfers must also be based in one of the two hubs.

Union pressure builds

At store level, Starbucks introduced new uniform rules this past May, requiring baristas to wear black tops and khaki, black, or denim bottoms under a “green apron-first” policy. Workers United responded by filing a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging the company enforced the dress code without collective bargaining.

Starbucks is also in negotiations with unionized baristas. In April, the union rejected the company’s proposal of at least a 2% raise for baristas.",https://www.executivegrapevine.com/uploads/articles/social-starbucks-new-pay-raise-policy-aug25.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 08:11:09.343065

Market Update

Thanks to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been on a steady path downward, easing back toward that 2% sweet spot. Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn’t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September 2024, a quarter in November) have propped up markets, especially after Trump’s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there’s still plenty to ponder — tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy.

Lighting the Blues touchpaper

With 2005 an ignition point for unprecedented glory and the current Chelsea now world-beaters and looking ahead, full of ambition, the shirt synergy is clear – as the torch is passed on.

The black and silver colours so famously ripped off and thrown to the crowd in bare-chested celebration by the likes of John Terry and Frank Lampard, after winning the ‘Battle of Blackburn’, are revisited 20 years later with black again predominant and silver featuring on the collar, sleeves and sock tops. Plus, there is a royal blue trim adding a further Chelsea touch.

This is Nike Total 90. Every club has its mythology, and every legend has their moment. The T90 third kits reignite the raw, rebellious spirit of football’s most untamed era, where audacity, unpredictability, and chaos shaped the game, way beyond the full-time whistle.

For Chelsea, the revival of an icon looks best with a blue trim inviting this new generation of legends to step into their game changing era. This kit celebrates the audacious club era that changed the game forever.

Written in football history. Worn by the next legends of club and culture. Immortalised in T90.

Jennifer Talbot, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine John Reed, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine Research and Development and Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, will be joining us for Q and A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately sixty minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.

Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson: Thank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. I’m excited to talk about our very strong second quarter. Today’s results showcase the strength of our uniquely diversified business as the only major healthcare company operating in both the medtech and innovative medicine sectors. In the second quarter, we delivered operational sales growth of 4.6% across our business. In Innovative Medicine, we reported 3.8% operational sales growth, delivering more than $15,000,000,000 in quarterly sales for the first time.

No other healthcare company has grown through the loss of exclusivity of a multibillion dollar product in the first year. In our case, Stellara and Jet, that is exactly what we are doing and for the second quarter in a row. Our performance was driven by double digit growth across 13 brands, including DARZALEX, CARVICTI, TEKVAI and TALVE as well as Ribrebam plus Las Cruze, Tremfya, CAPLYTA and SPRAVATO. And in Medtech, we delivered 6.1% operational sales growth with particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular, surgery and vision. Based on our strong performance in the quarter, we are pleased to raise our full year sales guidance by $2,000,000,000 and EPS guidance by $0.25 from $10.6 to $10.85 Results like these are a direct result of our deep and resilient portfolio.

It’s what makes Johnson and Johnson unique. Today, we will focus on the remarkable ways we are driving innovation and creating value for patients and shareholders. We will highlight the depth of our portfolio and pipeline, focusing on six areas of unmet need and where we are delivering significant growth, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular, surgery, and vision. These are spaces where we are moving the conversation from treatment to cure and where we are extending and improving lives in meaningful ways. Let’s start with innovative medicine and oncology where we have a bold vision to eliminate cancer.

Our leading products for the treatment of blood cancers and solid tumors are built on cutting edge scientific platforms that are transforming outcomes for patients. With more than 10 products in market across 26 approved indications and over 25 treatments in late stage development, we expect to become the number one oncology company by 2030 with sales

Jennifer Talbot, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson: of more than $50,000,000,000

Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson: And when you look at our quarterly results in oncology with operational sales growth of 22.3%, you can see that we are well on our way to achieving that. I’ll draw your attention to three key areas of Q2 progress. First is multiple myeloma where we have treatments in every line of therapy. Approximately eighty percent of myeloma patients today receive a Johnson and Johnson medicine at some point in their treatment journey. And in Q2, we presented several important sets of data.

They include new five year data showing a single treatment of our CAR T therapy Carvicti has the potential to deliver long term remission. We also presented the first data from our investigational trial specific antibody, which showed an unprecedented one hundred percent overall response rate in heavily pretreated patients. With results like this, we are closer than ever to our ambition of curing multiple myeloma. Second is lung cancer where our chemotherapy free combination of Ribrebam plus Las Cruze has a projected overall survival of at least a year over the current standard of care in frontline non small cell lung cancer with EGFR gene mutations. Intent to prescribe continues to grow among healthcare professionals, which you can see in our strong quarterly sales.

This is a life changing advancement for patients and one we are building on with a pipeline of novel therapies. And third is bladder cancer, where we are excited to share that we have received FDA priority review for TAR200, a first of its kind drug releasing system. We anticipate launching TAR-two 100 for high risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer later this year, a transformational product that harnesses our unique expertise in both innovative medicine and medtech. We expect TAR200 to generate at least $5,000,000,000 in annual peak year sales. In immunology, we have a twenty five year legacy of redefining the standard of care and we are just getting started.

With six products in market across 14 approved indications and many treatments in late stage development, we are expanding treatment options for patients and restoring health for millions of people around the world. From Remicade and Symphony to Stellar and Tremfya and now exploring targeted oral peptides and future combinations, the growth potential of our immunology portfolio and pipeline continues to be significant. For immunology, I will draw your attention to two key areas of Q2 progress. First is Tremfya, which has recently expanded into inflammatory bowel disease. Tremfya grew 30% in the quarter.

With strong uptake in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, we expect it to generate at least $10,000,000,000 annually in peak year sales. We also made important progress in our pipeline in Q2 and expect to file ICOTROKINRA with the FDA in the third quarter as the first targeted oral peptide to selectively block the IL-twenty three receptor with similar efficacy to a biologic. As a once a day pill, this molecule has the potential to set a new standard in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. In neuroscience, we are building on a seventy year legacy and expect to be the number one company by the end of the decade. We are pushing boundaries in diseases like schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer’s, which together affect one in eight people worldwide.

In Q2, Spravato grew 53% delivering sustained double digit growth and demonstrating the power of this medicine for patients living with difficult to treat depression. We also completed the acquisition of intracellular therapies this quarter. Intracellular CAPLYTA is approved to treat adults with schizophrenia and bipolar depression and we are excited about the anticipated major depressive disorder approval later this year. With the addition of CAPLYTA, we now have five neuroscience products in market across six approved indications and eight treatments in late stage development. CAPLYTA adds to Johnson and Johnson’s robust lineup of therapies with $5,000,000,000 plus potential in big year sales and further solidifies sales growth above analyst expectations through the rest of the decade.

Turning to medtech and in cardiovascular specifically, we are leaders in heart recovery, circulatory restoration, and electrophysiology. Cardiovascular has some of the largest unmet needs in healthcare and is one of the fastest growing spaces in medtech. In Q2, we delivered over 22% operational sales growth over the quarter, driven by new product performance in Abiomed, Shockwave and strength in mapping in electrophysiology. Today,

: we’re

Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson: a leader in four of the largest and highest growth medtech segments within cardiovascular intervention impacting more than 1,000,000 patients each year. Now, let me highlight three areas of important progress from Q2.

Jennifer Talbot, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson: First

Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson: is electrophysiology, which delivered close to 10% operational sales growth over the quarter, driven by new product performance and strength in mapping. We have now completed more than ten thousand body pulse cases globally with a reported neurovascular event rate of less than zero point five percent consistent with published rates across other PFA platforms. Second, we continue to advance a suite of cardiovascular solutions to expand our market leadership, including our dual energy Thermocool SmartTouch SF catheter, where we performed our first cases in Europe this quarter. It also includes Omnipulse, where we presented strong early data that will expand our portfolio of tools for safe and streamlined ablation procedures. Third is Shawwave’s unique intravascular ethotripsy technology or IVL, which has transformed the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is driving significant growth.

Shockwave is expected to be our thirteenth billion dollars medtech platform by the end of the year, a position that is further strengthened by a compelling body of evidence on the benefits of this technology. This includes data showing an IVL first approach can achieve excellent outcomes in female patients with complex calcified coronary artery disease. In surgery, we have spent one hundred and forty years advancing the standard of care and today our surgical technologies are used in most Operating rooms around the world. Q2 highlights include the introduction of the Ethicon 4,000 Surgical Stapler, the newest advancement in our surgical portfolio. Featuring advanced stapling technology and reloads, the Ethicon 4,000 minimizes surgical leaks and bleeding, which are common and costly surgical complications for patients and hospitals.

This advanced stapling technology will be harnessed for future use exclusively on the Ottava robotic surgery system. And as mentioned on our earnings call in April, Ottava completed its first clinical cases, gastric bypass surgeries performed in Houston. In our conversations with surgeons who have spent time on Ottava, they tell us that they are eager for the system’s sophisticated architecture, design features like Twinmotion, the surgeon entrusted Ethicon advanced instrumentation only available in Ottava, and the future connection to our open digital ecosystem, Polyphonic. We plan to submit for an FDA de novo approval next year. And finally vision, where we have a deep legacy in developing transformational innovation.

With quarterly growth of 4.6% across the business and 8.9% in surgical vision, the portfolio has a robust growth trajectory driven by our AccuView Oasis MAX 1D family of contact lenses and our Technis ODC and Technis PureC intraocular lenses. And with the Q2 release of the first disposable multifocal lenses for people with astigmatism, we have high expectations. You know, few other healthcare companies can talk about their impact across as many high growth areas as Johnson and Johnson, and none spanning both innovative medicine and med tech. These six examples are only a cross section of our cutting edge portfolio. This depth and breadth is who we are at Johnson and Johnson.

It’s how we grow through a major loss of exclusivity, how we have reinvented ourselves time and time again, and how we will deliver strong financial performance through the end of the decade and beyond. The bottom line is this, Johnson and Johnson’s relentless focus on innovation yields results quarter after

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: quarter, year after year. I will now turn the call back over to Darren. Thank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.

Starting with Q2 twenty twenty five sales results. Worldwide sales were $23,700,000,000 for the quarter. Sales increased 4.6% despite an approximate seven ten basis point headwind from Stellara. Growth in The U. S.

Was 7.80.6% outside of The U. S. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 160 basis points, primarily due to the Intracellular and Shockwave acquisitions. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5,500,000,000 with diluted earnings per share of $2.29 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 a year ago.

Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6,700,000,000 with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.77 representing a decrease of 2.11.8%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of twenty twenty four. The decrease is driven by interest associated with incremental debt from the Intracellular acquisition and GP erosion from Stellara. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter with a focus on the six areas Joaquin discussed that will drive significant growth for the enterprise. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, where our results demonstrate the depth of our expertise in oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Worldwide sales of $15,200,000,000 increased 3.8% despite an approximate eleven seventy basis point headwind from Stellara, demonstrating the strength of our key brands and new launches.

Growth in The US was 7.6% and minus 1.6% outside The US. Growth outside of The US was negatively impacted by Stellara Biosimilars and the COVID-nineteen vaccine. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 140 basis points on worldwide growth due to the Intracellular acquisition. In oncology, starting with myeloma, DARZALEX growth was 21.5%, primarily driven by continued strong share gains of approximately 4.1 points across all lines of therapy, with close to eight points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. CarVictee achieved sales of $439,000,000 with growth of over 100%, driven by share gains and capacity expansion.

This reflects continued strong sequential growth 17.9% as we expand outside of The U. S. Tekveli and Talvay growth was 22.454.3% respectively, bolstered by continued expansion into the community setting. Patient demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. In prostate cancer, Alida delivered strong growth of 21% with continued share gains and market growth.

In lung cancer, Ribrovant plus Lascluse delivered sales of $179,000,000 and growth over 100%, with sequential growth of 26.5% driven by continued strong launch uptake. We continue to see share gains in both first and second lines of therapy. Within immunology, Tremfya delivered growth of 30.1%, primarily driven by share gains with continued strong uptake across recently launched IBD indications and overall market growth. STELARA declined by 43.2%, driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign, which is in line with our expectations. In neuroscience, Provato growth of 53% was driven by continued strong demand from physicians and patients.

Long acting injectables declined by 6.3% due to the impact of Part D redesign and unfavorable patient mix. I’ll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8,500,000,000 increased 6.1% with growth of 8% in The U. S. And 4.1 outside The U.

S, driven by strong performance in three focus areas: cardiovascular, surgery and vision. Acquisitions and divestitures had positive impact of 200 basis points on worldwide growth, primarily due to Shockwave. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 9.8% versus prior year, driven by strength in competitive mapping, new product performance and procedure growth. Abiomed delivered growth of 16.9% with continued strong adoption of Impella technology and Shockwave delivered strong double digit growth with the recent introduction of the Javelin and E8 catheters. As a reminder, the acquisition benefit of Shockwave was lapped to the May.

Surgery grew 1.8% despite divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 60 basis points. Performance was primarily driven by technology penetration in wound closure and the strength of the portfolio in biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and the negative impact of China VBP across the portfolio. In vision, contact lenses and other ocular products grew 2.9% driven by strategic price actions and strong performance in the AccuView Oasis one day family of contact lenses, including the recent launch of Oasis Max One Day multifocal for astigmatism. Surgical vision growth of 8.9% continues to be driven by strong performance in Tectus Odyssey, Pure C, and iHance.

The Orthopedics business declined by 1.6% driven by competitive pressures, the transformation program and China VBP. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of twenty twenty five. I’d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter a year ago. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points, driven by product mix and amortization related to the Intracellular acquisition in Innovative Medicine as well as medtech macroeconomic factors and VBP in China. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses improved 50 basis points driven by corporate expense rationalization, partially offset by increased investment in recent acquisitions.

Research and development expenses leveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio rationalization and expense phasing in medtech. We continued our strong investment in research and development with $3,500,000,000 or approximately 15% of sales in Q2. Interest income and expense was a net expense of $48,000,000 as compared to $125,000,000 of income in the second quarter of twenty twenty four, primarily driven by lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance associated with the Intracellular acquisition. Other income and expense was a net expense of $100,000,000 compared to an expense of $700,000,000 in the prior year, primarily driven by lower talc litigation expense in 2025 and the $400,000,000 loss on the sale of the retained stake in Cambuch as recorded in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.7% compared to 18.5% in the same period last year.

I encourage you to review our upcoming 10 Q for details on the changes in taxes. Lastly, I’ll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company’s income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let’s look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. In support of our efforts to increase financial transparency, you will again find GAAP to non GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release. Innovative medicine margin declined from 44.6% to 42.7%, primarily driven by negative mix and cost of products sold related to Solara.

Medtech margin declined from 25.7% to 22.2% driven by macroeconomic factors in cost of products sold as well as other income. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to John.

Joe Walk, CFO, Johnson & Johnson: Thank you, Darren, and glad to see your first earnings call is off to a good start. I look forward to you leveraging your recent experience leading the Innovative Medicine Finance team to benefit Johnson and Johnson’s Investor Relations function. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As already highlighted, we delivered a very strong second quarter, exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line.

While our currently marketed products and platforms drove this quarter’s performance, the progress across our pipeline in the first half of the year heightens our conviction to achieve, and I’d be willing to bet likely beat the upper end of the growth targets we conveyed at our 2023 enterprise business review. As previously mentioned by Joaquin and Darren, the Innovative Medicine business continues to grow through Stellaris loss of exclusivity driven by our in market portfolio. We continue to advance our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones that will help drive sustained and accelerating growth through the back half of the decade. In medtech, while we still have work to do, we saw improvement over first quarter results, driven by strong performance in the cardiovascular portfolio, surgical vision and wound closure in surgery. We remain focused on higher growth markets, enhancing competitiveness to gain market share and executing against our transformation initiatives to improve margins.

Let’s get into some of the financial commentary starting with our cash position. Free cash flow through the first half of twenty twenty five exceeded 6,000,000,000, which accounts for elevated tax payments related to the final annual TCJA toll tax payment when compared to the first half of twenty twenty four. We ended the second quarter with $19,000,000,000 of cash and marketable securities and $51,000,000,000 of debt for a net debt position of $32,000,000,000 These figures include the debt raised for the $14,500,000,000 Intercellular acquisition, which closed on April 2. Regarding talc litigation, we expect the Daubert hearing to commence this fall and look forward to the court reexamining the junk science the mass tort plaintiffs bar has funded to promote baseless talc claims against Johnson and Johnson. Turning to our full year guidance for 2025.

Driven by the strength of our first half performance, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by approximately 900,000,000 We are now expecting operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%, with a midpoint of $92,900,000,000 or 4.8%, representing a full point better when compared to prior guidance. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, our adjusted operational sales growth is now expected to be in the range of 3.2% to 3.7% compared to 2024. As you know, we don’t speculate on future currency movements, And last quarter, we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.11. The US dollar has weakened across all major currencies since April. Last week, the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar was 1.17.

We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1,100,000,000 versus previous guidance. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6% with a midpoint of $93,400,000,000 or 5.4%. Currently, our guidance does not include the impact of the most favored nation concepts. With respect to MFN, we share the administration’s goal that American patients should pay less by addressing the real drivers of higher US costs, including middlemen driving up prices and foreign markets not paying their fair share. Turning to other notable items on the P and L.

At the beginning of the year, we guided to an approximate 300 basis points improvement in operating margin. Despite what you may have calculated on a year to date basis, we remain confident and reiterate our operating margin guide for the full year. This is due to efficiency programs designed for margin improvement as well as non recurring one time IP R and D charges that occurred in the second half of twenty twenty four. This expected improvement also takes into consideration the dilution from the Intercellular transaction as well as what we know today about the impact of tariffs on our business. During our first quarter conference call, we anticipated an impact from tariffs in 2025 to be approximately $400,000,000 Based on the current tariff landscape, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $200,000,000 exclusively related to our medtech business.

We will look to reinvest the differential to continue to accelerate our pipeline and further power the launch of our new products, those on the market with new indications and those with near term anticipated approvals. We continue to monitor what the future year’s impact could be from tariffs on our business. For net interest expense, we now project between 0 and $100,000,000 an improvement from the previous guidance, primarily driven by higher interest earned on cash balances. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 17 to 17.5% for the full year, with the increase largely due to an adjustment to the company’s global tax reserves. We are pleased that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides certainty for our previously announced $55,000,000,000 commitment to invest here in The United States.

This includes provisions such as permanent expensing for domestic r and d spend, permanent bonus depreciation, and a 100% expensing of qualified production property, including our newly planned facility in North Carolina. We also welcome the improvements that were made to the international tax system. For your modeling, it is worth noting that the tax rate on foreign earnings known as GILTI is increasing by approximately 2% from a statutory rate of 10.5% to 12.6%. This will result in an approximate 1% increase to our global effective tax rate in 2026. Turning to earnings per share.

We are pleased to increase our reported adjusted earnings per share estimate by $0.25 to $10.85 or 8.7% at the midpoint for a range of $10.8 to $10.9 which is a combination of operational improvement and the favorable foreign currency dynamics I referenced earlier. Embedded in that is $08 of adjusted operational earnings per share, increasing our guidance to $10.68 or 7% at the midpoint. I’ll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding Innovative Medicine, we maintain the assumption that Stellaris biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year with erosion similar to HUMIRA’s in year two, which is still our proxy with the additive unfavorable impact of Part D redesign.

Turning to med tech, we anticipate an acceleration in growth to be driven by the increased adoption of newly launched products in cardiovascular, surgery and vision. We continue to expect normalized procedure volumes and typical seasonality patterns throughout the remainder of the year. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin has already referenced, we are excited for the expected pipeline progress in the remainder of 2025. In innovative medicine, this includes expected approvals in TAR200 in non muscle invasive bladder cancer, subcutaneous Ribrovant for non small cell lung cancer in The US, Tremfya subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis, and CAPLYTA for adjunctive major depressive disorder. Anticipated filings for approval include icotrochinra in psoriasis and TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis.

As far as data readouts, we are planning for Ribrovant in head and neck cancer and icotrochinra in ulcerative colitis, as well as head to head data versus SuTiktu in psoriasis. In medtech, we continue to make progress with our clinical trials for our Otava robotic surgical system. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we are planning regulatory submission for dual energy thermal cool smart touch SF catheter for cardiac arrhythmia in The US, an Impella ECP submission in heart recovery, as well as Javelin and Shockwave e eight launches in circulatory restoration outside of The US. In orthopedics, we will be launching a tune revision hinge and a new plating system called Volt in The US. We will also be launching the Ethicon 4,000 stapler with three d reloads in surgery and the AccuView Oasis MAX in vision for astigmatism.

In summary, I trust you agree the results delivered in the first half are evidence that our portfolio has the breadth and depth that enables us to attain growth, even in the face of a major LOE where very few, if any, other company could. The clinical advancements provide a robust base for accelerated top line growth, not just for the remainder of this year, but for the back half of the decade. We’re confident that the strength of our business model enables Johnson and Johnson to navigate a dynamic external environment while delivering on our financial commitments. This is directly attributable to the hard work and dedication of our 138,000 colleagues who focus daily on advancing our pipeline, increasing market share, and progressing breakthrough treatments to patients that create long term value for our shareholders. Thank you.

And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Kevin, will you please provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q and A?

Conference Operator: Certainly. We’ll now be conducting a question and answer session. If you’d like to be placed into question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you’d like to withdraw your question, please press star then the number 2. Please limit your questions to 1 question only.

Our first question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.

Chris Schott, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks so much for the question. J and J also reported a very strong top line beat despite the Stellara LOE. And I’d be interested, Joe, in any color you might hear of in terms of the drivers of upside to the guidance for the year as we think about how much of this is the innovative business versus medtech and any particular franchise in those businesses that’s driving guidance raise? Thank you.

Joe Walk, CFO, Johnson & Johnson: Yeah. Good morning, Chris, and thank you very much for the question. I I would say it’s, both are contributing, in terms of the strong performance. And in fact, I would say this is a great opportunity for Jennifer and Tim to address some of the strength that we saw in our second quarter results. As you saw and credit to Jennifer and her team achieving the first $15,000,000,000 quarter despite $1,200,000,000 of year on year erosion in the quarter from Stellard.

I don’t think any other company can do that. And then, Tim, a notable improvement from what we reported in q one that gives us a lot of enthusiasm for the balance of this year where we we as you heard in my earlier comments, we expect both businesses to actually continue that momentum and grow better in the second half than the for the first half. But why don’t I turn it over to Jennifer and Tim to give you some insights from their perspective?

Jennifer Talbot, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks so much, Joe, and and good morning, everybody. And, Joe, you stole my thunder on the, the over 15,000,000,000 in our first $15,000,000,000 quarter. You know, importantly, if you take a look at the 90% of our business that is not Stellara, we actually had extraordinarily robust growth of 15.5% growth, really demonstrating the strength across our portfolio. We had 13 brands that were growing double digits. And as we take a look at those, they are the vast majority of those are not only our growth drivers for today and tomorrow, but are also key growth drivers out through the end of the decade.

So a few of the notable drivers there. So first in oncology, DARZALEX continues to perform very well, CARVICTI performed well, ERLIDA, and we’re really pleased with the launch uptakes thus far on Ribrovant plus Lascluse in non small cell lung cancer. In immunology, Tremfya is off to a great start in ulcerative colitis and also Crohn’s disease. And across neuroscience, both SPRAVATO and CAPLYTA both had really, really strong performance for the quarter. So as I mentioned, 13 brands with double digit growth.

I won’t go into all of those, but really, really strong across the base of our business. And we’re really excited throughout the rest of this year because we’ve got a number of additional catalysts that are coming through with additional approvals and such. Tim?

Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson: Thank you, Jennifer. And Chris, to your question, I mean, for MedTech, we were happy with our Q2 operational growth of 6.1%. This is a 4.4% sequential improvement over the first quarter. I think you know the primary contributor is certainly cardiovascular, 22% growth. We are by far and away now one of the largest and certainly the fastest growing medtech company in cardiovascular, not only on the back of the success of the AbiaMed and Shockwave acquisitions, but also the tremendous improvements you saw in our electrophysiology business, which by the way has a $5,000,000,000 base.

And so tremendous performances there. We also saw great results in Vision, primarily driven both by contact lenses as well as almost double digit growth in Surgical Vision and then continued solid growth in Surgery, especially on the back performance in wound closure and biosurgery, both of those businesses, multibillion dollar businesses, by the way, growing close to 7%. And as we look to the back half, what gives us confidence in continued acceleration is a couple of things. Firstly, it’s important to remember that Q1 and Q2 had difficult prior year competitors. But more importantly, what gives us confidence is the further acceleration as we continue to shift our portfolio into higher growth markets and really bring truly differentiated innovation to market.

In cardiovascular, that will continue with Abiomed, which continues to add to our portfolio. But more importantly, the evidence base around the benefits of Impella continues to impress both with the danger shock study and the recent ACC and Ah guidelines supporting Impella use in patients with cardiogenic shock. Shockwave, two new products this launch, E8 as well as Javelin, which will further drive our performance specifically in the peripheral space. And then with EP, you’re going to see continued performance of Varipulse, and we’ll add to that with the addition of the dual energy STSF catheter in the European Union. In vision, this is a true turnaround story.

We’re seeing tremendous results, especially with our Tectnes and PURE C IOLs. And just to put that in context, in The U. S, we had our second consecutive year of quarter of double digit growth growing 13%. And then in the back half of the year, you’ll also see the launch of the AccuView Oasis MAX one day multifocal for astigmatism. I know there’s a lot Well, this is the world’s first and only daily disposable lens for people with both astigmatism and presbyopia.

Surgery, we continue to see performance expect continued performance on the back of SurgiFlo, Eesthesia and StrataFix. And then I will call out that while our ortho performance was softer than we would like, we have strong reasons to believe in continued acceleration through the remainder of the year with roughly 18, five ten approvals last year, close to 40 outside of The U. S. And so big launch is coming our way, especially in the areas where we face the most competition, hips and knees. We have the Velis Uni Knee Attune Revision Hinge as well as KINSIGHT two point zero.

And then also in Spine, we’re seeing the rollout of our Spine Velis robot as well as Trialtus, which we are confident that will continue to bolster our growth and competitiveness. And so I think in summary, due to easier comps as well as significant new products, we’re confident in continued acceleration in the back half.

Joe Walk, CFO, Johnson & Johnson: So Chris, as you can see it, it’s hard to pick one particular product that gives us reason for our enthusiasm in the back half. But if I had to point and maybe pick a couple of favorite children, would say Tremfya, we’re just getting started with our inflammatory bowel disease and we grew thirty percent in the quarter. Those indications will provide further growth. As a reminder, Stellaris, had seventy percent of their prescriptions within IBD. Looking forward to getting the subcutaneous administration approval for lung cancer with Ribrovant and Lascluse.

And then on the med tech side, I think the really shining star, well, maybe not the highest number is the EP energy that we have going forward, either maintaining or recapturing that market leadership position as well as expected improvement in our contact lens business. You saw about 3% growth this quarter, with the launch of one day AccuView OASIS MAX that treats presbyopia and astigmatism. We think there’s, even higher growth ahead on the horizon.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Great. Thanks, Chris, for the question. And, Kevin, next question, please.

Conference Operator: Certainly. Our next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.

Terence Flynn, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. You mentioned oncology target of $50,000,000,000 by end of the decade. Looks like that’s well above consensus. Just wondering if you could point us to the largest deltas that you see there.

I know you’ve talked about TAR-two 100 in the past, but maybe any other areas. And then on Ribrevant subcu, can you just confirm that you’ve responded to the CRL and, what the, target review, date would be for that, approval? Thank you.

Jennifer Talbot, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks, Hai. It’s Jennifer again. We feel really confident in that $50,000,000,000 target for our Oncology business. It’s really based on the strength across the base of our business. You can take a look at multiple myeloma with DARZALEX and a lot of continued growth opportunity.

Carvicti, also a $5,000,000,000 plus brand. We’ve got TekVeili and Talve. We may come to it later, a TriSpecific that we’ve started outlining and presenting data on. So multiple myeloma we anticipate to continue to be a stronghold. We’ve got a really nice franchise in prostate cancer right now with ERLEADA that is growing very well.

You mentioned TAR200, that is probably the asset that has the biggest disconnect between our internal forecasts and what the Street expects. We’re really excited for this product and to be launching it in the second half of the year with the ability to truly transform the treatment for non muscle invasive bladder cancer. There has not been much innovation there in a very, very, very long time. And we think we’re going to bring new hope. The data that we’ve presented there looks fabulous.

We’ve really designed this product by urologists, for urologists to seamlessly fit into routine clinical practice, and we really think that we’ve got a winner there. And if just take a look, I think, boy, we see if you take a look at 2028 consensus, we actually see our numbers at least three times higher. So that’s a big disconnect. And then again, this is oncology. There’s a lot to talk about last on Ribrovant plus Lascluse.

So a quick update, the launch is going very well. As a reminder, Ribrovant plus Lascluse is the first and only regimen that provides really clinically meaningful overall survival to patients greater than probably twelve months versus ocimertinib. If you think about new patients, newly diagnosed patients, they want to live longer and they do not want to be using chemo in a first line setting. And so we think we’ve really got the winning combination and are poised to become the new standard of care in that frontline lung cancer EGFR mutated lung cancer. And so this is another one of our $5,000,000,000 plus assets.

In terms of the launch, while we’re still early in it, as Joaquin had noted, the intent to prescribe has grown consistently and we’re now the number one regimen that providers are claiming that they intend to prescribe for those frontline patients. We’ve done a great job of penetrating. We’re already in nearly 100% of our high priority accounts. And if we take a look really across the lines of therapy, one out of every four patients across those lines of therapy is now being initiated on a Ripravant plus Lascluse combination. So making really nice progress here.

So key to that continued growth is the subcu dosage. And so we have responded to the agency. This was not anything where the agency required any further clinical studies or clinical data. This was a manufacturing related question or two. So we’ve responded and we’re looking forward to the second half and hopefully getting approval on that.

John Reed, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine Research and Development, Johnson & Johnson: Terrence, John Reed here. If I could build just a little bit on Jennifer. We’ve had, really great momentum in the oncology pipeline. In the last eighteen months, last year and a half, I think we’ve had eight what we would call, proof of concept readouts that then gave us the confidence to now move into late stage pivotal studies across the portfolio. Since you asked about Riborband, I would also remind you that we’re in advanced studies now for colorectal cancer, which will be a a huge opportunity for patients and for our portfolio.

We’re now moving into head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with really exciting data there in our early development program. On the bladder cancer side, of course, TAR two hundred is the star of the portfolio now. But right on its heels is TAR two ten with a targeted therapy where we’ve seen complete responses north of ninety percent. So that is an entire platform for us, and we’ll be putting other payloads in those devices in the future. And then, in myeloma, we’ve got a tri specific now coming.

Romantamig, we’re never satisfied with the status quo building on tech and TAL. And in that, if the recommended phase two dose, for patients who had never seen a BCMA or GPRC5D, a hundred percent overall response rate. So we really see great opportunity there to continue to elevate the standard care of myeloma. And then finally, in prostate cancer, have great momentum across our pipeline, most recently reporting, for example, exciting bispecific T cell engager, passritamag, that we think has enormous potential to really transform practice of medicine in prostate. So the momentum across oncology is very robust.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Great. Thanks. Next question, please.

Conference Operator: Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson0: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Joe, the guidance implies an acceleration in the top line growth in the second half of this year. Do you see the 3.5% adjusted operational growth this year as something you could accelerate from next year? And do you see room to improve the operating margin next year beyond the implied, I think, 2.8% in the 2025 guidance?

Thanks for taking the question.

Joe Walk, CFO, Johnson & Johnson: Yeah. Good morning, Larry. Thanks for the question. In terms of overall sales guidance, we’re obviously not going to provide that today. But I think when you look at these quarterly results and the momentum that we have with our in line brands receiving new indications, That certainly and then you complement that with what Jennifer, John and Tim have outlined in in terms of new product introductions.

We certainly see ’26 being better than ’25 in terms of the the growth rate based on what we know today. In terms of margin accretion, I’ll reserve and keep the powder dry until we get a little bit further into this year. We still have some of the effects of Part D redesign that is impacting margins this year. We’ll have to see how tariffs play out. The raise of $0.25 per share in the outlook incorporates $200,000,000, of cost for this year.

But it’s, there’s an accounting function, and I don’t want to get too wonky here in that some of that gets hung up on the balance sheet. So I’d like to see a little bit more things come into view before we really comment on margins. But we certainly appreciate and live by the principle that you have come to know us for, and that’s growing our bottom line consistent, if not better than, our top line.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks, Larry, for the question. And, Kevin, next question, please.

Conference Operator: Certainly. Next question is coming from Assad Hayder from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson1: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on very solid performance in the quarter. Maybe just going back to the external environment, double click a little bit more on your comments on pharma tariffs specifically given this announcement last night from the president that we’re gonna see something by the end of the month that’s gonna start up with a low tariff rate and give companies a year to build. So what do you what do you make of this announcement, and do you have sufficient capacity today to manufacture for The US market in The US? And how flexible is your manufacturing supply chain in The US as it relates to adjusting for any tariff impact in 2026?

Thank you.

Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson: Thank you for the question. This is Joaquin. It’s hard to know, what is going to happen ultimately with tariffs. But what we do know for sure is that the tax policies that just passed are already creating American jobs and and driving innovation. Are these these very policies that just passed are the ones that have enabled our commitment to invest $55,000,000,000 in The US in the next four years.

And our goal is to be able to manufacture in The US all the medicines that are consuming The US at the completion of that plan, and we are on our way of being able to do that.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Great. Thanks. Next question, please.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson2: Great. Thank you so much. So just two product questions on the med tech side. On Ottava, it looks like you pushed out the submission time line to twenty twenty six. Can you just elaborate on what’s going on there?

And then on your EP strategy, you know, you did talk about low neuro rates, you know, but I was just wondering if you could share some feedback that you’re getting from doctors around appetite for adoption of Verapulse. Just what are you hearing? Thank you.

Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson: Well, thank you, Shagun. And just to to clarify, we’re we haven’t pushed out our time lens at all. In fact, we’ve met all of the milestones that we’ve communicated to the market, both in terms of submission late last year, approval late last year, starting the clinical trials and patients in the first quarter of this year and our expectation that we will file for de novo submission in the first quarter of next year. And so feel very confident about the progress that we’re making on Otrava. I think you know clearly why we feel that we have strong differentiation in that program, both on the robot itself as well as our digital environment, and we’ll continue to provide updates as that comes to fruition.

I would like to touch a little on EP, and I appreciate you asking that question because when we look at our performance in the second quarter, clearly, that was a major contributor. And it wasn’t just the EP, it was the 22% that we enjoyed across the cardiovascular portfolio, which is a combination of the performance, by the way, double digit growth in both Abiomed and Shockwave ahead of our deal model expectations and improved performance in electrophysiology. And I have to say, Shagun, that given that we created the EP category, for us, this one is very personal. And while I know that several analysts were quick to write us off earlier this year, we continue to remain very confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long term. And that growth you saw in the second quarter, 10%.

Keep in mind, that’s over $5,000,000,000 base and that represented a sequential growth of over 9% versus Q1 and acceleration within the quarter. And to your question, what drove this? It really was the continued adoption of Varipulse. As we expanded in all commercial regions. We also started first cases in new markets like China, which is a major market for us, and Australia.

And the feedback from physicians has been phenomenal. We’ve now surpassed ten thousand cases globally with a reported neurovascular event rate of below zero point five. This is well below what we observed in the ADMIRE IDE trial and consistent with published rates across other competitive PFA platforms. We’re also further optimizing the catheter based on real world evidence and partnership with clinicians. In fact, we recently received FDA approval for an IFU update to incorporate and optimize flow rate, which further advances the product’s performance.

We’re also evaluating new ways for Varipulse to maximize ablation efficiencies and potentially widen its therapeutic window. I will say and I’ll say very bluntly, we are confident that we have a highly competitive catheter in Varipulse. It provides excellent safety and precision. It’s efficient with only four ablations per vein and a smooth learning curve even for first time users. And it’s also important to mention that Varipulse accommodates competitive advantages like the only approved zero fluoro solution and deep sedation workflows, which we know are a major benefit to hospitals and patients.

And as we look beyond Varipulse, we are bringing to market a comprehensive portfolio of next generation PFA catheters to address a broad range of workflows and patient needs. I think you know already that we received EU approval for our dual energy STSF catheter, the first catheter offer both PFA and RF technology. And we’re also working on an Omnipulse large tip focal catheter and announced positive trials in the month of April. I do think it’s also worth reinforcing that our strength, as we said from the very beginning, is not just down to ablation catheters, but rather the breadth of our portfolio and the end to end solutions we provide to our electrophysiology customers. It’s our entrenched footprint and installed base of 5,000 Cardo systems, which is widely recognized as the benchmark in mapping software.

It’s our broad network of highly trained mappers, which we continue to expand. And just to highlight this point, the strategic differentiation of Cardo and our mappers has even in light of the competition we face here in The U. S. Enabled us to retain our leadership in mapping U. S.

PFA cases. And finally, it’s our market leading navigation and ultrasound catheters further strengthened with the recent launch of the Soundstar crystal ultrasound catheter earlier this year. EP is currently, I think it’s fair to say, probably the most exciting category in medtech. And let me be clear, we are not rolling over. We are in fact increasingly confident that our thirty years of experience and our full portfolio of offerings positions us well to continue to retain our global leadership position over the long term.

Thank you, Shagun.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks, Shagun and Tim. Next question please.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Alex Hammond from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson3: Thanks for taking the question. For TAR200, can you walk us through J and J’s launch strategy? Are there Salesforce training, supply chain, patient access, and urologist education programs in place? And as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the ultimate patient penetration here?

Jennifer Talbot, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson: Hi. Thanks so much for that question. So first of all, we think that there is an extraordinary opportunity here. There’s six hundred thousand new patients that are diagnosed each year and another four hundred thousand that are recurrent. So we really see the opportunity as quite large.

We’ll be entering in the first indication in patients that are experienced or have failed BCG. But shortly then after we’ll be expanding into that broad non muscle invasive space. And so we do think that there’s a lot of patients that are eligible for treatment. You know, I think this product really represents the best of what J and J can bring forward. And we have capitalized not only on the strength of innovative medicine in developing this, but also the strength of med tech with everything from the engineers to catheter development to the J and J institutes, the training that they have run really, really best in class, best in industry so that we can bring forward, a product that will very, very quickly be able to work with urologists, with their practices and to help get this product out to patients.

So the launch, I’m not going to go into all the details, around the launch planning, but suffice to say that the planning is very, very well underway and the team is very excited for, what we’re optimistically think is going to be a very successful launch for patients here.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks, Alex. Next question, please.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is now live.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson4: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for for taking the question, and congrats on a a really good quarter. Darren, what a great quarter to to So just a just a question on med tech. I mean, you guys are are already growing closer or in line with the broader market. You do have some underperformers still in med tech and surgery and orthopedics, but you’ve highlighted a few avenues from new product launch perspective and improving execution to getting those back to line with with market growth.

You’re weathering, you know, EP headwinds. So if we look ahead to 2026, ’27, is it fair to think of the med tech business as a closer to high single digit growth business? I mean, how do we think about the impact of these new product launches and some of the underperformers, the potential for them to reaccelerate and what that means given that you’re already back to sort of 5% plus growth in medtech even with them continuing to underperform? I hope that question makes sense. Thanks so much.

Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson: No, it does, Danielle, and thank There’s a first firstly a couple of drivers that we’re very confident will continue to perform extremely well and accelerate as we look to the next few years. Certainly, our performance in cardiovascular, as I mentioned, the 22% growth in the second quarter, we believe that’s going to be a constant growth driver. Surgery, while you pointed out, has been, I’d say, an underperformer relative to some of our new entrants in that space. We are very confident that we’re going to build on our leadership position both in open and laparoscopic surgery with the launch of Otrava, which you know is on the horizon. I’d say the two biggest growth drivers for MedTech going forward will be cardiovascular and our surgery business, especially as we enter the robotics space.

We believe that our vision business will continue to be a mid single digit to high digit single digit performer. And then we continue, as I mentioned earlier, to look at how we continue to improve our performance in our orthopedics and getting that up to in market performance. You know that in late twenty twenty four, we mentioned that as part of the EBR, we would grow in that roughly 5% to 7% range at the upper range through 22% to 27% on an operational basis, and we’re very confident in our ability to deliver that. I wouldn’t want to speculate beyond that at this point in time. Thank you, Daniel.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks, Daniel. We have time for one last question.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Pammo Devan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.

: Great. Thanks for getting in my question. And again, congrats on the quarter and the performance. So I just had one pipeline question on the innovative medicine side that’s on your co antibody therapy four eight zero four. I thought we might see some of the psoriatic arthritis data already this year at EULAR, but we didn’t see that.

We were hoping to see the IBD data later this year. I’m just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on when we should expect to see those two readouts. And then just your general level of enthusiasm, I assume. You have at least some of this data in house, you had a chance to see how the competitive dynamics are playing out in the immunology space. So I’d love to just kinda get an updated sense of your perspective on on four eight zero four’s potential.

Thank you.

John Reed, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine Research and Development, Johnson & Johnson: Yeah. John Reed here. Maybe start, and then others can supplement. But, the forty eight zero four studies, these are phase two b’s, one in Crohn’s disease, another colitis. We’ll be reading out sometime middle of this year, so it’s nearing the time when the data may become available.

And then based on that, we’ll make decisions about next steps. As you know, in the earlier phase two a study, we saw really compelling data there that it looked like this combination of an IL-twenty three inhibitor together with a TNF inhibitor, two products that have been in our pipeline, but coming together could break through the traditional efficacy ceilings in patients with difficult to treat inflammatory bowel disease and give, perhaps more than half of those patients the chance at sustainable complete remission. So we’re excited about this coantibody therapeutic. It will be the first of many, such approaches to trying to address these difficult to treat patients, down the line. And so, we’re excited to be in a leadership role there, the first company to really begin this kind of foray of looking at going beyond monotherapies to dual therapies to address this really complex patients.

I would say while I’m on that though, I’m super excited about our icotrokinra, the oral targeted peptide inhibitor of the IL-twenty three receptor, which did achieve a compelling proof of concept in ulcerative colitis. We’ll be showing those data later this year at a medical meeting. We have begun gearing up now to do a broad phase three campaign in both UC and Crohn’s disease based on those compelling data. And we think we’re on the cusp of being able to offer the convenience of a once a day pill together with efficacy on par with the best of the biologics and with a, pristine safety profile. So a lot of momentum in immunology across multiple indications, but, IBD, in particular.

Darren Snellgrove, Vice President of Investor Relations, Johnson & Johnson: Thanks, Pamela, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your interest in J and J. I’ll now turn the call over to Joaquin for some closing remarks.

Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, Johnson & Johnson: Thank you for joining the call today. Our Q2 results reflect the depth and strength of our uniquely diversified business. And as you heard, we expect elevated growth in the second half of the year. We have a lot to look forward over the next six months with game changing approvals and submissions anticipated in areas like lung and bladder cancer, major depressive disorder, psoriasis, surgery and cardiovascular. These milestones will extend and improve lives in transformative ways and deliver significant value to patients and shareholders.

Thank you for your continued interest in Johnson and Johnson and enjoy the rest of the day.

BMO Capital cited a report from Insurance Insider Media that Sompo Holdings, which has approximately $19.5 billion in shareholders’ equity, is discussing a potential acquisition of Apollo-backed Aspen, which has about $2.7 billion in shareholders’ equity. According to InvestingPro data, Aspen maintains a GOOD financial health score and trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 5.18.

Apollo Private Equity, which currently owns approximately 82% of Aspen’s shares, acquired the insurer in 2019 for just over one times book value and has reportedly been seeking a strategic buyer for years, according to BMO Capital. Currently, Aspen trades at 0.96 times book value, suggesting potential value for investors. InvestingPro subscribers can access additional valuation metrics and 6 more exclusive insights about Aspen’s financial position.

Sompo has previously demonstrated interest in expanding its non-Japanese insurance operations, which already represent more than 50% of its earnings. The Japanese firm purchased Endurance in 2016 for approximately $6.3 billion at a price-to-book value multiple of about 1.36 times.

BMO Capital noted that Sompo had previously shown interest in purchasing Axa (EPA: )’s reinsurance division, while Aspen’s current management team has experience in bringing insurance companies to market, having successfully taken Brit Group public before selling it to Fairfax.

In financial developments, Aspen Insurance has priced a $300 million public offering of senior notes due in 2030, with proceeds intended to repay outstanding debt. On the earnings front, Goldman Sachs has lowered its price target for Aspen Insurance to $33, citing weakening conditions in specialty insurance and reinsurance markets. Similarly, Jefferies adjusted its price target to $38, attributing the change to a mixed growth outlook and softening market conditions in short-term insurance lines.

In leadership updates, Aspen Insurance has appointed John Welch as Group Chief Underwriting Officer, effective August 1, 2025. Welch brings over 30 years of experience from global insurance firms such as AXA XL and XL Catlin Group.

The Trump administration has aggressively sought to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal.
In May, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS designations for Venezuelans.","SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court on Wednesday sided with the Trump administration and halted for now a lower court's order that had kept in place temporary protections for 60,000 migrants from Central America and Nepal.

This means that the Republican administration can move toward removing an estimated 7,000 people from Nepal whose Temporary Protected Status designations expired Aug. 5. The TPS designations and legal status of 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans are set to expire Sept. 8, at which point they will become eligible for removal.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco granted the emergency stay pending an appeal as lead plaintiff National TPS Alliance alleges that the administration acted unlawfully in ending Temporary Protected Status designations for people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal.

""The district court's order granting plaintiffs' motion to postpone, entered July 31, 2025, is stayed pending further order of this court,"" wrote the judges, who are appointees of Democrat Bill Clinton and Republicans George W. Bush and Donald Trump.

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary, preventing migrants from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively sought to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It's part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Immigrant rights advocates say TPS holders from Nepal have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade while people from Honduras and Nicaragua have lived in the country for 26 years, after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 devastated both countries.

""The Trump administration is systematically de-documenting immigrants who have lived lawfully in this country for decades, raising U.S.-citizen children, starting businesses, and contributing to their communities,"" said Jessica Bansal, attorney at the National Day Laborer Organization, in a statement.

Noem ended the programs after determining that conditions no longer warranted protections.

In a sharply written July 31 order, U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco kept the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.

She said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an ""objective review of the country conditions,"" such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

In response, Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary at DHS, said, ""TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades.""

The Trump administration has already terminated TPS designations for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits in federal courts.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that Noem's decisions are unlawful because they were predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus.

But Drew Ensign, a U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, said at a hearing Tuesday that the government suffers an ongoing irreparable harm from its ""inability to carry out the programs that it has determined are warranted.""

Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Gerardo Torres said Wednesday that the appellate decision was unfortunate. He said the government hopes to at least buy time for Hondurans with the temporary status so they can seek out another way to stay legally in the U.S.

""We're going to wait to see what the National TPS Alliance decides, it's possible the case could be elevated to the United States Supreme Court, but we have to wait,"" he said.

In May, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS designations for Venezuelans.

“Whether you’ve been with our company for just a few days — I know we have a new hire who’s starting tomorrow — or you’ve been with me for 20 plus years, we’re really, really appreciative of every single one of you,” owner Lauren Holmberg said to staff minutes before opening.

“We definitely wanted to make sure we captured this side of the town and we’re here for all the expansion,” Holmberg said. “Apartments, the Ford dealership … new Centerra development, potentially King Soopers — that’s all being talked about.”

The new location has multiple features that should better the customer and employee experience, Holmberg said. She added that there are cash handlers for kiosk orders, easy pickup for delivery drivers, and an efficient kitchen setup that allows for faster service and less waiting in the kitchen to use equipment.

“It’s really optimized for them (the crew), so it’s trying to make their lives easier, whether that be more efficiency, less steps, less places they have to go to get things,” Holmberg said.

This Loveland McDonald’s will also be hosting events to support the local community, Holmberg said, adding that she already started planning teacher night for September where a portion of profits from the evening will support a local school.

Royal Philips has introduced the Philips Lumea IPL, a new hair removal device that utilizes intense pulsed light technology to inhibit hair growth. The device provides a gentle and effective alternative to traditional hair removal methods and requires only two sessions to show visible results. With over 90% of unwanted hair gone after three sessions, Philips Lumea IPL is clinically proven to deliver long-lasting smooth skin. The device is available exclusively on Amazon at a suggested retail price of $399.99 - $579.99, with an extended five-year warranty upon registration [1].

The Lumea IPL is part of Philips' strategic expansion into the high-margin beauty technology sector. The device leverages Philips' established expertise in healthcare and personal care, positioning it to capture market share in the growing at-home beauty device market [1]. The product's SenseIQ Technology and specialized attachments for different body areas demonstrate Philips' focus on differentiation through technology and user experience in a crowded beauty tech marketplace [1].

The US launch of the Lumea IPL expands Philips' recurring revenue opportunities through replacement cartridges and accessories, while strengthening its position in the personal care category. The exclusive Amazon distribution strategy suggests a targeted direct-to-consumer approach that could yield higher margins while providing valuable consumer data and reducing traditional retail costs [1].

Philips' entry into the US beauty tech market comes at a time when consumer demand for professional-grade at-home beauty solutions is increasing, driven by the ongoing preference for salon alternatives post-pandemic [1]. The Lumea IPL's competitive advantages, including requiring half as many treatments as competing brands and delivering results in just three sessions with 90% hair reduction, highlight Philips' commitment to innovation and consumer satisfaction [1].

The three Bills are the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025; the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025; and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025.
The Constitutional amendment Bill will require the support of at least two-thirds of the members in both houses.
Owaisi said it allows executive agencies a free run by becoming the judge, jury and executioner based on flimsy allegations and suspicion, putting chief ministers and ministers at their mercy.","Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday introduced three Bills in the Lok Sabha for the removal of prime minister, chief ministers and ministers under arrest for 30 consecutive days on serious charges, drawing fierce protests from Opposition MPs who tore up copies of the draft law and marched close to his seat shouting slogans.

In a charged atmosphere, several Opposition MPs spoke against the introduction of the Bills, claiming they violated constitutional principles, targeted federalism, turned the jurisprudence ‘innocent until proven guilty’ on its head, were open to misuse for political reasons and threatened to turn the country into a police state.

Shah, however, batted for an enhanced standing for moral values in public life, saying, “We cannot be so shameless that we continue to occupy constitutional positions while facing serious charges”.

On his proposal, the Bills were sent by the House to a Joint Parliament Committee (JPC) comprising 21 members from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha for scrutiny. The committee, whose members will soon be named, has been asked to submit its report to the House by the last day of the first week of the next session, expected in the third week of November.

As soon as the Bills were introduced soon after 2 pm, Opposition members trooped into the well, raising slogans and some even tore copies of the Bill in front of Shah. A few BJP members, including Union ministers Kiren Rijiju and Ravneet Singh Bittu, stepped out of their seats to prevent Opposition members from coming near Shah and waved them to go back to their side of the aisle.

When Congress MP KC Venugopal questioned Shah about his claim of public morality by referring to his arrest in a criminal case when he was the home minister of Gujarat in 2010, the senior BJP leader hit back.

He said he wanted to set the record straight as he had resigned on moral grounds before his arrest on “false” allegations and did not join a constitutional position till he was discharged by the courts.

“What are they (Opposition) teaching us about morality? I had resigned. And I want moral values to rise. We cannot be so shameless that we continue to occupy constitutional positions while facing charges. I resigned before arrest,” Shah said.

Opposition MPs, including AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi and Congress’ Manish Tewari and Venugopal and RSP’s NK Premachandran, spoke against the introduction, terming the proposed law against the Constitution and federalism.

The Home Minister also said that the Bills will be sent to the JPC, where members of both Houses, including those from the Opposition, would get an opportunity to give their suggestions.

The three Bills are the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025; the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025; and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025.

The Constitutional amendment Bill will require the support of at least two-thirds of the members in both houses. The ruling alliance currently lacks such a majority on its own.

The Bills have proposed that if prime minister, union ministers or chief ministers, are arrested and detained in custody for 30 consecutive days for offences that attract a jail term of at least five years, they will lose their jobs on the 31st day.

Demanding that Shah withdraw the Bills, Tewari said they were “squarely destructive” of the basic structure of the Constitution and turned the fundamental principle of the rule of law that a person is innocent till proven guilty on its head.

The Bills give due procedure a go-by and make an investigating officer the “boss of prime minister of India”, he asserted.

The Congress MP said the proposed law distorts parliamentary democracy by undermining the will of the people through mere custody bereft of judicial determination. It also opens the door for political misuse by the state’s instruments whose arbitrary conduct has been “frowned” upon by the Supreme Court, he added.

Owaisi said it allows executive agencies a free run by becoming the judge, jury and executioner based on flimsy allegations and suspicion, putting chief ministers and ministers at their mercy.

He accused the Governmentof being hell-bent on creating a police state, likening it to Nazi Germany’s secret police service, the Gestapo.

Venugopal accused the Bills were aimed at sabotaging India’s federal structure.

The home minister, meanwhile, rejected Premachandran’s contention that the Bills were brought in haste, saying they will be sent to the joint committee, where members of both Houses would get an opportunity to give their suggestions.

Due to the noisy protests, Speaker Om Birla adjourned the House briefly. The Bills were introduced and then sent to the joint committee after the House reconvened at 3 pm.

BJP leaders have linked the need for the Bills to the decision of then-Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to continue to hold the post for months after his arrest in a corruption case and the incidence of several ministers in different states, including V Senthil Balaji in Tamil Nadu, following a similar practice.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 05:02:45.381123

Full transcript - ArcelorMittal SA ADR (MT) Q2 2025:

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Daniel Fairclough from the Investor Relations team. Thank you for joining this call to discuss ArcelorMittal’s performance and progress during the 2025. Leading today’s call will be our CFO, Mr. Joino Cristina.

Before we begin, I would like to mention a few housekeeping items. As usual, we will not be going through the results presentation in detail, but we published it this morning on our website for your information. I do want to draw your attention to the disclaimers that are on slide number 25 of that presentation. As normal, Jean Reno will make some opening remarks before moving directly to the Q and A session. So to ask a question, please do press star one one on your keypad to join the queue.

Over to you, Gemino.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Daniel, and welcome everyone, and thanks for joining today’s call. As usual, I will keep my remarks brief, Beginning with safety, a core value for our company. We are less than one year into what we know will be at least a three year transformation to implement the six core safety recommendations post the audit last year. Already, our enhanced safety assurance model has improved oversight and consistency. I’m encouraged by the progress we are making and the determination that I see in my colleagues to drive lasting change and achieve our targets as quickly as possible.

Now, I want to focus this quarter on three key points. First and foremost, our results continue to show structural improvements. Second quarter EBITDA increased as expected and at $135 per ton, our margin continues to show that the benefits of our asset optimization and growth strategy are delivering structurally higher margins. Our strategic projects have good momentum. Liberia posted a record volume quarter.

Our India renewables project is delivering all the performance that was expected and more. And the commissioning of our new value added capacity at Hazira is underway. Our strategic projects together with the impacts of recently completed M and A are an important support to our EBITDA profile. Compared to 2024 base, the impact on future normalized EBITDA is now expected to be $2,100,000,000 a third of which is due to be captured in the current financial year. Acetelomitau has a unique asset portfolio and this creates significant optionality for high return strategic investments.

So, I’m confident that we can maintain our growth momentum. My second point is that full ownership of Calvert is a very positive development for Assalamito. Calvert is the premier steelmaking facility in The United States and a cornerstone of our North America franchise. Achieved a new shipment record in the second quarter, 10% higher than the first quarter and 10% above the same period last year. Since 2014, Calvert has invested over £2,000,000,000 in improving its asset base and product portfolio.

The biggest investment has been the new state of the art EAS, which is ramping up right now and could not have been better timed. Along with the new seven year domestic slab supply contract, Calvert’s highest quality finished steel will meet US melted and pooled requirements. And we will continue to invest in US. Our project to build a new world class non grain oriented electrical steel facility in Alabama is well underway. This will be a billion dollar investment over the next few years with first production anticipated in 2027.

And then of course, we have the second EAF at Calvert, a decision on which will be taken as part of our next capital allocation cycle. My final point is on Europe, where we are transitioning to a more favorable market structure. We have the promise of a trade defense mechanism that protects the domestic industry and a carbon border that truly delivers a level playing field. A lot still needs to be actioned over the second half of this year. But if the European Commission delivers then our business should be in a far better position to deliver the margins and returns on capital it is capable of when not suppressed by unfair trade.

Added to this more favorable mix is the prospect of demand support from low interest rates and higher investment in defense and infrastructure. Our market position and product capabilities place Alethanol mittal favorably to capitalize on the opportunities these trends should create. Putting this all together, Assalambito is in a strong position, both operationally and financially. Our optimized asset portfolio is delivering structurally higher margins. And with the outlook supported by our strategic growth projects, this should continue.

The value we are creating is being compounded by our share buybacks. Over the past four and a half years, we have bought back 38% of our equity. Each OcelorMittal share now represents a greater proportion of our capacity, a bigger share of our leading franchise businesses, a larger stake in our growth projects, and a greater ownership of our unique business in India. With that, Daniel, I believe we can start the Q and A.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Great, thank you, Jemmina. Just to remind everybody, if you do want to join the queue to ask a question, please do press star one one on your telephone keypad. We do have a good queue in front of us already. And we will take the first question please from Alan at Morgan Stanley. Hi, Alain.

Please go ahead and ask your question. Hi.

Alan, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions, if I may. The first one is on the EBITDA building blocks into Q3 twenty twenty five. Can you walk us through the different moving parts, including the ASP in Europe and North America, the dollar impact of tariffs on North America and the power outage impact on Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico, if you don’t mind? That’s my first question.

Thanks.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Thank you, Ola. So I will start with your second question on Mexico, then as usual, Daniel will walk you through the moving blocks. So in quarter two, as you can see, and as highlighted in our earnings, we faced operational issues with one of our transformers. So that impacted the production of our EIF. That has been restored.

The EAF, as you know, that’s our most important part the business as the flat business. So that is up and running again. Nevertheless, as we disclosed in our NDA of our NAFTA segment, we experienced $40,000,000 of losses because of the operational issues in quarter two. We have subsequently taken the decision to bring down the furnace that is producing for the long business for maintenance. And this furnace will most likely continue to be down for the next couple of months as we perform this maintenance.

So that’s why, and then we will comment, we will continue to see shipments at same level as you see in quarter two coming from Mexico. So we will get back the shipments from flat, but then you will see a reduction in shipments because the furnace is down. But on quarter then shipments should be relatively stable for Mexico. Daniel, do you want to talk about the moving parts?

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Shimina. So I think what I’d like to do is just focus on the key moving parts and we can get into any of these in more detail as you wish, Alan. But I think as we look from the second quarter to the third quarter and the bridge between the two quarters, I think the first thing to be anticipating is the impact of normal seasonally lower volumes in the Europe segment. I think that’s going to be the key driver for Europe performance quarter to quarter, normal seasonality of volumes.

Second factor to look out for is in the North America segment. Yes, we will see marginally higher tariff costs, Section two thirty two tariff costs, but that will be more than offset by the impacts of the Calvert consolidation. And then the third factor I would be looking out for in the Q2 to Q3 bridge is the impact of lower volumes in the mining segment because we did see some volume catch up in the second quarter and that won’t then repeat into Q3. So mining volumes will sort of come down a little bit in Q3, but that should be the main impact in mining because so far quarter to date pricing is a little bit higher than last quarter. So those are the main three factors I would be thinking about in terms of the bridge from Q2 to Q3.

Alan, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Thank you. And the cost at Mexico, should we assume still same cost Q on Q or is there going to be an increase in the cost run rate because of the stoppage?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yes, that’s a good reference, Sala. So, the $40,000,000 is a good reference.

Alan, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Thank you. And my second question is on Calvert. So, we can see the path to being slab self sufficient in The U. S.

At Calvert in the medium term. But in the short term, you’re still highly dependent on imported material for your slabs. How do you plan to mitigate the risk of tariffs should the current 50% level remain unchanged versus Mexico and Brazil? Would you be changing the flows? How would you change the mechanics of the business?

Thank you.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Well, I think what is important Alliance as you know, well, I mean, we have the AIF that is ramping up, right? And then the new agreement that was signed with DuPont Steel and US Steel for a new slab supply agreement that will guarantee cover to what it needs in terms of melted and poor materials in The United States. And then of course, coverables do need to be importing slabs from either Brazil or Mexico. So we don’t see that changing in the near future. But as you can see, I mean, a lot of the tariffs impact is kind of already captured in our Q2 results, right?

So as Daniel said, going forward, the increased incremental impact of tariffs is not so significant. And as you can see in the results of CALVERGE, it’s really exceptional, right? So the run rate is getting very close to $900,000,000 So coverage is doing extremely well, record levels of shipments in quarter two. Where we really COVID is not really the concern. I think the concern at this point is really the flows from Canada through The U.

S, right? That’s where we see the biggest impact today.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Thank you. Very clear. Great. Thanks a lot. So we’ll move to the next question, which we will take from Efraim at Citi.

Hi, Efraim. Please go ahead.

Efraim, Analyst, Citi: Thanks. On the Calvert second EAF, you said in the next CapEx capital allocation cycle, would be considering. Could you be a bit more specific at the time of that? Is it 2026 or is it 2025? And the second question regarding your comment on record iron ore shipments from Liberia, I think it should be doing about 5,000,000 per quarter at full ramp up.

So it’s and it looks like you’re doing close to 3,000,000 tons in the second quarter. Is that correct? And how should we think about the contribution margin of the additional tons, I suppose, at $100 benchmark iron ore, you’ll be getting about $80 per ton additional contribution margin given the cost basis relatively fixed. Thank you.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah. So, as in the first part of your question, the second, think we have been very clear that that is something that we see as natural for the next step for COVID. We are advancing our studies and I’m sure we’re going to be in a position to update you more. Most likely, I would say in our quarter four results. I’m not saying that there will be a decision at that point in time, but we are progressing our studies and this is something that just makes a lot of sense for us giving everything that we are seeing.

And then of course, as we have been discussing, a lot of investments have already been made in anticipation of the second year, right? So CapEx wise, it should also make sense to move forward with this. Timing wise, you’re going need to bear with us for a little longer. In Liberia, our guidance for Liberia this year is 10,000,000 tonnes of shipments. So, can see that the run rate in H1 is about 8,000,000 tonnes.

So, we have commissioned the first line. So, it’s the first line of the concentrate it’s running. That’s about 5,000,000 tons. So, and we’re going to be commissioning the other two lines as we progress now in the second half. So in quarter three, the level of shipments that you’re going to see is going to be largely the same.

You’re not going to see an increase in shipments in quarter three, but you’re going to see already a changing mix. So, you’re going to see more center feed concentrate being shipped out of Liberia and less DSO. And then in quarter four with the three lines running, then we’re going to be at higher levels of shipments. And we are comfortable at this point that we’re going to be achieving our 10,000,000 tons guidance. And then of course, with the new product, you should also expect that profitability will increase and we will detail that more as we talked about quarter three.

Thank you.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Great. Thanks, Efraim. So we will move now to take the next question from Boris Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, Boris.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: Hi. Hello. Thank you for taking my question. The first question would be on tariffs. I’ve read a headline where you were quoting estimating the impact of tariffs to EUR 150,000,000.

That means there is something like EUR 50,000,000 of mitigating measures. Can you share the way you mitigate those impacts? And just confirm that the impact in Q1 was around EUR $130,000,000 already? And regarding CapEx, just back to that question on the second EAF, how confident are you to maintain your CapEx envelope of EUR 4,500,000,000.0 to 5,000,000,000 over time? Thank you.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, sure. Yeah, I can confirm Boris. So in quarter two, we incurred about $140,000,000 in costs with Section two thirty two tariffs. As we discussed in Q1, the expectation was for this number to be lower, about $100,000,000 But of course, we had the increase in tariffs impacting us from June. What we have been doing really is, as you can imagine, the whole organization, the whole Canadian team, they have been doing a tremendous job looking for opportunities to mitigate the impacts.

And that’s why we’re confident here to guide for a number that is lower than otherwise we would have expected when we reported Q2 numbers. So that’s the $150,000,000 So the net net from one quarter to the other, it’s in the range of $10,000,000 right? So, and what we have been doing is, of course, discussing with our customers on sharing tariffs, looking at our cost base. So a significant amount of work being done there to make sure that we can continue to supply the OEMs. We, as you know, what we sell into The US is high value added materials, important not only for us, but also for our customers.

And that’s our focus to make sure that we can maintain our market share with the OEMs and make sure that we can also generate a profit with these volumes. And then, sorry, there is a second part of your question, Boris. With the second half, how are comfortable that we can manage? Look, I mean, we are finishing this year a number of projects, right? So we guided for this year to spend between 1,300,000,000.0 and 1,500,000,000.0 with growth projects.

But you should not forget that we’re going to be completing this year Liberia, which has assumed a significant amount of the envelope. So we’ll be completing some of the smaller projects in Brazil as well. So we’re going to be making a room for new projects that I’m sure we’re to be in a position to discuss together with our results in quarter four.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Great. Thanks, Boris. So, I think we’ll move to the next question, which we’ll be taking from Tom at Barclays.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my Hi,

Tom, Analyst, Barclays: Yes. Hi. Sorry, I’m going have to come back to it. Just on tariffs one more time. Could you just to sort of check our understanding on why there’s so little increase, I suppose, into Q3 even though from June, you’ve only had one month basically of 50% tariffs.

And you then had the consolidation of Calvert. So as I understand, you used to be sending about 2,000,000 tons of slab every year from mostly Brazil into the Calvert JV. Those costs used to be shared with Nippon, but now you’re basically absorbing 100% of those costs. Are you basically just saying most of these tariff costs have just been passed on to customers and that’s why you’re not absorbing anymore? And is that true out of Calvert as well?

That’s the first question.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, look, as I said, I mean, would just reiterate, I think we have been working on mitigating these impacts, right? And as you can imagine, a lot of initiatives, a lot of discussions with our customers. So we are going to be sharing tariffs with customers as well. So that’s why net net, the increase should not be so significant. That is not much

Tom, Analyst, Barclays: And our thought process around the slab movement, that’s correct as well, right? You’re now basically absorbing all of those slab tariff costs instead of sharing it with Nippon?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: That’s right. Because now we have to so that’s two things. Let’s just make sure that we don’t mix them. Right? One is the supply agreement with US steel facilities.

So that has nothing to do with supply within The United States. So there is no tariffs there. And then the tariffs, of course, will be applicable for imports from either Brazil or Mexico. But then as you can see, I mean, as we talked about, when you see the performance of COVID, you can see that it’s actually the profitability of that facility is actually increasing. And I should remind you that even before the costs that of these labs that were being supplied to COVID, they were under our responsibility, under Salamita’s responsibility.

And that’s why we were capturing already part of the EBITDA in our segment, right? As we explained in our release, just to make sure that it’s clear.

Tom, Analyst, Barclays: Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. And then second one, maybe just moving on to Europe. We’ve seen some attempted price hikes through Q3.

We’re seeing a little bit of raw material cost inflation with iron ore and coking coal. Maybe just some color in general on what you’re seeing in the European market at the moment. Are you seeing any sort of inventory build ahead of CBAM and safeguard replacements? Or are you seeing still quite a slow market? Just curious, how you see prices sort of developing in the second half?

Thank you.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yes. Well, dynamics, I mean, we talked about the fact that demand in Europe at best has been moving sideways. We feel that and that remains a positive aspect that inventory levels in the system that we believe they continue to be low. What is interesting, of course, is the fact that we’re going to have CBAM in whatever form kicking in from GYN and the promise of revised safeguards. So that creates different dynamics as well, right?

Because if you are importing material and given the long lead times, so you’re going to start to worry about some of these factors, right? So that is positive for the domestic meals. But right now because of some of course activities are slow. But I think we are about to see in Europe, as I said at the beginning of my opening remarks, important developments, right? So we are all waiting to see really the actions that the commission will pass into legislation.

And it’s encouraging. And also the agreement between US and Europe with regards to coming together to find ways to ring fence the industry against the biggest issue that we face today. That is, of course, the overcapacity in China, right? I think that is also something that, of course, we don’t have yet the details, but the fact that the problem is acknowledged and there is a goodwill to try to address it, that should be extremely positive for our business.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: Okay, clear. Thank you. I’ll turn it back.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Tom. So, we’ll move now to the next question, which we’ll take from Dominic at JPMorgan. Hi, Dominic. Please go ahead.

Dominic, Analyst, JPMorgan: Thanks for taking my question. My questions also relate to Europe. So I just wondered if I could maybe push you a little bit more on safeguards in terms of what you would think would be acceptable for the industry as a whole? And I guess I’m also interested in the timing of the European Commission announcement with your recent indication that you’re going to restart the volumes at Dunkirk. Could you just maybe give us some timing?

That an expression of confidence in the market in the second half? And again, just really interested in a bit more detail on how you think about safeguards evolving in the months ahead.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, well, regarding safeguards, we and by we, I mean the industry through Eurofair, the request is that we limit through our quarters the level of imports to a market share that is more consistent with primaries, which is about 15% of the market share. Right? And that is the request. And as we know last year in 2024, the market share of imports were as high as 27%. Right?

So that is a significant if implemented, it will be a significant boost to utilization rates of the steel industry in Europe and will allow investments to happen. So that’s going to be extremely positive for the industry in Europe. And then of course, the quota, then we believe that we should have also 50% of tariffs during what we have under Section two thirty two. Right? Coming to Dunkirk, Dunkirk was just a normal Reliant, which we completed during the second quarter.

We had built these slab inventories before, So you should not read into it. So we just completed the re line. We brought the furnace up and we are running again. So nothing really just normal business there.

Dominic, Analyst, JPMorgan: Okay. And then just second question, really helpful on the CapEx reiteration at the 4,500,000,000.0 to $5,000,000,000 But I guess in light of the question and your comments, could you maybe just give us again an updated comment on how you’re thinking about decarbonization CapEx longer term in Europe at the present moment?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah. Well, our expectation is that this is going to happen gradually, Dominique. This is a transition that will take the case to be completed. What we have indicated is that provided that we have the right policies in place, and by that we mean we have CBAM, we have effective trade protection, we have competitive power prices, then we are ready to invest, And we have indicated that we are prepared to move ahead with significant investment at Dunkirk with a large EIF. And that’s what we would see going forward that we will progressively, provided that we have the conditions, to keep them investing in new EIS.

And I would remind you that, so we are investing today. So we are spending about $300,000,000 in GCAM projects. It happened we invested this amount in 2024, and we have a similar amount this year. So we are executing or building a new app in Spain, Gui Houle. We are investing in Sistal, so that’s 1,600,000.0 tonnes EAF flat business.

So we are progressing. And then of course we should not forget the renewable investments. And I think as a company we are well placed. We have the DRI facilities. We are one of the largest producers in the world.

So I think we believe that we are progressing quite well.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: Thank you.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Thanks Dominic. So we’ll move now to the next question, which we’re going to take from Max at ODDO. Please go ahead, Max.

Max, Analyst, ODDO: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a first question. It’s on the HBI unit in Texas. Can you shed more light on your procurement there?

Because I understand a lot comes from Brazil and it’s now taxed at 50%. So are you able to shift the sourcing or are you facing some extra costs there?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Sebastian. Well, we have the flexibility marks because we can also bring materials from our own mines in Canada, right? But I believe that, to be honest, I believe that it has been included on the list of exemptions. I have to double check to be 100% sure, but that was my reading came out yesterday, right? So I need to confirm that, but I think that was because pig iron is now for sure not.

I think, I don’t know, it’s also Daniel, unless you have some more.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: No, that’s the case, Jeremy. But I think these things can change. So it’s important, your first point, to have that flexibility that should something change that we can source from a different mine within our own system and that would be Canada.

Max, Analyst, ODDO: Okay. So that’s clear. Second question is on M and A. So, Clevencliffe has put up a for sale sign in its latest results call. So I know you don’t like to comment on specific targets, but how are you thinking of further expansion in The U.

S. Notably to address the mismatch you currently have in terms of organic versus M and A?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yes, you’re right. So we don’t really comment on M and A. I would just say that US is and has always been a very important market for the company. Right? And as you can see, our investments covered the new electrical steels plant that we are investing.

So we do have the ambition to keep growing in The United States and we have plans in place and being developed. But more specifically on M and A, I’m not going to be able to comment.

Max, Analyst, ODDO: Okay, fair enough. And just the last one, it’s on India. So you’re flagging again your ambition there to grow even more, not at least for a new greenfield facility, but at the same time, we are seeing prices in India quite depressed at just a few tens of dollars of premium to the Chinese market. So wouldn’t it be wiser to wait to have, I mean, better credit defense system there to potentially start new investments because clearly the 12% of safeguard tariffs we’ve had for a few months are not enough.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, I think the industry would agree with you. And I think the meals are mobilized. Look, I mean, we have to look beyond this. Right? And structurally, the Indian market is very attractive.

Right? So it’s highly concentrated. It’s a market that is growing 78% every year. And if you want to continue to be relevant in that market and you want to keep your markets increase your markets, so you have to grow with the market. And as you can see in our results this quarter as well, the results already doubled, so back to 200 plus million.

You can argue that yet not enough, it’s and we have not yet seen the benefits of some of these investments that we talked about, the downstream. So our automotive complex is going to decommission part of it now and towards the second half of the year. So we’ll continue to improve the mix of products that we’re going to be able to offer in the Indian market. So we remain very excited about the opportunities provided by Indian market. Right now the focus is on completing the expansion in Azirah and of course prepare the ground for future expansion.

As you know, this is a long process in India and it’s important that we continue to work so that we can when the moment is right to move forward.

Max, Analyst, ODDO: Okay, very clear. Thanks. Thank you.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Max. So we’ll move now to take the next question from Andy at UBS. Hi, Andy. Please go ahead.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Yes.

Andy, Analyst, UBS: Cool. Excellent. Just to follow-up on M and A, no specific targets, but obviously the net debt after Calvert is now back above $8,000,000,000 you used to sort of talk about a $7,000,000,000 target, albeit obviously the business is very different now. I mean, how are you thinking about leverage more broadly around the potential for further M and A? I mean,

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: does this

Andy, Analyst, UBS: rule out large scale M and A, things like Valorac or I mean, the Cliffs, I mean, we’re not being specific. I mean, are you thinking you can do something large or are we talking like potentially small incremental stuff from here or, you know, just focusing on some of your organic growth projects, are obviously pretty numerous in your portfolio? How are you thinking about that more big picture?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, well, can say that we have a good pipeline of projects that we can execute organically, right? So that has been the focus, continues to be the focus. And specifically on, and I should also say that our message on Vallorec remains the same, right? So we are happy with the performance of the company. We are happy with our stake.

We have no intention there to increase it. When it comes to the debt, billion. First of all, I think we feel very comfortable. As I’m sure you have seen, we were just upgraded by S and P, right? BBB flat.

So showing the progress, all the progress that we have been discussing acknowledged by the rating agencies as well. And we should not forget that with these investments, M and A, we are adding significant amount of extra EBITDA to the business. Right? You’ve seen our bridge in our debt. So this year, 700,000,000 of extra EBITDA coming from projects, but also M and A.

So that’s how we are looking at, so very comfortable with the capital structure of the company.

Andy, Analyst, UBS: Okay. And just one other follow-up on the settlement that you put into one of the one offs for the EBIT in the quarter, this Votorantin. When do you actually expect to make sort of cash payments on that settlement and how’s that phased?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: It will happen over three years.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Okay. And it’s So

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: that is one down payment and then divided by four, have one on signing and three other payments in three years. So it’s going to happen over three years.

Andy, Analyst, UBS: Okay. And that’s in line with the EBIT loss that you booked on that settlement, right, In cash.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: EBITDA loss. Well, actually, if you look at the footnote, you’re gonna see that the amount is 500. Right? And then what you see in our P and L is the difference because we had already some provisions. So that’s why you see a delta between the P and L and the footnote, but that’s about $100,000,000 So the settlement is $500,000,000 Okay.

Andy, Analyst, UBS: That’s clear. Thank you.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Great. Thanks, Andy. So we have time for two or three more questions. So the first we’re gonna take from Bastian at Deutsche Bank. Hi, Bastian.

Bastian, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Yes. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is actually on your project pipeline. I saw in the footnote that there are some projects which are delayed.

And I was wondering if this is purely due to permitting. Is this also a response to the current environment? And are there any further shifts or delays which you currently at least looking at? Maybe you could also give us an update on the EBITDA cadence. I think the chart here in the presentation deck seems to be changed.

So there must be something which is compensating for the delay there. That’s my first one.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yeah. So, basically, you have a Mardic in North Of France, that’s the electrical steel project there, Sebastian. And as we write there, every time you have a brownfield, you always face, you know, the risk that you can, you may find out something that you could not have anticipated. That’s one of the reasons. And then in Mexico, in one of the mine was to show so it was the delays primarily because of licenses that delayed some of the moving of the equipments.

But these are not very significant movements, I would say. They are quite minor. So that’s why you don’t really see a significant, any important change in the beta bridge coming from projects and M and A. Daniel, anything to

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: I would only reinforce those points, I mean, no. So, yeah, no further additional comments.

Bastian, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: And no other projects which you’re currently looking to move just given the current economic environment, I guess?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: No. Not at all. And I and I think that’s that’s a good point because despite the the challenging market conditions, we feel that the company is very well positioned, right, to move forward with the projects. And as we talked about, this year we’re going to be completing a number of projects, right? And then as you can see, then we’re going to have another significant pickup in EBITDA also in 2026.

So we want just to keep that momentum. And on the contrary, you should see us announcing more projects as we talked about in our Q4 results.

Bastian, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Okay. Got you. Then my second one is on your Brazilian slab strategy. I guess a few years ago, you obviously bought CSP, which is basically a slab business. You still have Sierra Victoria, which is basically long slabs used to supply both, I guess, into Calvert or into The U.

S. And North American market. Now given that there is obviously a pretty long list of capacity projects in The U. S. At the moment, I mean, you’ve just built like the 1,500,000 tonne EF, you’re talking about a second one.

What’s going to be your strategy here for the Brazilian slab capacity where you’re still long?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yes. Well, I think that’s a good question, Larsen. And we are very well positioned in the Brazilian market. So first of all, I think it’s important to acknowledge that Brazil is growing, right? So the flat demand is growing and it will continue to grow.

And we are well positioned because we have the crude steel capacity, right? So we don’t need to invest in developing or building a new upstream. So we have, so if you look at some of our competitors there, that’s the real differential that we have to grow with that market, right? So that’s one of the possibilities that we have. And we should not forget also that the Sen and Tuparan, produce some of the highest quality slabs in the world.

Right? You’re not going to find that quality of slab everywhere. So we feel that we’re going to be always in a position to market the volumes that we have from there.

Bastian, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Okay, very clear. Thanks so much.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Bastian. So we’ll move now to the next question, which we’re going to take from Tristan at BNP Hexane. Hi Tristan.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal0: Yes, hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just two. The first one on China, what is your take on the recent official commentary on potential capacity restructuring? I mean, do you believe a significant capacity cuts like in 2015, 2016 are really on the table?

And also you kept a stable demand outlook for the year in China despite what I think was pretty weak H1. So what are you baking in into H2 and why would you have a more constructive setup for H2? That’d be my first question.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Do you want to take that one, Daniel?

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, absolutely. So I think relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year. So yes, in China, they’re obviously seeing some export impacts from the reciprocal tariffs environment, but they are finding opportunities, obviously new export opportunities and then domestically demand is being supported by the infrastructure spend and efforts to stimulate domestic consumption. So that’s the reason why we’ve not significantly changed our projections for Chinese demand relative to what we’d published back in February. I think on the prospect of capacity reform, obviously this is something that we have been championing, something that it’s very obvious that this needs to occur.

China has a capacity imbalance. It’s leading to very depressed profitability within the domestic industry. It’s leading to aggressive exports at very low pricing and as we talked about in previous questions, it is a significant source of unfair competition for the rest of the global industry. So reform needs to happen and your question obviously is will it happen and over what sort of timeframe. All the statements that we’ve read over the last couple of months would give you encouragement that things will improve.

I think if you look at the recent production statistics, it would suggest that things can improve. However, exports do remain very elevated and I think the only thing that we can really be looking out for is this ring fencing that Jim We know talked about previously. That’s what’s required. We can’t assume that China will reform its industry in due course and therefore the other regions need to appropriately ring fence their industries to make sure that they’re not damaged by that excess capacity and unfair trade.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal0: All right. That’s helpful. Thank you. And my second question is just going back to the steel action plan. There’s been a specific proposal to cut quotas by 40, 50%.

Do you think there’s a real probability that the European Commission will take such action? How confident are you? Basically, is different this time in your conversation with the Commission? For instance, if we look at it, I mean, the fact that Germany was not part of the recent proposal could indicate that there is not a united front from all the member states. Any color there that’d be great.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Tristan, I think we can only wait, right? And see finally what what comes out. Of course, we are engaged through our association. So we are in very close dialogue with the authorities, governments, the commission, encouraging. France published recently a position paper in which they also defend these levels of quotas, right?

But I agree with you, in Europe, it’s challenging. That’s why we have to really wait and see and see what finally gets converted into legislation, right? And I guess we will know very soon. I mean, the promise is to deliver the new proposal after summer. So I think we should know relatively soon.

Tom, Analyst, Barclays: All right, thank you.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Tristan. So, we’ll move to our last question, which we will take from Matt at Goldman Sachs. Hi, Matt. Please go ahead.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal1: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in there. My first question is just on India. Encouraging to see those tariffs in April positively contribute to your margins. And I have to say the quarter uplift is quite impressive.

So my question is what was the exit margin at the end of the quarter on a per tonne basis, if you happen to have that to hand? And how should we think about it the go forward in light of both the tariffs and commissioning of the downstream value added products?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: So I’m not sure that I got the first part of the question, Daniel.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: Would you like

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal1: me to repeat? Yes, sure. Okay. My question was just the margins that you’ve seen, the quarter on quarter uplift in India has been quite impressive. So the question is just what was your exit margin at the June?

And then how should we think about the go forward just given the effect of the tariff but also the commissioning of the downstream?

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Matt, perhaps I talked about the moving parts there, right, in a little bit more detail. So moving forward, I mean, quarter three, and I think it will address your first part of your question. So our expectation is for profitability to be largely stable compared to what you see in quarter two, right, which I think addresses some of your points, stable. And the downstream really, I mean, course, there will be a good contribution in terms of extra margin, right, that we’re going to be able to print. But more importantly, we’ll open up a new avenue in terms of product offering in the market, right?

So both us and Nippon, as you know, Alto is a franchise of our companies and it’s a market that we’re going to be able then to address strongly once we complete these investments. And as you know, I mean, these are profitable products. So I will not get into specifics, but just to give you a flavor of the importance of completing these projects for the future of the profitability AMN SI. Daniel, if you have anything to add because you were there recently as well.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Yeah, absolutely, Gemini. So it is an important part. When we took investors to India to see the expansion of the capacity and the new value add capacity that you were just talking about. I think this is all a very important part of the transformation of the business. So as we go from the current capacity, as we add the two new blast furnaces, we add the coat capacity, we add the new finishing capabilities, higher the value product opportunities and this will really transform the profitability of our business in India.

So you shouldn’t think that the doubling of capacity will double profitability. Really you should think that the doubling of capacity underway will add 150% to the normalized profitability and a lot of that additional profitability will come through this higher added value product mix.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal1: That’s helpful. Thank you. And my last question is just on cover. Congrats on the first slab. How should we think about the ramp up from here to the 1,500,000 tonnes by mid twenty twenty six?

And if you can give any color sort of on the margin uplift alongside that ramp up. Thanks.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Yes. I mean, we talked about, I think it was in the previous quarter, Amit. So it should take us about a year to get to full capacity there, right? So we had a couple of weeks of delays to have the first slab casted. So our expectation is to get to the end of the year with a run rate in the range of 60%.

And then from there, we will continue to ramp up. So by end of second quarter next year, we should be at full capacity.

Boris, Analyst, Kepler Cheuvreux: That’s great. Thank you.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Great. And then what we perhaps just to add in terms of the margin profitability, if you think about the cost of the EAF, it should be very similar to the Brazil slab cost. So when you think about the impact on our business, that should be a pretty good guide for you.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Thanks, Daniel.

Daniel Fairclough, Investor Relations, ArcelorMittal: Great. So that was our last question, Germino. So over to back to you.

Gemino Cristina, CFO, ArcelorMittal: Okay. Thank you everyone. Before we close, I want to reiterate my messages from the beginning of the call. First and foremost, our results continue to show structural improvements and this is expected to continue. Secondly, our North America franchise is well positioned.

We now own 100% of culvert, the best steel facility in The US. This is the cornerstone of our franchise and the new EAF together with the new slab supply agreement to ensure we meet melted and pooled requirements. Third, we are transitioning to a more favorable market structure in Europe. If the European Commission delivers a new trade defense mechanism and an effective C band, then our business can flourish. And AcelorMittal is well positioned to capitalise on the opportunities created by defence and infrastructure investments.

And finally, to repeat what I have said in recent calls, returning capital to shareholders at the bottom of the cycle, while continuing to invest in growth is clear evidence of the progress that Salamitro has made and demonstrates that our company can deliver value through all aspects of this suicide. With that said, I will close today’s call. And if you need anything further, please do reach out to Daniel and his team. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Wish you all a happy summer.

Stay safe and keep those around you safe as well. Thank you very much.

This is a compelling look at how our 2025 Women Influencers—three of the office technology industry's leading voices—view the evolution of the industry and what they see as essential to its success.”

— CJ Cannata, president and CEO

HAMBURG, NJ, UNITED STATES, August 20, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Cannata Report has released a new video featuring candid insights from three leading executives in the office technology industry: Mary Hart of HP, Jennifer Healy of Ricoh, and Sarah Henderson of Nexera/MPS Monitor. Together, they discuss the most significant changes reshaping the industry today, from the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) to digital transformation, evolving customer expectations, and the challenge of attracting the next generation of talent.

Mary Hart, Head of U.S. Commercial Channel Print at HP, underscores the rapid pace of technological change, noting how quickly AI has moved from a new concept to an everyday tool. She emphasizes HP's focus on the future of work and the importance of helping customers be both productive and engaged, while also supporting dealers to meet shifting customer needs. Says Hart, ""Over the next five to ten years, I think it's going to be essential for the industry to continue to look at new business models as technology is reinvented. We know that technology is moving so quickly. Continuing to adapt and continuing to be able to understand what our customers want, and to be able to deliver it in a way that our customers need, is going to be essential.""

Jennifer Healy, VP, Business Development & Experience, Dealer Partner Channel, Ricoh North America, highlights digital transformation as the defining change of the moment, with data security and AI integration at its core. She shares Ricoh's long-term strategy of ""Build, Buy, Partner""—a holistic approach to solving customer challenges that includes developing in-house solutions, acquiring companies like DocuWare to strengthen AI capabilities, and forging key partnerships such as Ricoh's recent collaboration with Brother. ""Security is a big thing that's evolving because there are so many breaches,"" she says, adding, ""And what is the balance with AI? That's the big question I'm hearing from dealers everywhere.""

Sarah Henderson, Regional Director, NEXERA and MPS Monitor, stresses the importance of attracting younger generations of talent to the office technology industry, noting that their paperless perspective will play a vital role in shaping future customer behaviors and expectations. She also sees AI adoption as a critical industry shift, particularly in making massive datasets more actionable and embedding AI into workflows and imaging devices. ""When you think about a copy or a printer or a traditional imaging machine, the adoption of AI technology into that control panel, into workflow, and scan to cloud technology is going to make the machines more relevant and also easily attachable into the network environment where maybe people thought print was a standalone,” says Henderson.

""This video provides a compelling look at how our 2025 Women Influencers— three of the office technology industry's leading voices—view the evolution of the industry and what they see as essential to its success, including AI adoption, meeting the evolving needs of customers in the future workplace, security and data protection in tandem with digital transformation, as well as an emphasis on an industry reinvention complete with new business models and business strategies, "" says CJ Cannata, president and CEO, The Cannata Report. ""Hart, Healy and Henderson emphasize that collaboration, innovation, and adaptability will be key to the industry's continued success,"" says Cannata.

Current HIV prevention guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, supported by HHS, only include three older drugs: generic Truvada, Gilead’s Descovy, and ViiV Healthcare’s Apretude.
AIDS advocates criticized CVS’s position, calling it a missed opportunity given Yeztugo’s potential to transform HIV prevention.
On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for CVS Health was ‘bullish’ amid ‘normal’ message volume.","CVS Health, which operates the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, will not add Gilead Sciences’ new HIV prevention drug Yeztugo to its commercial or Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans for now.

The decision was based on clinical, financial, and regulatory factors, according to a Reuters report. The company added that its ACA preventive program follows recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Current HIV prevention guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, supported by HHS, only include three older drugs: generic Truvada, Gilead’s Descovy, and ViiV Healthcare’s Apretude.

Yeztugo, a twice-yearly injection with a U.S. list price of more than $28,000, was approved in June and shown in large trials to be nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV infection.

CVS and Gilead reportedly remain in negotiations.

AIDS advocates criticized CVS’s position, calling it a missed opportunity given Yeztugo’s potential to transform HIV prevention. Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, said the decision reflects unsustainable drug pricing in the U.S.

Gilead said it is encouraged by its payer discussions and expects 75% of U.S. insurers to cover Yeztugo by the end of 2025 and 90% by mid-2026.

U.S. government programs including the Veterans Administration and Medicare have already added the drug, while several state Medicaid plans, including California and New York, are covering it.

UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx said it will assess Yeztugo in the coming weeks.

CVS Caremark, OptumRx, and Express Scripts together control about 70% of specialty drug prescriptions in the United States.

In a separate setback, a federal judge ordered CVS Health’s Caremark unit to pay nearly $290 million in a Medicare fraud case.

The court found that Caremark caused false information to be submitted to Medicare, and in a June 25 opinion, concluded that the company’s actions led to 513 false reports being filed in 2013 and 2014.

Based on those findings, the judge tripled damages to $285 million and added $4.9 million in penalties, bringing the total judgment to $289.9 million.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for CVS Health was ‘bullish’ amid ‘normal’ message volume.

Algoma Steel Inc. has started using the heat cast off by the arcs of powerful electric currents to make greener steel.","Algoma Steel Inc. has started using the heat cast off by the arcs of powerful electric currents to make greener steel.

Electric arc furnaces are nothing new—the technology is more than a century old, and there’s already a few in Canada, The Canadian Press reports. But Algoma is calling the achievement of production from its first of the kind furnace in Sault Ste. Marie last month a win as it faces an existential threat from U.S. tariffs.

“We have reached a truly pivotal milestone for Algoma and the Canadian steel industry,” said CEO Michael Garcia on a recent earnings call.

“Despite the uncertainty that the trade war has unleashed, this achievement reinforces our confidence in our transformation strategy.”

Part of that strategy has been to dramatically reduce emissions in an attempt to differentiate its products; it even trademarked Volta as the name for its cleaner steel that it plans to produce from a mix of low-emission iron feed and scrap metal.

But experts say the project is coming online as the market for green steel, and the metal more generally, faces turmoil from tariffs and price pressures, making it unclear what financial advantages producers may get from the big upfront investments needed.

Competing with China

It also faces international competition from China, where state-owned steelmaker HBIS Group signed a deal last month to sell more than 10,000 tonnes of green steel to a buyer in Italy, Canary Media reports. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also committed to work with China to build out green steel production.

Canary Media says the United States is already falling behind China in the green steel race, with manufacturers backing away from their past commitments to make iron from green hydrogen and Donald Trump pressing the industry to redeploy Biden-era grants into coal-fired iron production.

“A lot of the rhetoric around competitiveness with China makes it seem like we think we must not fall behind. Stories like this make clear we already are behind,” said Marcela Mulholland, a former U.S. Department of Energy who now leads Clean Tomorrow, a non-partisan climate advocacy group.

“It is happening. The green steel example is just one of many.”

For Algoma, “the question is, will the demand be there? Is there going to be sufficient demand in North America for green steel?” Chris Bataille, who researches the steel transition as an adjunct research fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told CP.

“The U.S. was starting to move fairly quickly in terms of moving to electric vehicles and to cleaner steel and everything else under the last administration, but now we’ve got a complete U-turn.”

Steel emissions had been a priority in the U.S., and remains one in Canada, because using coal to produce steel is so emissions intensive, CP explains. Steel production accounts about 8% of global carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

But while it makes sense from an emissions perspective, buyers willing to pay a premium for the more eco-friendly steel have mostly been limited to the auto sector, said Bataille.

European automakers have been paying a premium of as much as 40% for the cleaner material, since they can use it for marketing while only adding a little to the end cost of a car, but the more important building sector has been more hesitant, he said.

There is still demand in Europe, a region where Canada has looked to diversify its exports. But with tariffs causing disruption there, too, it’s not clear how much potential there is, said trade expert Tommaso Ferretti.

“There is a structural demand in Europe, but to what extent that structural demand will remain in place, it’s a big question mark,” said the assistant professor at the University of Ottawa’s Telfer School of Management.

Garcia has warned that Algoma doesn’t see much potential to sell to Europe, or anywhere else internationally.

“We can put our steel on an ocean-going ship here in Sault Ste. Marie, but getting it to an export customer in Europe or elsewhere, there just aren’t those opportunities right now. I don’t think that there’ll be a lot of those opportunities going forward, to be frank,” he said.

Stuck in Neutral

The challenges help explain why the other flagship green steel project in Canada, at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario, operations, is stuck in neutral.

The company made a big show of announcing in 2022 that it was moving ahead with a $1.8-billion project to move to green steel, CP writes. But the last updates show the project is still at the engineering stage, with a spokesperson confirming there are no new milestones to report.

Wider oversupply issues in the industry that have pushed down prices is part of the problem, as are doubts about policies like carbon pricing, said Bataille.

“There’s some uncertainty about how fast the transition will go,” he said. “It’s just a difficult business to make a buck, to be honest.”

ArcelorMittal said in its latest sustainability report in April that it doesn’t expect green steel projects to be economical until the 2030s, and that policies will be needed to address the high capital and operational costs.

The path to green steel production is complicated for China, as well, and Canary Media has the details. But “China’s commitment clearly highlights its intent to seize commercial opportunities in the green steel market, especially in Europe,” Nicole Voigt, the Boston Consulting Group’s global lead of metals,. told the U.S. climate news outlet.

In Canada, federal and provincial governments have stepped in to help steelmakers with the capital costs of converting to electric arc, CP writes. Algoma received $420 million to help cover the more than $880 million cost of its project, while ArcelorMittal was offered $900 million to help ease its overall costs.

Unlike Algoma, ArcelorMittal’s plans also include building a plant in Hamilton to remove oxygen from iron ore using hydrogen, rather than coal—a process that remains expensive, leading to several recent project cancellations.

Trump Shifts Funding to Coal

ArcelorMittal itself just cancelled two green steel projects in Germany in June, citing high electricity prices, while last year it noted the future of several other of its European steel projects is unclear because “there is limited willingness among customers to pay premiums for low-carbon emissions steel.”

Cleveland-Cliffs, which bought Hamilton-based Stelco Holdings Inc. last year, recently shelved plans for green steel conversion at a U.S. plant that already had US$500 million in government funding secured. That’s the investment that Trump now wants diverted into coal-fired production.

Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves cited the lack of clear hydrogen supply as part of the reason for cancelling the project. He said on a July earnings call that plans to revamp the operation using existing resources, including “beautiful coal,” generates a very good conversation with the current U.S. Department of Energy.

Ferretti worries that the pressures the industry is facing will also mean less investment in research and development to try and bring costs down.

He said there needs to be even greater collaboration between the public and private sector for the critical industry to chart a path forward.

“The real question in fact is to see … the collaboration between the companies, the steel manufacturers, Canadian government, and their ability to reinvent themselves.”

For Bataille, that path could include using Canada’s vast renewable energy and iron ore deposits to build a direct reduction plant for processing closer to the source, and then shipping the already oxygen-reduced iron around the world.

“You could triple the value of those exports,” said Bataille.

“So on the one hand we face headwinds and the Chinese overcapacity continues, but on the other hand, I think there’s new possibilities open in shipping green iron places that, you know, we hadn’t considered before.”

That’s why I am honored and excited to be named the next CEO,” says Fiddelke.
As CEO, Mike has to make Target a better company.
Eliminate the Chief Guest Experience Officer position, and move the responsibilities under Sarah Travis (Chief Digital & Revenue Officer).
Everything from merchandising to store operations will improve.” Hire Colin Yankee, Chief Supply Chain Officer, at Tractor Supply Company, and name him CSCO.","The CEO of Target is stepping down, as the retailer grapples with weak sales and an ongoing customer boycott over its scaling back of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Brian Cornell will be replaced next year by Michael Fiddelke, Chief Operating Officer.

“During my time at Target, I’ve had the chance to learn from incredible leaders, work alongside amazingly talented teams and develop a fierce love for this company and the special role it holds in our guests’ lives. That’s why I am honored and excited to be named the next CEO,” says Fiddelke.

“Getting Target back to growth is my top priority. We’ll need to operate differently, move with urgency and focus, and make bold choices to get there. We have the foundation to build new momentum, and I’m eager to accelerate work already underway and find new ways to deliver the incredible products and experiences our guests expect from us.”

He adds: “Thank you to the many mentors, peers, friends, and family - and especially Brian Cornell, for his steady leadership, support, and laying the groundwork for our future success. I’m excited for what’s ahead and proud to be taking this step forward with the best team in retail.”

In a LinkedIn post, Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant and former Amazon executive, said: “Mike has worked hard since joining Target in 2003. I have named him as the preferred internal CEO candidate multiple times since 2023. However, all is not well in Targetland.”

“The majority of retail analysts and consultants believe that Target should have hired a CEO from outside the company. I've stated in multiple posts that Richard Dickson, Hal Lawton, Chris Nicholas, or Greg Hicks, should be considered for the role.”

“Retail executives at Target and competitors speak highly of Mike. But a senior executive stated, he is a dairy farmer. He'll make sure the cows are milked twice a day. Target needs someone to reinvent dairy farming. That isn't Mike.""

He added: “The consensus appears to be that he lacks the ability to think big, he isn't innovative, and that Target chose him to be CEO because they know he will continue following Brian Cornell's strategy. The status quo is safe. Mike won't make any major changes. He can silence the naysayers by embracing the following: Leadership is about courage. As CEO, Mike has to make Target a better company. Period.”

Ladd believes that Fiddelke must do the following:

Hire six new senior executives. Replace the executives who joined Target in the 1990s and early 2000s. Eliminate the Chief Guest Experience Officer position, and move the responsibilities under Sarah Travis (Chief Digital & Revenue Officer). “This will significantly make Target a better company. Everything from merchandising to store operations will improve.”

Hire Colin Yankee, Chief Supply Chain Officer, at Tractor Supply Company, and name him CSCO.

Fix or divest the grocery business. Partner with Publix Super Markets or Lidl US to open stores inside Target's stores, or divest the business to Whole Foods Market.

Contact Alex Karp, CEO at Palantir Technologies, and ask to meet with him. “Target is in the Stone Age when compared to Palantir's AI and software capabilities. This is a must have,” Ladd argues.

Assess implementing aspects of what is arguably the most innovative department store in North America from Canadian Tire Corporation. “The future of Target is up to you, Mike. Are you going to milk cows or invent a new dairy farm? I sincerely wish you the best,” Ladd concluded.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/590eeff5b8a79b2147a783be/590ef147e6f2e1fda30e84c5/68a5e2b3cca89f260703049d/1755752741661/Taylor_Product_1.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-08-21 07:07:25.403816

A federal judge has ruled against Elevance Health in its lawsuit challenging the government's decision to lower its Medicare Advantage quality ratings.
This decision follows a series of lawsuits filed by insurers challenging the 2025 Medicare Advantage star ratings.
Last month, another Texas federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Humana, which had challenged the reduction in its star ratings.
Elevance Health, which provides Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., has not yet responded to a request for comment.","Elevance Health's lawsuit over Medicare Advantage ratings has been rejected by a federal judge. The insurer claimed the government's rating calculation was flawed, resulting in a $375M revenue loss. However, the judge upheld the government's methodology, dealing a blow to Elevance Health's efforts to dispute the ratings.

A federal judge has ruled against Elevance Health in its lawsuit challenging the government's decision to lower its Medicare Advantage quality ratings. The company had argued that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) acted unfairly in reducing its star ratings, which are used to assess the performance of Medicare Advantage plans [1].

Elevance Health contended that the lowered ratings were unjustified and could negatively impact its business operations. However, the judge upheld CMS’s methodology and decision-making process, stating it fell within regulatory guidelines. The star rating system is a critical factor for insurers, as higher ratings can lead to increased enrollment and financial bonuses from the government [2].

The ruling comes as a setback for Elevance Health, which had argued that CMS's calculations for the ratings were flawed. The company claimed that the agency's improper rounding cost it at least $375 million in revenue [3]. The judge noted that Elevance had not identified any significant flaws in CMS's highly technical rating approach that would merit judicial intervention.

This decision follows a series of lawsuits filed by insurers challenging the 2025 Medicare Advantage star ratings. Last month, another Texas federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Humana, which had challenged the reduction in its star ratings. The judge found that Humana had failed to exhaust all of its out-of-court options to challenge the ratings [3].

The ruling underscores the importance of the star rating system in the Medicare Advantage market. It also highlights the complexity of the rating methodology and the challenges faced by insurers in challenging the ratings. Elevance Health, which provides Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., has not yet responded to a request for comment.

ID5,AXA,2025-08-21 04:06:53+00:00,The Argus,Insurers order removal of 200-year-old oak trees in Billingshurst - The Argus,Annabel Stock,,,,,https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/25402093.insurers-order-removal-200-year-old-oak-trees-billingshurst/,"The oak trees, which are located on Willow Drive in Billingshurst are both over 200 years old.
Inspired by the Save Cowfold Oak campaign, residents in Billingshurst have set up Save Billi Oaks and are campaigning to stop insurers Axa from felling the two trees.
The trees are “allegedly implicated in a subsidence claim to a nearby property,” Gabi said.
“This is going to happen more and more, and specifically to oak trees, because all of these houses are built on Wealden clay.
""I would like to feel hopeful that these magnificent oak trees and the wildlife they support will have the final say,” she said.","The oak trees, which are located on Willow Drive in Billingshurst are both over 200 years old.

In January this year, residents of nearby Cowfold set up “Camp Oakley” around a 150-year-old oak tree, successfully warding off contractors who were set to chop it down.

Inspired by the Save Cowfold Oak campaign, residents in Billingshurst have set up Save Billi Oaks and are campaigning to stop insurers Axa from felling the two trees.

An online petition has racked up almost 1,500 signatures.

Residents say they only became aware of the insurance company’s plans when they discovered a tree surgeon surveying the trees for a quote.

“The tree surgeon said we’re not doing it, they’re mature, healthy 200-year-old oaks”, said Gabi Barrett, a member of Save Cowfold Oaks who has been advising Billingshurst residents on their campaign.

The trees are “allegedly implicated in a subsidence claim to a nearby property,” Gabi said.

“A root barrier is a viable option, but Axa seems to be insisting they go with the cheaper option.

“This is going to happen more and more, and specifically to oak trees, because all of these houses are built on Wealden clay. Clay expands and contracts and creates cracks in properties and they need to build deeper foundations.

“Felling the trees probably won’t resolve the issue and then they will insist on felling the third tree on Willow Drive.”

Although all three oaks have TPOs (tree protection orders), Horsham District Council has granted permission for two to be felled.

But residents like Sarah Mendes da Costa want “Axa to stop axing”.

She is “hugely concerned” about the “detrimental impact” the loss of the trees would have on the bats which roost in them.

“I am fearful"", she said. ""I would like to feel hopeful that these magnificent oak trees and the wildlife they support will have the final say,” she said.

A spokesman for AXA UK said: “We are insurers to a policyholder whose home has been subject to serious subsidence over a number of years caused by nearby tree roots, including two oak trees on Willow Drive.

“We recognise the ecological importance of trees and green spaces across the UK and know that these situations are often complex and concerning for the local community, however, we owe it to our customer to find a solution which protects their property.

“It is also the case that the trees are the property and responsibility of Billingshurst Parish Council and that it has decided to remove the trees in question following multiple investigations by independent specialists.

“We have continued to work with the council to find a solution which protects both our customer’s property and considers the concerns of local residents who wish to see the trees preserved.

“As Billingshurst Parish Council is the owner of the trees, in the circumstances, we understand the council’s decision. Our priority has always been to manage the risks to our customer’s property and to find a solution that addresses their requirements.”

A spokeswoman for Horsham District Council said: “The Council can confirm that consent was sought by an insurance company for the felling of two trees in Willow Drive, Billingshurst.

“It should be noted that whilst the trees are mature in age they are not classified as veteran trees, as they do not meet the strict criteria for such a designation.

""As part of the application to fell the trees, the insurance company provided evidence that the sites are contributing to subsidence of a nearby property. This information was assessed by the council’s qualified arboricultural officers, and the evidence was found to be robust.

""Whilst the Council is of the view that it would be preferable for the insurance company to progress alternative actions that protect both the trees and properties, the council is unable to insist or require that alternatives to felling are pursued.

“Furthermore, the council would also be liable for any compensation costs should the application be refused, which would come from already limited public funds.

“On this occasion the council came to the view that it had no other reasonable option before it than to grant consent for their removal, in order to prevent ongoing nuisance to the nearby property.”",https://www.theargus.co.uk/resources/images/19852212.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-08-21 01:01:07.621190

With the help of its Optum division, the company is further diving into home-based care, focusing on offering treatment in a more comfortable and affordable environment for patients. It aims to reduce hospital admissions, enhance chronic condition management and improve patient satisfaction, which plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes and managing costs.

UNH’s previous acquisition of LHC Group and recent acquisition of Amedisys demonstrate its dedication to this space. Followed by months of regulatory scrutiny, the companies agreed to divest 164 home health and hospice facilities across 19 states to proceed with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Amedisys.

This initiative is a bold jump toward value-based care. It also strengthens its relationship with members. This move will likely boost revenues and increase the number of people served while bringing costs down. The company expects the number of patients served by the fully accountable value-based care model to increase to 5 million in 2025. In the first half of 2025, UNH reported 5.8% year-over-year growth in revenues in its Optum business. We expect the metric to rise 5.7% year over year in 2025.

Home health is gradually evolving as a key component of UNH’s long-term strategy as the U.S. population is aging, which results in an increase in demand for in-home care.

How Are Competitors Faring?

Some of UNH’s major competitors in the value-based care space are Elevance Health, Inc. ELV and Humana Inc. HUM.

Elevance Health’s care delivery services primarily focus on serving chronic and complex populations by offering tailored care in the home and virtually. Elevance Health acquired CareBridge in 2024, which provides virtual care to Medicaid and Medicare patients and helps in plans in managing home and community-based services.

Humana’s CenterWell business offers services like pharmacy, primary care and home health solutions, which are designed to improve the overall healthcare experience. Humana’s revenues from the CenterWell unit rose 8.9% year over year in the first half of 2025.

Medtronic's market value remains significant at $119 billion, despite the recent stock price decline.","Medtronic (MDT) shares dropped despite a corporate reshuffle aimed at boosting M&A. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management became a large shareholder, and two veteran med-tech executives joined the board. The company will form new committees to focus on growth, operations, and M&A opportunities. MDT is undervalued despite being the biggest med-tech company globally by revenue, with a market value of $119 billion.

Medtronic (MDT) shares dropped despite a corporate reshuffle aimed at boosting mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The medical technology giant saw its stock price decline following an activist investor's influence and strategic changes. Elliott Investment Management, a significant shareholder, has been instrumental in driving these changes.

The company appointed two veteran med-tech executives, John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison, to its board. Groetelaars, formerly CEO of Hillrom and Dentsply Sirona, and Jellison, previously CFO of Stryker and board member at Masimo, bring extensive experience in medical technology. The appointments are part of a broader strategy to enhance Medtronic's focus on M&A and core assets.

Additionally, Medtronic will form new committees focused on growth, operations, and M&A opportunities. The growth committee will consider possible acquisitions, R&D investments, and divestitures, while the operations committee will evaluate potential efficiencies and simplify the global manufacturing and supply chain. Both committees will be chaired by Medtronic's CEO, Geoff Martha.

Despite the strategic changes, Medtronic's stock price declined. The company reported strong earnings for the second quarter of 2025, with revenue of $8.58 billion and an 8.4% gain over the same period in 2024. However, the market's reaction to the activist investor's influence and potential operational overhauls, such as a diabetes business spinoff and tariff mitigation efforts, has led to investor caution.

Analysts have expressed mixed sentiments regarding Medtronic's stock performance. While some analysts suggest room for growth with a $97.10 average price target, others remain cautious about the company's strategic direction and operational execution. Medtronic's market value remains significant at $119 billion, despite the recent stock price decline.

The firm assumes coverage of 24 stocks in the food producers, food retail, and agricultural products sectors. JPMorgan's top picks include McCormick (MKC), Albertsons (ACI), Hormel Foods (HRL), and J.M. Smucker (SJM), while being cautious on Beyond Meat (BYND) and General Mills (GIS).

JPMorgan has downgraded Kroger (KR) to Neutral from Overweight, lowering its price target to $75 from $82. The move comes amidst the grocery giant's strategic overhaul, which includes the closure of 60 stores across the United States over the next 18 months to boost profitability [2]. The closures, which target underperforming locations, are part of a broader effort to address operational inefficiencies and strengthen long-term competitiveness.

The strategic shift follows the failed merger with Safeway and Albertsons, which had initially posed a distraction for Kroger. The company is now focusing on improving its business and optimizing its store footprint. The closures are expected to account for approximately 2% of Kroger's total stores, with the company committing to invest between $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion in capital expenditures for new store construction and renovation of existing locations [2].

In addition to the store closures, Kroger has implemented a receipt-checking program at select locations to combat shoplifting. The program involves armed security guards checking customer receipts at the exits of six Columbus stores. While the program has been successful in thwarting thefts at some locations, police records do not show a consistent change in theft reports across the six locations [1]. This mixed effectiveness highlights the complexity of combating retail theft and the need for ongoing evaluation of security measures.

The market's reaction to Kroger's strategic moves remains cautious. While some investors are optimistic about the company's long-term growth prospects, others are concerned about the potential impact of store closures on employment and community stability. The closures, which have sparked community backlash and relocation efforts, underscore the social impact of strategic business decisions [2].

JPMorgan's downgrade reflects a cautious view on Kroger's near-term prospects, despite the company's efforts to address its operational challenges. The firm's top picks in the food retail sector include McCormick (MKC), Albertsons (ACI), Hormel Foods (HRL), and J.M. Smucker (SJM), while it is cautious on Beyond Meat (BYND) and General Mills (GIS) [3].

That includes Medicaid, CHIP or Medicare.
The White House has said that 1.4 million illegal immigrants improperly receive federal Medicaid funds, seemingly referring to a figure found in a report from the Congressional Budget Office.
However, academics have called the statement “unequivocally false,” noting that those individuals receive healthcare coverage via state programs.
Still, the Trump administration has been undeterred in identifying potential abuse of public health programs by undocumented immigrants.","Dive Brief:

The CMS launched an initiative on Tuesday meant to ensure that people enrolled in Medicaid are U.S. citizens or have “satisfactory immigration status,” as the agency continues efforts to stamp out perceived waste, fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs.

To do so, CMS will provide states with monthly lists of beneficiaries whose citizenship or immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases, the first of which went out Tuesday. States are expected to take “appropriate actions” in light of the reports, including making coverage adjustments, the agency said.

The oversight program is part of a broader push from the Trump administration to root out what it says is abuse of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by undocumented immigrants. “Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid and CHIP,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement Tuesday.

Dive Insight:

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has been focused on ensuring non-citizens do not access certain public benefits, including healthcare.

However, illegal immigrants have never been eligible to enroll in federally funded healthcare coverage. That includes Medicaid, CHIP or Medicare. Illegal immigrants also cannot purchase coverage through the ACA marketplaces.

The White House has said that 1.4 million illegal immigrants improperly receive federal Medicaid funds, seemingly referring to a figure found in a report from the Congressional Budget Office. However, academics have called the statement “unequivocally false,” noting that those individuals receive healthcare coverage via state programs. Some states elect to provide healthcare coverage regardless of immigration status, but don’t use federal funds to do so.

Meanwhile, non-citizens who legally immigrated to the U.S. can sometimes receive care, but they make up just a fraction of the Medicaid population. They represented just 6% of total Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries in 2023, according to an analysis from the KFF. Non-citizens were also likely to utilize healthcare services relative to their peers and likely to have lower total healthcare costs, in part due to access barriers, such as language differences.

Still, the Trump administration has been undeterred in identifying potential abuse of public health programs by undocumented immigrants.

In February, the president signed an executive order directing federal agencies to identify federal funded programs that provided financial assistance to undocumented immigrants, including healthcare and social services.

Then, in June, the HHS came under fire for providing the Department of Homeland Security with millions of Medicaid enrollees’ immigration data to potentially augment deportation efforts. The HHS said it was following the president’s executive order.

A coalition of 20 states sued to block the government from sharing enrollees’ personal health data for immigration enforcement decisions and received a preliminary injunction supporting their position earlier this month.

This summer, Congress ushered in its largest coverage change to date when it passed Trump’s reconciliation package. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, only lawful permanent residents, certain Cuban and Haitian nationals and people residing in the country under a compact with a handful of small island nations will be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, according to an analysis from the National Immigration Law Center.

Meanwhile, refugees, asylum seekers, survivors of domestic violence and survivors of human trafficking — who were previously eligible for healthcare — will become ineligible for many healthcare services.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/E4HzuLhVRCwLJGjx_VWHCSsbhZUczSpsfJkVXLVF0hs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMjczOC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-20 23:08:34.609855

The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It's in our Best TVs buying guide as the pick with the most immersive picture. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price.

Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. It also has a few extra features like turn signals, a bell, and self-healing tires. We haven't seen it sell for less.

This is the best price we've seen thus far for our favorite Android tablet. It's not a high-performance powerhouse, but it can handle the tasks that most people need. You can watch videos (even outdoors in bright sunlight), play most games, and use the included stylus to take notes or efficiently browse the web. The battery lasts about 20 hours and only takes about 100 minutes to recharge.

The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) is the iPad we recommend for most people. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which may be a blessing or a curse depending on who you ask. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories.

The M4 Apple MacBook Air is the best MacBook for most people. This is the cheapest we've seen it. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further.

These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort.

Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. It has oodles of adjustable elements, including the arms, armrests, seat depth, recline, lumbar support, and seat tilt. The foam cushion seat is comfortable and the mesh backrest is supportive, too. The affordable price tag is icing on the cake, and while it doesn't go on sale very often, you can save ten percent until the sale ends with code LABORDAY.

If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. It's very easy to assemble and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. Even with its quirks, it will be a definite upgrade if you're still working from the ratty chair you picked up off Craigslist when you first built your home office.

Sitting all day is bad for you! This telescoping desk can be raised up as high as 45 inches, with simple setup and two available sizes. It comes in a few different finishes. The leg motors aren't the quietest, but they work well, and the desk looks great in any setup. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide.

This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. The Freedom Headrest is the best reclining office chair, and it drops from $1,743 to $1,394 with code SEMIANNUAL20. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “this chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. It falls from $1,294 to $1,035 after code.

The Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress is our favorite organic latex mattress. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations.

This is the bed frame I'm currently using, and I love it very much. Assembly wasn't my favorite, but once I got it all put together, I fell in love. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets.

This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations Manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. For a more affordable option, we also like the Benchmade Modern Laguna (pictured above) on sale for $2,397 ($599 off). “My family and I have been sitting on it for a year and a half now, and the single cushion (as well as the rest of the couch’s cushions) is comfortable and supportive,” says reviewer Nena Farrell.

Breeo makes the best upgrade fire pit. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's two feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard.

This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. But it's a great-entry level kitchen composter, and it doesn't drop in price very often.

The Ooni Volt is the very best electric pizza oven. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za.

Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. The bacteriostatic showerhead was able to filter total chlorine down to undetectable levels in reviewer Matthew Korfhage's chloramine-treated water system. This deal is for the automatically-replenishing subscription bundle. Hydroviv says you should replace filters every six months, but you can pause or cancel that subscription if you decide you want to order them separately.

WIRED Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu tested and loved this outdoor couch and armchair set. The couches come with OuterShell, which is a built-in cover that helps protect the couch cushions from the elements (and stray bird poops). The performance fabric is made from recyclable materials, and the covers are machine washable. Julian still has to see how the couch fares New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a ten-year warranty and available in four different fabric options.

We really like this cooler from RTIC, and clipping the on-page coupon gets you 10 percent off the normal price, bringing it within $10 of the best discount we've seen. The rotomolded 45-quart cooler is heavy, but the padded handles make carrying it easier, and tester Martin Cizmar hasn't experienced any issues with ice retention. And unlike coolers from Yeti, this one actually has its full listed capacity available inside. All the better to store your beer.

We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our Couch Buying Guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing.

Home Depot is offering up to 35 percent off a variety of appliances for Labor Day, including washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, and various bundles. This discount also applies to a few robot vacuums that we like from Roborock and iRobot, as well as a large selection of window air conditioners we recommend. If you're in the market for a new home appliance, this sale is worth checking out.","https://media.wired.com/photos/68a5724e2813b477fc9a5eda/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/The%20Best%20Early%20Labor%20Day%20Deals%20and%20Sales.png",N,,2025-08-20 22:03:20.852956

Dividend investing doesn’t have to leave you wondering if the income will really last. The key is choosing a company that has already proven it can keep paying through good times and tough times. That’s where Canadian bank stocks often shine as they’ve built reputations for strong balance sheets, consistent growth, and reliable dividend checks.

Among them, Bank of Montréal (TSX:BMO) has once again shown why long-term investors trust it. With a growing dividend and a track record of rewarding shareholders, it continues to prove why it deserves a place in income-focused portfolios. In this article, I’ll walk through BMO’s latest results, recent growth trends, and why it could be a dividend stock for life.

Why BMO could be a top dividend stock for life

Founded more than 200 years ago, Bank of Montréal serves millions of customers in Canada, the U.S., and other global markets. Currently, BMO shares trade at about $156.13 each, giving it a market cap of $112 billion. Investors holding the stock also enjoy an annualized dividend yield of roughly 4.2%, paid quarterly.

Over the last 12 months, this top Canadian bank stock has climbed more than 33%, with a five-year gain of over 100%. Those returns clearly show that dividend income isn’t the only thing on the table, as investors have also been rewarded with strong capital appreciation.

A closer look at its latest financial results

In the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ended in April), BMO reported adjusted net income of $2.05 billion, slightly higher than a year earlier. Its adjusted quarterly earnings came in at $2.62 per share, also up from $2.59 per share a year ago. At the same time, the bank’s quarterly revenue rose 9% YoY (year over year) to $8.7 billion with the help of higher net interest income and stronger wealth and trading revenue.

Of course, the quarter wasn’t without challenges as BMO set aside $1.05 billion for credit losses, up from $705 million last year, reflecting a cautious approach to a weaker economic backdrop. Still, its common equity tier-one ratio (which mainly shows a bank’s core capital strength) of 13.5% reflects that BMO remains well capitalized and in a position of strength.

Key positive factors to consider

Last quarter, BMO’s Canadian personal and commercial banking segment posted higher revenue from stronger net interest income, although provisions for credit losses held back bottom-line growth. In the U.S. market, loan demand has been muted, but the bank’s strategy to optimize its balance sheet and reduce higher-cost deposits is continuing to support its margin expansion.

Meanwhile, the bank’s wealth management segment saw a strong 13% YoY increase in net income, backed by rising markets and strong asset inflows. Similarly, its capital markets also benefited from robust trading revenue, particularly in commodities, even though higher expenses and credit provisions weighed on results.

It is built for long-term income and stability

When you combine reliable dividend increases, a strong balance sheet, and consistent growth across multiple business lines, you get a stock that can support income investors for the long term.

Besides its reliable payouts, BMO is also actively investing in digital platforms, expanding customer relationships, and building deeper ties in its U.S. markets. That mix of stability and forward-looking growth makes Bank of Montréal a stock that could keep paying you for life, while also letting your portfolio grow in value.

ID5,AXA,2025-08-21 01:24:28+00:00,Mail Online,Physiotherapist reveals why you should NEVER cross your legs on a flight - Daily Mail,"Alesia Fiddler, TRAINEE, www.dailymail.co.uk",,,,,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-15018249/physiotherapist-reveals-never-cross-legs-flight.html,"Many passengers cross their legs on flights, but AXA Health physiotherapist Bethany Tomlinson has warned against the common seating position.
She warns: 'Avoid crossing your legs in your plane seat as this will impact blood flow and increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).'
'Make sure to relax your shoulders and support your back by sitting back into the plane seat whilst you wait.'
Another way to ease joint discomfort is by standing in a certain position, Bethany explains.
The physiotherapist shared a range of mobilising exercises that passengers can easily do from their plane seat, including neck stretches, shoulder rolls and knee hugs.","It can be difficult to get comfortable during plane journeys. With small seats and little leg room there is often not much room for movement.

Many passengers cross their legs on flights, but AXA Health physiotherapist Bethany Tomlinson has warned against the common seating position.

According to research, more than one in 10 adults in the UK experience joint issues.

However, this pain could be worsened by long periods of inactivity sitting on aeroplanes.

Bethany explains the risks that can come with sitting cross-legged during a flight.

She warns: 'Avoid crossing your legs in your plane seat as this will impact blood flow and increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).'

Instead, the expert advises keeping legs elevated and choosing different relaxing positions.

'If there's a footrest under the seat in front of you, use this to keep your legs slightly elevated,' she adds.

'Make sure to relax your shoulders and support your back by sitting back into the plane seat whilst you wait.'

To the millions of Brits jetting off this summer, Bethany urges travellers to prepare for the journey to avoid causing strain on joints.

One in three Brits experience stiffness in their knees, and lack of movement or staying in the same position can only worsen this.

Bethany says: 'Catching flights this summer could turn into an endurance test for our joints, so prepare for every flight like it could be long-haul.

'Knowing how to position your body and doing exercises when seated to keep your joints moving is essential.'

Another way to ease joint discomfort is by standing in a certain position, Bethany explains.

She adds: 'When standing up, shift weight between your feet, keep knees slightly bent and do light stretches to avoid too much pressure on your lower body.'

For longer flights, Bethany shares what routine passengers should keep to in order to ensure their joints are healthy.

'Flyers need to move their body every 1-2 hours on flights to keep joints mobilised.

'Being in the same position for hours can lead to stiff and swollen joints, particularly the knees, ankles and hips.

'Seated exercises whilst in the air will help boost circulation, and reduce the risk of DVT, a common type of blood clot that can form during long periods of sitting.'
